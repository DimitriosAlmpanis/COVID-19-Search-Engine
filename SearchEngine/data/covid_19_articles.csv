"Abdul Qadir Sediqi, Storay Karimi",2/24/2020,reuters,Afghanistan confirms first coronavirus case in province bordering Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-afghanistan/afghanistan-confirms-first-coronavirus-case-in-province-bordering-iran-idUSKCN20I0M0,"Afghanistan confirmed its first case of the coronavirus in the western province of Herat on Monday, declaring a state of emergency in a territory bordering Iran which itself reported a sharp rise in cases. Dozens of cases of the virus, which originated in the central Chinese province of Hubei in December, have been confirmed in Iran where 12 people have died, the highest death toll outside of China. I ask people to try to stay at home and restrict their movements, Health Minister Ferozuddin Feroz told reporters, referring to Heart, the gateway to Iran. Three suspected patients in Herat had recently returned from Iran, Dr Sayed Attaullah Sayedzai, head of the disease surveillance department at ministry of public health, said on Sunday. The confirmed case was a 35-year-old who had recently returned from the city of Qom, home to the majority of Iran's coronavirus cases, and had now been placed in quarantine, Feroz  said. Afghanistan suspended all air and land movement to and from Iran over the weekend. The thing that makes us worried about coronavirus in Afghanistan is that our people, due to weak economy, are already suffering from different diseases and they have weak immune system, Feroz said. Millions of Afghans live in Iran, often coming back and forth by car and bus across the border to see family and seeking works. On Monday, taxi driver Aziz Ahmad told Reuters he saw more than 100 cars with passengers on the Iranian side of the border blocked from reaching Afghanistan. Some passengers said that their visas are expiring and they do not have enough money to stay in Iran, he said. They say the Afghan government is responsible for its own nationals and should seek a solution to these problems. The coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China, mostly in Wuhan, capital of Hubei. Outside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to about 28 countries and territories, with a death toll of around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.

Please see our Privacy Notice for details of your data protection rights. With 88 percent of the nation taking a holiday in 2019, it seems travel is a big investment for Britons. As more people begin to travel, there are more ways to bag a discounted deal. Airline seat sales and flight comparison sites are both popular methods of cutting costs, however, travel experts are discovering there are certain times of the year when demand decreases and thus, so do prices. Having analysed flight data, consumer rights advocate Which? discovered that travellers hoping to book a May bank holiday vacation may be better off doing so now. According to the experts, tourists could save up to 12 percent on flights for the spring bank holiday by booking three months in advance. Which? Travel crunched two years of price data from millions of flights listed on SkyScanner to find out when fares for travel during various holiday periods were lowest. We found that the cheapest flights for the late May bank holiday were available around three months in advance, the report states. READ MORE: Pound to euro exchange rate: No major changes for sterling  Which? explain that prices are largely affected by dynamic pricing instilled by airlines. This means that the cost of tickets increases or decreases based on supply and demand for many airlines including Ryanair and easyJet. Though it isn't always straight forward to predict how in-demand tickets will be, with special events, extreme weather or unexpected political plans often impacting travellers' desires to jet off, Which? utilised data from previous years to offer an estimate. Nobody can say exactly when is the best time to book flights in 2020 they said.

[FCO WARNING]Over 2,000 people stranded on Holland America cruise ship [COMMENT] However, we have good confidence that now is the best time to book for most destinations. Analysing data from 2017 and 2018, the consumer body found that the best time to book holidays for Easter, Christmas and bank holidays was roughly the same each year. Using this knowledge they determined that the seven days following February 24 2020 will be the best time to secure low-cost travel for May. While the best prices for the late spring should be in the next day or two, fares are likely to remain below average for a week or so after 24 February, they said.  The experts also revealed that Easter and Christmas flights tend to be at their lowest price point three months in advance of departure. On the other hand, when it comes to the summer holidays, prices tend to increase rapidly the closer to the data of departure, so booking well in advance is advised. However, if you're looking to make extra savings, it isn't just flights where deals can be found. A hotel insider revealed to Express.co.uk that there are some unexpected yet savvy tips you can use to bag a bargain when booking your hotel stay.  From days of the week to payment methods, Pav Klair, Spa Relations Expert at SpaSeekers explains that there are some handy tricks holidaymakers often miss when planning their stay. These include being flexible about your dates of travel and avoiding certain days of the week. It goes without saying that Friday and Saturday nights are usually our most expensive, so wherever you can try and stay mid-week, advised Pav. The prices will be better, the facilities will be less busy and your stay will be overall more relaxing. Additionally, opting to pay in advance rather than on arrival can slice the overall cost of the experience. Pav explains: Package rates are designed to appeal to a larger audience especially the pay in advance rates, as hotels are under more pressure on the day to fill, it helps them if they have a better indication of numbers for planning room allocations, housekeeping and numbers to cater for in restaurants. So, the biggest discount available on a room usually comes with a pay in advance' method. The next option is a reserve now pay later' rates which cost slightly more. He adds: Room only options will always seem the cheapest but in terms of value for money the most expensive especially if you later choose to bolt on a breakfast and dinner. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
Aimee Robinson,2/24/2020,express,Coronavirus travel warning: FCO warns Britons of virus spread as country goes into lockdow,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1246459/Coronavirus-fco-travel-warning-italy-milan-venice-is-it-safe," Coronavirus has swept the globe, with confirmed cases in 35 countries. However, Italy has seen a rapid surge in cases, with over 200 suffers and seven fatalities over the weekend and the course of this morning. Panic has risen amongst holidaymakers jetting off to the country, with reports of a grounded plane at Heathrow as passengers grew fearful of flying to the infected region. Meanwhile, Italian authorities have placed parts of the country on lockdown, instilling heavy-handed prosecutions for anyone who tries to leave or enter certain virus hotspots. Various municipalities in the northern part of the country have been barricaded off from the rest of Italy, with officials suggesting anyone defying the restrictions could face up to three months in jail and a fine. The mayor of Milan has closed all universities and schools for the next week, despite the fact the city is not officially in lockdown. READ MORE:Heathrow Airport: Plane delayed as passenger panics over coronavirus   Venice is taking extensive measures to lockdown the tourist city in a bid to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, including cancelling its famous carnival visited by 200,000 people. An emergency meeting was held last night and another is to take place today to decide what to do about continued access to the city, given its ""extraordinary"" travel arrangements. Museums and schools have been immediately closed and a plan is to swing into action to disinfect gondolas and other public transport. A statement issued by the council said: ""A meeting was held with all the mayors of the Metropolitan City of Venice, the director Giuseppe Dal Ben and the managers of the investee companies Actv / Avm, Ames and Veritas. We work in close synergy with the Prefecture, the Veneto Region, the National Department of Civil Protection and the Government to take coordinated measures with the order just issued by the Minister of Health and the President of the Region and with the Prime Minister's Decree released today.

As regards the sanitisation of public transport, an extraordinary disinfection of all means, both land and water, of the Actv / Avm group had already been arranged on Sunday. On Monday, the Administration will issue a provision that takes into account the peculiarities of the municipal area. From midnight onwards, all the Carnival animations foreseen in the official programme and all the events of the Citta in Festa calendar until the end of next week will also be cancelled."" The FCO has issued updated travel advice on its websites for Britons, offering advice for those who are unsure about their safety when travelling. A statement on its website reads: There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China and elsewhere, including Italy. The government of Italy has introduced extraordinary measures that allow regions to implement civil protection measures in response to Coronavirus. This includes the isolation of 10 small towns in Lombardy and 1 in Veneto. The regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte and Emilia Romagna have implemented measures including the suspension of public or private events, the suspension of schools and higher education and the suspension on the opening of museums and cultural institutions for seven days. If you are already in the regions affected you should follow the instructions of local authorities.  A flight headed to Italy reportedly remained on the ground at Heathrow earlier this morning after panic erupted throughout the cabin. The aircraft, destined for Milan, was delayed after some passengers decided they no longer wanted to travel, NBC Foreign Correspondent Molly Hunter. She tweeted: At #Heathrow, our BA #Milan flight is delayed - the captain just announced there are passengers (I count 3) on board who don't want to travel due to #coronavirus. Already pushed back... now re-attaching. Express.co.uk contacted Heathrow airport for comment on the situation but has not yet received a response. However, even despite the developing situation in Europe, the World Health Organisation says that travellers should not avoid plans, and have offered insight into methods of protection.  Appearing on a Coronavirus update video, Dr Carmen Dolea, Head, IHR Secretariat at the World Health Organisation said: If you have to travel you have to go to the airport. They recommend washing hands frequently with soap and water and carrying an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Speaking to Express.co.uk, Dr Richard Dawood, a Travel Medicine Specialist from The Fleet Street Clinic, also urged travellers not to cancel holiday plans and instead says exercising good hygiene practices. Dr Dawood adds that travellers should maintain a social distance of at least 1 metre where possible. He added: Do make sure you have good insurance cover that could kick in at short notice if government advice changes. Keep a careful watch on the FCO, PHE and TravelHealthPro websites for the latest information on risks and restrictions. At the time of writing, there are currently 79,565 confirmed cases globally, with the death rate surpassing 2,600.

Aimee Robinson,2/24/2020,express,Pound to euro exchange rate: GBP sees little gain - focus on coronavirus and EU talks,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1246428/pound-euro-exchange-rate-sterling-gbp-coronavirus-brexit-travel-money-latest," The pound to euro exchange rate saw little major movement over the weekend following Friday's PMI results. Last week started on a high with sterling rocketing to a post-election high, however, it struggled to make any further gains as the week continued.  With Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushing ahead in the coming months with further UK-EU talks, all eyes will remain on political relations to determine which way the GBP will move. The pound is currently trading at a rate of 1.1976, showing a modest increase of 0.23 percent since the days opening. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Michael Brown, currency expert at Caxton FX, said: Sterling flatlined into the weekend on Friday, with the latest PMI surveys failing to give the pound any direction. This week, with the data calendar barren, investors will continue to monitor UK-EU relations before trade talks kick off next month. Friday's flash PMI figures showed some reflection of the coronavirus' effect on the global economy. READ MORE: Pound to euro exchange rate: Sterling struggles'   The epidemic began in China last month and has since spread globally. Certain sectors have felt the impact more than others, with the travel and tourism industry, in particular, feeling the hit. With travellers growing concerned about heading to areas where the virus rages on, countries such as Hong Kong have seen a major decrease in hotel stays. The hospitality sector has seen the number of tourists arriving drop to a daily average of 3,000 compared with 20,000 for the same month last year. DON'T MISSDo you need a visa to go to Turkey?

Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hong Kong has hit 65, with the death toll rising to two. In the UK there have been a total of 13 confirmed cases so far. With so much global turbulence, it can be difficult to predict which way the exchange rate will move next, which can be concerning for Britons heading on European getaways.  The Post Office is currently offering a rate of β‚¬1.1496 for Β£400 or more, or a rate of β‚¬1.1722 for Β£1,000 or more. Holidaymakers are advised to keep an eye on any relevant political or news updates which could see the rate rising or falling. However, when the rate is good, travellers should consider locking it in with a travel money card. Working in a similar way to a debit card, a travel money card will maintain the exchange rate of the day it was purchased.   Holidaymakers simply load a set amount onto their card and then can use it to spend in store or withdraw cash at an ATM. Travel money provider WeSwap suggests that these travel money cards are a much more financially beneficial alternative to using your regular plastic on holiday. A spokesperson explained: With UK debit cards deducting up to around 3 percent in non-sterling transaction fees, in addition to 2 percent overseas ATM fee based on the amount you take out, once totalled up, we're charged at a conservative estimate a colossal Β£125,000,000 in ATM fees abroad. Meanwhile, travel money cards tend to avoid these excessive fees for withdrawals or spending, meaning more holiday money to enjoy.

Aimee Robinson,2/24/2020,express,Holidays 2020: Britons willing to cancel travel plans as coronavirus spreads globally,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1246581/Holidays-2020-coronavirus-travel-cancel-latest," Coronavirus has the world in its grip as the virus has surpassed the Chinese borders, where it was discovered, and now been confirmed in 35 countries worldwide. As the number of infected rockets, British travellers have admitted they would consider cancelling their planned travel in a bid to avoid coming into contact with the sick. According to a new body of research by Retail Economics, just under a third of consumers said they are prepared to cancel holiday plans abroad if the coronavirus persists. Not only could this ruin spring and summer holiday plans, but it could also serve a mighty blow to the already suffering travel industry. In fact, around Β£17.2 billion worth of holiday spending would be taken from the sector as consumers await greater clarity over the severity of the illness. Retail Economics also points out the confusion many Britons seem to feel surrounding Covid-2019. READ MORE: FCO travel warning: Is Italy safe as coronavirus spreads?   Around a quarter of consumers say they believe the coronavirus is a high threat to health in the UK, meanwhile 35 percent think it's a moderate threat, and 42 percent deem it a low threat. In the UK there are now 13 confirmed cases of the disease. Concerned travellers revealed that they are now five times more likely to avoid travelling abroad in a bid to protect themselves from contracting the disease. Based on the study's response, and with the average UK household spending around Β£2,200 on holidays abroad per year according to the ONS, Retail Economics say the coronavirus could cost the industry around Β£17 billion.

[INSIGHT] The experts suggest that should the virus persist, other sectors such as retail and leisure could be impacted. The report states: There could be a near three-fold increase in the number of consumers that avoid shopping destinations (six percent currently avoid shopping destinations to protect themselves from the virus, compared to 16 percent who would consider it if the virus persists), while those who avoid restaurants and entertainment such as the cinema could almost double. On the other hand, this could have a positive impact for domestic holidays within the UK, trickling down into retail boosts. Retail Economics chief executive Richard Lim notes that: If the virus persists, consumers are likely to cut back in three main areas: holidays and travel, eating out, and using public transport.  Consumers will shift this spending elsewhere as they substitute what they would have spent abroad to other areas of the economy. The disease began in Wuhan, China, but rapidly spread beyond Asia to the rest of the world. In a bid to slow the spread many airlines have stopped travelling to China, and reduced flights to nearby infected region Hong Kong. Despite this, the disease has made its way into Europe, with Italy the latest country to see a sudden surge in virus suffers. There are currently over 200 confirmed cases in Italy, with five deaths, all of which have occurred since last Friday. Certain municipalities in Italy have now gone into lockdown, but there is no knowing what the future holds.  Surprisingly, though, the world health organisation urge travellers to push ahead with their plans. They say washing your hands and carrying hand sanitiser is enough. The health organisation also suggest that medical masks are not preventative for non-sufferers. Appearing on a Coronavirus update video, Dr Carmen Dolea, Head, IHR Secretariat at the World Health Organisation said: The masks are very effective for protecting people that are sick, for preventing them to transmit the virus onward. For people that are not sick masks are not very effective. It is almost important to ensure that you are using the masks properly and make sure not to touch the exterior of the mask even if you are not sick. The masks are also important for people that are caring for sick people. It will be important that people who most need the masks have access. She adds: If you have to travel you have to go to the airport. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
Al Root,2/24/2020,marketwatch,These Industrial Stocks Are Riding Out the Coronavirus Storm,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/these-industrial-stocks-are-riding-out-the-coronavirus-storm-51582575307,"It's a rough Monday for U.S. investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points , or 3.5%, at its nadir, and was off 2.7% in late afternoon trading. The S&P 500 was down 2.9% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8%. News the coronavirus is spreading outside of China has sent most shares into a tailspin . Investors looking for haven assets to reduce the volatility of their portfolios can consider the usual suspects, such as gold. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miner ETF (ticker: GDX), for instance, is up 1.1% Monday. But a few industrial sectors are outperforming the market and their better-than-average performance versus other industrial stocks should continue as long as the market is frightened by the virus. Aerospace and defense stocks offer one port in the storm.  Submarine maker Huntington Ingalls Industries (ticker: HII), for instance, is flat. Lockheed Martin (LMT) is off 1.5% and Honeywell (HON) is down 2%. Down isn't great, but aerospace and defense is doing a lot better than the S&P 500. The sector trades for about 16 times estimated 2020 earnings, a small discount to the broader market. Defense spending  depends on factors like politics and global conflict, so it tends to move independently of the economy. Waste collection is also doing well. The waste industry, like defense, tends to be uncorrelated with the rest of the economy. The amount of garbage generated tends to depend on factors like how many new households are established and how much consumers are spending. And there isn't any large foreign exposure with companies such as Waste Management (WM) or Republic Services (RSG). Those two stocks are both off 0.4%. The waste industry, however, doesn't trade at a discount like the aerospace and  defense group. Stock in waste haulers trades for about 30 times per-share earnings, on average, in line with industry history. Investors have valued the industry's stability and low correlation with other segments of the economy. The industrial stocks hardest hit are easy to predict. Travel-linked stocks, such as airlines, are taking it on the chin. (Airlines, including Delta Air Lines (DAL), for what its worth, are included in the industrial portion of the S&P 500.) FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) are also down a lot, by 4.8% and 4.3%, respectively. Both shares, to some extent, are dependent on the volume of global trade, which is currently threatened by the virus. Investors can choose to wait out the turmoil or take significant exposure off the table, sitting in gold, cash, or U.S. government bonds. Others can consider reallocating their money within industries to reduce volatility while staying invested so that they can benefit when the market eventually turns around. Industrial stocks aren't a perfect haven. The sector is heavily influenced by the state of the global economy. In fact, every single industrial stock in the S&P is down for the day. Not great, but down on a day like Monday, it isn't very significant.  Only about 20 stocks in the S&P and one stock in the Dow were up in late afternoon trading. ”Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com",business

Italy now reports 150 cases and three deaths attributed to the virus. The Borsa Italiana is plummeting, down 4.8% in overseas trading. Other overseas stock exchanges are in the red as well. The U.K's FTSE 100 Index has fallen 3.5%.
      Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is off 1.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 2.4%, or more than 700 points, while S&P 500 futures dropped 2.4%. Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite , off 3.2%, are being hit hardest. Investors appear worried about the impact the virus can have on semiconductor-supply chains. The bulk of the world's microchips are made in Asia. Stock in Lam Research (ticker: LCRX), for instance, is down 8.1% in premarket trading. Stock in travel-linked companies are getting hit too. Cruise operators Carnival (ticker: CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) shares are down 6.5% and 4.3%, respectively. United Airlines (UAL) shares are off 3.4%. Haven assets and health-care stocks are rising. Stock in gold miner Newmont (ticker: NEM) is up 3.7% in premarket trading. Biotechnology company Gilead Sciences (GILD) has risen 2.7%. And shares of Lakeland Industries (LAKE), a maker of personal protective equipment, have jumped 13.2%. It's difficult to separate the effects of the disease from the impact of other events, but shares of a few companies are moving for reasons that are clearly not virus-related. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) released fourth-quarter earnings Saturday that missed Wall Street's expectations. Shares are down 5.2% in premarket trading. Warren Buffett's company continues to sit on a cash pile of more than $120 billion. Investors are anxious to see Berkshire use its assets more aggressively. Berkshire shares underperformed the U.S. stock market recently, but its history of returns under the leadership of Buffett and Charlie Munger is remarkable. A thousand dollars invested in 1965 would be worth more than $27 million in 2020. The comparable number for the S&P 500 is about $200,000. Boeing (BA) shares are down more than $10, or 3.1%. The Wall Street Journal reported the company will offer financial support to suppliers affected by the halt to production of the company's 737 MAX jet, which has been grounded worldwide for almost a year due to safety concerns. Boeing believes it can bring the MAX back into commercial service by mid-2020.

Al Root,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Dow Jones Industrial Avearge Had Its Third-Worst Point Drop Ever. Don't Panic.,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/dow-jones-industrial-avearge-had-its-third-worst-point-drop-ever-dont-panic-51582584326,"Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 1,000 points on Monday. Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 1,000 points for just the third time in its long history. Investors shouldn't care about the points though. The percentage drop, while painful, shows this is far from a market panic . Monday, of course, was a bad day for U.S. investors. There is no ducking that fact. The spread of the coronavirus outside of China spooked all investors . Europe's FTSE 100 Index dropped 3.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.8%. The Dow dropped 3.6%. The S&P 500 fell 3.4%. And the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.7%. The Dow's 1,032 point decline was the third-largest point drop ever. That sounds ominous, but it isn't all that bad, historically speaking. The prior two 1,000-plus point declines occurred in the same month: February 2018. If fact, half of all the top-10 point declines occurred in 2018. That was a bad year for the Dow, but it wasn't a disaster. The index's 30 component stocks lost investors about 4% that year. The large daily declines experienced early in 2018, however, didn't end up derailing the long-running U.S. bull market. The Dow dropped by a little more than 4% in February 2018. That large monthly decline still left the Dow up year-to-date entering March. That's the good news. There is bad news too. Monday's 3.6% decline is in the worst 1% in the 30,000-or-so-days history of the Dow. It's a bad day and caused a lot of pain for a lot of investors. Still, Monday doesn't come anywhere close to the top-10 largest percentage declines. A drop of more than 8% is required to make that list. Eight of the top-10 largest percentage declines occurred before the end of 1932. The only modern trading sessions to crack the top 10 were around Black Monday ”Oct. 19, 1987. The Dow fell an incredible 22.6% on Black Monday. The index also declined 8% a week later, on Oct. 26. Point drops make headlines, but percentage drops are what investors focus on. Looking ahead , the ability to contain and control the spread of the virus will determine the near-term direction of the Dow. First- and second-quarter economic activity will likely be impacted by the virus. China, the world's second-largest economy, isn't close to running at 100%. That will hurt corporate earnings world-wide. But economic activity should bounce back, as long as the virus spread can be controlled. Containment isn't a forecast. It's a hope. And that's what all investors, and health-care professionals, would like to see. Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com",business
Alex Scroxton,2/24/2020,computerweekly,Cisco goes all-in on security integration with SecureX platform,https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252479013/Cisco-goes-all-in-on-security-integration-with-SecureX-platform,"Speaking to a growing supply-side conviction that the future of cyber security will prioritise product and service integration , simplification and interoperability, Cisco has unveiled a cloud-native security platform, unifying visibility across its portfolio and user infrastructure, enabling automated security workflows, and incorporating managed threat-hunting capabilities. GPT.display('halfpage') GPT.display('mu-1') The SecureX platform was unveiled at RSA Conference 2020 in San Francisco “ which is going ahead despite multiple suppliers, including AT&T and IBM, pulling out owing to coronavirus fears “ and Cisco believes it will radically simplify how chief information security officers (CISOs) go about their day-to-day work, with what it claims is the broadest, most integrated cloud-native security platform in existence. John Maynard, Cisco chief security officer, told Computer Weekly that the supplier was finally reaching the end of a path it has been walking since it started investing seriously in security acquisitions in the mid-2000s. We're trying to solve the number one problem that every CISO has “ that these environments have been built to be highly fragmented, he said. The vast majority of customers have a multi-vendor security estate, and struggle with orchestrating alerts and driving remediation at scale across that fragmented landscape. We see customers with up to 100 different vendors in their environment. Just being able to orchestrate across that is such a challenge, and frankly because of this a lot of this tech is not implemented or adopted, it's just sitting on a shelf, or it's in the environment but it's not properly configured or optimised, so not actually doing the job it's supposed to be doing. Cisco's 2020 CISO benchmark study “ which surveyed nearly 3,000 security professionals “ found that 28% felt managing a multi-supplier security environment was very challenging, up 8% since the 2019 survey. Meanwhile, 42% of CISOs said they were suffering from what Cisco termed  cyber fatigue , defined as basically giving up on proactively defending against threats and malicious actors. Of this group, 96% said multi-supplier environments were a headache. Maynard said the security industry was guilty of forcing the problem of integrating multi-supplier environments onto its customers, leaving them to stitch everything together using supplier-provided application programming interfaces (APIs). We're trying to solve the number one problem that every CISO has “ that [security] environments have been built to be highly fragmented. The vast majority of customers have a multi-vendor security estate, and struggle with orchestrating alerts and driving remediation at scale across that fragmented landscape John Maynard, Cisco Nearly one-third of organisations base cyber security monitoring and protection on more than 50 different security products. This not only adds cost and complexity, but also makes it harder to detect and respond to cyber security incidents in a timely fashion, said Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst and fellow at the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG). Integrated cyber security technology platforms like Cisco SecureX have the potential to address these economic, technical and resource challenges by providing more comprehensive threat detection, automated incident response and ease-of-operations capabilities. The fully cloud-native and multi-tenant SecureX platform will provide unified visibility across security environments “ including to third-party products “ bringing metrics, activity feeds and product information.",automotive
Alex Wilhelm,2/24/2020,techcrunch,"Coronavirus fears hit markets, bringing US shares down as tech and SaaS slip",https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/coronavirus-fears-hit-markets-bringing-us-shares-down-as-tech-and-saas-slip/,"Fears over the potential impact of the coronavirus spreading in Europe, Asia and the Middle East have sent stocks plummeting in Monday's open ” with tech stocks among the hardest hit. The reason for the declines are clear: Over the weekend, cases outside of China swiftly rose in Europe and other parts of Asia, indicating that hopes of containing the virus' spread appear to be dashed. This widening contagion has rattled markets as investors weight the potential for a global epidemic and grapple with its effects on the economy. Economists expect China to release key indicators about the strength of its economy later this week and the news does not look good. Chinese president Xi Jinping said over the weekend that the coronavirus had a relatively big impact on the economy and society, according to a report in The Guardian. Xi said that the government was already taking steps to minimize the damage to businesses around the country. Meanwhile, in Europe, International Monetary Fund chief Kirstalina Georgieva said that the global lender was ready to step in to lessen the blow emerging market economies may face from the virus. Global cooperation is essential to the containment of the Covid-19 and its economic impact, particularly if the outbreak turns out to be more persistent and widespread, Georgieva was quoted as saying in the Guardian.  Talking cybersecurity, SaaS and early-stage valuations with ForgePoint Capital  Those warnings rattled U.S. stock markets, which, as of the Dow's opening, had fallen significantly. Here's your Monday morning list of major index punishment at the open:  Dow Jones Industrial Index: -2.92% or 846.17 points S&P 500: -2.73% or -91.18 points Nasdaq: -3.57% or -336.69 points  Narrowing in a bit into the tech world, our favorite SaaS and cloud index is off 2.98%. (SaaS stocks are among the most highly-valued public shares in the market today; as such, they tend to trade at extremes to other equities, swinging higher and lower compared to other market movements. Notably, however, today they are changing less in value, which could be a bullish sign for the category.) If it's a stock, it's probably down today. And that's bad news for companies looking to either go public this year (Asana, Airbnb, and others) or report earnings this week (Square, HP, Box, Salesforce). No company likes to debut when the markets are falling, as it creates a harder milieu in which to price and can generate negative pressure on valuations that newly-public companies find unpalatable. For companies reporting earnings, markets in the throes of pessimism and fear don't make for receptive audiences. It's also more than just themarkets. Manufacturers that depend on China to deliver components are going to see shortages that could impact their ability to sell their goods and services in the short term. Factories in China were closed due to mass quarantines and those closures will ripple through the global economy. More if things change, but we're off to one heck of a bad start to the week.",tech
Andrea Riquier,2/24/2020,marketwatch,"Here's the segment of the economy that may benefit from fears of coronavirus, analysts say",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-segment-of-the-economy-that-may-benefit-from-fears-of-coronavirus-analysts-say-2020-02-15?mod=article_inline,"As the COVID-19 spreads and the patient count and death toll grow, economists are slashing their once-rosy expectations for global growth in 2020. But amid the anxiety, there's one bright spot in the U.S. that is likely to be immune from the virus fallout. Analysts say the housing market isn't just domestic in nature. It will also be buoyed by exceptionally cheap borrowing costs, years of pent-up demand, and a residential construction sector that may have finally figured out how to efficiently produce entry-level properties. Year after year, through things like the Greek debt crisis I had a theory that home buyers were going to be spooked, and they just shrugged off the news, said Glenn Kelman, CEO of home brokerage Redfin RDFN, +3.31% . The past few years have made a fool out of anyone predicting higher rates and challenging American exceptionalism. The U.S. economy just keeps on going strong.  The past few years have made a fool out of anyone predicting higher rates and challenging American exceptionalism. The U.S. economy just keeps on going strong.'  ” Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin Just how ferocious is demand in the housing market? On his first-quarter earnings call last week, Kelman had this to say: A Redfin agent just told us about a bidding war with 30 other buyers in a far-flung area outside of Portland, Ore., this month. The property being fought over was a mobile home. This situation can last longer than most realize, as the law of supply and demand works slowly in real estate. That is helping to extend what has long been a seasonal business, Kelman told MarketWatch. Anxious buyers are pushing the spring selling season earlier and earlier. Investors may start to get a read on that activity this week, which will bring the first housing economic releases of 2020. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will report the number of new homes started and permits applied for in January. On Friday, the National Association of Realtors will release data on January sales of previously-owned homes, which make up about 90% of the market. Kelman isn't the only observer who expects big things from housing this year. It will be a tailwind for the broader U.S. economy, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. For Zandi, the state of housing comes down to financing costs. If we have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4% or below, we should have a solid market, he said. If we have 3.5%, we have rip-roaring growth. North of 4%, the market will fade. A 1.60% benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note rate TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.710% , which was the average in the most recent week, is the sweet spot for the mortgage market, Zandi said. Kelman said that similar to other exogenous events that manage to at least momentarily surprise markets and keep yields in check, the outbreak of coronavirus may have the unintended consequence of keeping borrowing costs low. The coronavirus is sort of a dark irony helping out housing, Zandi told MarketWatch. It's keeping rates down as global investors come piling into the U.S. but it's not hurting our economy to the point where it's costing us jobs, he said. Related: Yes, Brexit will help you refi Zandi and others emphasize that it's still too soon to know anything about the true impact of the infectious disease, but as Kelman put it, the housing market won't turn down on a dime. Do I see any storm clouds on the horizon? I don't. But is it going to rain? I know it will, he told MarketWatch. And for now, Americans may be mostly oblivious about the angst swirling through financial markets. On Friday, a closely watched measure of consumer confidence roared past economist expectations to match a near-15-year high. Only 7% of survey respondents mentioned the coronavirus in early February. It's too early to know whether that means Americans aren't very aware of the situation - or that they are brushing it off. Still, as Kelman put it, the decision to buy a home is the most macro-sensitive purchase there is. Americans can put off clothing purchases or dine in rather than visit restaurants, but they know once they buy a home, they are making a 30-year commitment ” and yet are still out in force touring open houses. Builders may also finally start to make a solid contribution to economic growth: Zandi thinks this could be the first year in a decade in which analysts underestimate the pace of residential construction rather than overestimate it. It's taken a while, but builders have finally figured out how to make their costs pencil out at lower home purchase points, Zandi noted. Homeowners are also renovating and redecorating. In the government's January retail sales data , one of the bright spots was home centers: stores like Home Depot Inc . HD, -0.21% and Lowe's Cos . LOW, +1.28% (Both home-improvement retailers will report fourth-quarter earnings during the last week of February.) How can investors place bets on how it all shakes out? An exchange-traded fund that offers what it calls a way to play the housing shortage, the Hoya Capital Housing ETF HOMZ, +1.75% , has gained about 6.6% in the year to date, outperforming the S&P 500's SPX, +1.13% 4.6% rise and the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, +0.93% 3% year-to-date gain, but not the 8.5% return thus far for the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% . Meanwhile, markets closed mixed on Friday, but ended solidly higher for the week, with the Dow advancing 1%, the S&P 500 1.6%, and the Nasdaq 2.2% for the week.

Andrea Riquier,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Has the Great Moderation' returned ” and is that a good thing?,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/has-the-great-moderation-returned-and-is-that-a-good-thing-2020-02-06?mod=article_inline,"Have we returned to the Great Moderation? That was the question posed by Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, in a note out Wednesday. The Great Moderation is the name often given to the period from the mid-1980s to 2007, when the Federal Reserve kept inflation and economic growth relatively stable¦ until it all collapsed in spectacular fashion in the global financial crisis of 2008. While Ashworth's analysis examines whether the Moderation is back, it also asks another important question: is that good? First to the definition: The Great Moderation in the volatility of GDP growth and price inflation, which began in the 1980s, came to an abrupt end with the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 but, a decade later, what stands out again is just how stable economic growth and price pressures have been, Ashworth wrote. He pointed out that GDP growth and inflation aren't as volatile as they once were. Last year the 10-year standard deviations of both GDP growth and core PCE inflation reached record lows. Ashworth asked, The current expansion is already the longest on record and, with recent fears of an imminent recession fading , is it possible that boom and bust is a thing of the past? Aside from an external shock ” and Ashworth says it's still too early to count out the coronavirus epidemic” it is not obvious where a recession would come from “ at least in the next year or two. Recessions are often caused when the economy overheats and the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to rein in the excess activity. But the Fed right now is predisposed to be as dovish as possible, Ashworth noted ” and if President Donald Trump wins re-election, he's likely to nominate policymakers who are even more accommodating. Related: Inflation isn't coming and the Fed's job is about to get a lot harder, economist says One possibility, which is much on the minds of both Fed officials and many analysts, is that the loose financial conditions for over a decade since the financial crisis may create another bubble that bursts, just like the mid-2000s excesses in the housing market brought the financial market to its knees . With the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio at a record high, corporate bond spreads unusually low and equity valuations looking stretched, the usual suspects are already arguing that the bubbles are in place, Ashworth noted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.36% has climbed 347% and the S&P 500 SPX, +1.59% has gained 393% from their 2009 bear-market lows. Although we share some of those concerns, we would argue the current risks are still moderate rather than extreme. A bursting asset price or credit bubble may be responsible for the next recession, but probably not for another few years. It's worth noting that many observers take a more jaundiced view of the Great Moderation idea than Ashworth does, particularly the notion that financial markets that have been so tightly controlled for so long won't find some way to let off steam. Indeed, when the Federal Reserve rushed to calm the overnight financial markets in September, Washington analyst Karen Petrou had this to say: The Fed promised yet again to do what it takes' by way of an unlimited backstop to stabilize financial markets, Petrou said. Related: The financial and housing market rescue left many Americans behind Far worse, repo-market turmoil parts the curtain, revealing the imperial U.S. central bank to be a flummoxed Fed as unimpressive as the embarrassed Wizard of Oz. In the years before 2008, the Fed's flattering fiction was Greenspan's Great Moderation.' Since then, it's been what I'll call the Great Stability ” that is, safer banks mean safer markets. Both illusions pleased internal Fed expectations of perfect objectivity backed by awesome analytical prowess. Their demise proves that central planning done by central banks is no less dangerous than any other kind of central plan. In order to keep financial markets placated, the Fed opened the credit spigots this past fall, and has pledged to keep liquidity flowing. That may swell the central bank's balance sheet to nearly the same size it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In contrast to that view, Goldman Sachs economists wrote in early 2019 that one of the key arguments for the persistence of the Great Moderation was that structural changes to the economy in recent decades simply make it less prone to recession. One example Ashworth cites in his recent note is that the maturing U.S. energy industry makes the country less dependent on foreign oil and thus less bothered by supply shocks. While this view took a serious hit in the crisis and the subsequent deep recession, we think many aspects of the Great Moderation are still intact, and some have even strengthened, the Goldman team wrote. What to think? Ashworth sums up his thinking this way: There is a good chance the current expansion will continue for at least another few years, with the volatility of GDP growth and core inflation remaining unusually low. But that doesn't mean boom and bust is a thing of the past. As ex-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan warned in 2005, history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums.' See: Bond yields can't stay low forever, Dudley says.

Andrew Bary,2/24/2020,marketwatch,"Warren Buffett on Berkshire Hathaway's Stock Buybacks, Apple, Bitcoin, and More",https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaways-stock-buyback-problem-51582552972,"Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Photograph by Drew Angerer/Getty Images Many Berkshire Hathaway investors would like the conglomerate to buy back more stock, but not enough of them are willing to sell large chunks of shares, according to CEO Warren Buffett. It's very hard to buy blocks in the market, Buffett said in a wide-ranging CNBC interview that included an endorsement of Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) and touched on Monday's market sell-off, among other issues. It's held by people that really plan to keep it, Buffett said of Berkshire shares (BRK.B). The stock is less liquid than the shares of many big companies due to the presence of many long-term holders. Some have owned the stock for decades, capturing spectacular returns, but Buffett also reiterated Monday that the conglomerate's vast size means it isn't likely to beat the market by much in coming years. Berkshire last year bought back nearly $5 billion of stock under expanded authority that Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger received in 2018. The 2019 purchases were more than the $1.4 billion in 2018, but accounted for less than 1% of Berkshire shares outstanding. Some Berkshire fans would like to see repurchases of 2% to 3%. Buffett said a great majority of companies can repurchase 4% to 5% of their shares without disturbing the market. Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter , released on Saturday, that the Berkshire price/value equation was modestly favorable at times during 2019. That was hardly the ringing endorsement of the stock that some Berkshire fans had hoped to see. Buffett noted in the letter that potential sellers of $20 million or more of Berkshire stock should contact the company only if you are ready to sell. The advertisement for potential sellers reflects the difficulty that Berkshire faces in repurchasing large blocks of stock. Buffett said that Berkshire would consider buying such blocks if Berkshire is in the market buying stock. Separately, Buffett said that a Berkshire purchase of 2% of Kroger stock, made by the conglomerate during the fourth quarter, was a call by one of his investment lieutenants, and not by him. The recent disclosure of the purchase helped lift Kroger shares. Kroger is doing a good job but it's in a tough business, Buffett said, noting the presence of Amazon.com (AMZN), Costco Wholesale (COST) and Walmart (WMT) in the industry. Buffett said the Kroger purchase came from one of our managers, either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who each run about $15 billion of Berkshire's equity portfolio totaling about $250 billion. He didn't say which manager bought the stock. On Apple, Buffett said the maker of the iPhone is an incredible company and I should have appreciated it earlier. Berkshire accumulated the bulk of its holding from 2016 to 2018 and now owns more than 5% of Apple, a holding that is worth over $75 billion. Berkshire has doubled its money in Apple so far, making it one of the company's best investments ever. He called it a consumer products company that uses technology, selling an incredibly useful product, the smartphone, that is vital to hundreds of millions of people. Buffett, long a technophobe, said he now owns a new Apple smart phone and has given up his old flip phone. He didn't mention the Apple model he owns. Buffett isn't enamored of Treasuries, arguing that yields are too low relative to inflation. Buffett said it makes no sense for investors to lend money to the federal government at 1.4% for 10 years when the government policy is to have 2% inflation. He added that you give them money at 1.4%, they tax you on it (the interest income) and devalue that money at 2%. Buffett added that the 10-year Treasury amounts to a stock trading for 70 times earnings whose earnings won't go up for 10 years. (A stock trading for 20 times earnings would have an earnings yield of 5%, so a yield of 1.4% is equivalent to a price/earnings multiple of 70.) He sees no appeal in such an investment proposition, and Berkshire holds relatively few bonds. It had less than $19 billion at year-end 2019, compared with $128 billion of cash and equivalents and $250 billion or so of stocks. Much of Berkshire's bond portfolio is from overseas issuers. Buffett said that he and Munger are mystified by the $13 trillion of negative-yielding debt in the world, much of it in Europe and Japan. We do not understand at all what the outcome will be when there is $13 trillion borrowed at less than zero. He is also puzzled by the huge federal deficit, now running at 4.5% of gross domestic product and no one is concerned in the least. Buffett said his negative views on bitcoin haven't changed following a lunch with a crypto-currency enthusiast who paid $4.6 million to a charity last year for the opportunity. Crypto-currencies basically have no value and don't produce anything, Buffett said. You have to hope that somebody pays you more for it later. He added that he owns no crypto-currencies and never will. He joked that he might start a Warren currency and issue 21 million of them, like bitcoin. Buffett said he isn't fazed by the coronavirus and the market selloff on Monday. It makes no difference on our investments, he said. There's always some good news and bad news. Buffett didn't say whether Berkshire is in the market buying stocks, but added we're certainly more inclined to buy stocks today than Friday. In a final key point, Buffett said Berkshire's edge over the S&P 500 will be minor in the future given the company's huge size. The  company is valued at about $540 billion and ranks sixth in the U.S. stock market. He emphasized the company's safety, given its strong balance sheet and diversified earnings base. Berkshire earned $24 billion after taxes from operations in 2019. Berkshire stock has trailed the S&P 500 over the past one, five and 10 years. That has led to some frustration among Berkshire investors. Buffett noted that Berkshire has the highest net worth of any company in the world. I feel good about the fact that 99% of my money's in it and that it will be the source of all the philanthropic contributions that are made for 15 or a dozen years after I die. So”but I don't think”I do not think it will be in the top 10% of stocks performing over the next 10 years. I don't think it'll be in the top 15% of stocks performing in the next 10 or 15 years. I also don't think it'll be in the bottom 10% or 20% or 30%. So, but our ability to have a huge edge over the market generally with a $550 billion market value, it's just, it'll be minor, but it'll be done in a very, very safe manner, Buffett said.

The company has canceled a series of matches that were set to take place in South Korea between February 29th and March 22nd in order to protect the health and safety of our players, fans, and staff. This includes a number of makeup matches that were moved to Korea following the cancellation of games in China as well as home games to be hosted by the Seoul Dynasty at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza on March 7th and 8th. We are working with the league on rescheduling these matches and will share more information through the league when it is available, the Dynasty said in a statement. Dynasty parent company Gen.G Esports previously said that it would be donating 100 percent of the proceeds from the event, along with merchandise sales through March, to coronavirus-related charities. Last month, Blizzard announced that it canceled all OWL games in China that were slated for February and March. Related The Overwatch League is currently in the midst of its third season, and it's a vital one for the league's future. It's the first season in which each of the league's 20 teams is slated to host matches in their particular city; OWL features teams in six different countries and three continents. Asia is a particularly important market for the league, with four teams based in China and many star players hailing from South Korea. It wasn't [a decision] we took lightly, Jon Spector, VP of business operations and product strategy for Overwatch esports, told The Verge earlier this month. We've been excited about playing those matches in China for years, the fans and the players are excited about it. But we never had a single discussion where player safety didn't come first. Three weeks in, all league games have been hosted by American teams, most recently the Washington Justice this past weekend. Of course, OWL is far from the only venture impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, and that includes several other notable esports events. The Chinese League of Legends Pro League suspended play just a week into the 2020 season, and it currently plans to kick off an online practice competition starting February 26th. Meanwhile, League of Legends Champions Korea is still playing matches but without spectators, and the King Pro League ” a Chinese league for the popular mobile game Honor of Kings / Arena of Valor ” will be played online instead of in studios and arenas.",tech
Annalisa Merelli,2/24/2020,qz,Hysteria over coronavirus in Italy reminiscent of the black death ” Quartz,https://qz.com/1807049/hysteria-over-coronavirus-in-italy-is-reminiscent-of-the-black-death/,"The largest European outbreak of coronavirus is now in Italy, where it has infected more than 150 people, andΒ  killed six. In response, the government has quarantined 11 towns, shuttered schools, called off football games, and advised citizens to avoid leaving home altogether. Frantic citizens preparing for the worst have emptied grocery stores. Alarm over the disease is fueling hysteria and discrimination. A panicked search for the so-called patient zero”the first to bring the virus into the country”is being described by the Italian media as a hunt. Briefly authorities thought they identified the culprit, a man who had recently traveled to China. But all tests on him turned out negative. Chinese and Asian communities have been targeted by boycotts, threats, and even violent attacks. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the country's far-right political party, called for an end to all travel between Italy and China. And then, in a non sequitur, also called for closing harbors to migrants from African countries too. Prejudice against Chinese communities is a problem the world over. In the United States, for instance, residents are avoiding restaurants in the Chinatowns of major cities. But Italy is especially fertile ground for this kind of racism, and the way people are reacting to the epidemic brings to mind an episode of Italian history from hundreds of years ago, in the very same areas that are now on lockdown: the plague. At the turn of the 17th century, the plague tore across Italy. And nowhere was the hysteria more hysterical than in Milan, mostly due to an old conspiracy theory dating back to the the 1300s that nefarious people deliberately spread disease through ointments and powders they would surreptitiously spread on people, doors, and walls. These people were called untori, which can be roughly translated as anointers, and they were targeted by mobs. While there was no truth to it, the accusation was a powerful one: The first to be targeted in the mid-14th century were Jewish communities. Europeans accused Jews of trying to kill all Christians in Europe by spreading the disease. Not even a proclamation by the Pope that Jewish people were not to blame managed to stop the attacks. Less than two centuries later, the plague reached Milan. Erroneous bulletins and proclamations (the fake news of the time)Β spread rumors that people were going around with vials filled with plague-spreading oils. Accusing someone of being an untore became a powerful weapon against a personal enemy. The call to beat up an untore, Dagli! All'untore! became so ubiquitous it is still used in common Italian parlance to attack someone for an invented reason. This is a time Italians should be familiar with, as it is chronicled in a famous novel, Alessandro Manzoni's 1828 I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed, link in Italian), which is a cornerstone of Italian literature”and a mainstay of the Italian school curriculum. In that novel, as well as in his 1840 essay Storia della Colonna Infame (The story of the infamous column), Manzoni writes about the collective hysteria that took hold during the time of the plague. It appears the Italians who are taught this history are now doomed to repeat it. Much like the Jewish communities of the 14th century and the imagined utore of 17th, Asians in Italy are now the target of discrimination and attack in the 21st. And so Manzoni's wordsΒ ring true yet again: Suspicion andΒ  exasperation, when they aren't stopped by reason and charity, have the sad characteristic of making people think that the least lucky are culprits, on the basis of the vaguest hints and most thoughtless claims, he wrote.",tech

Look to history,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/past-disease-outbreaks-show-investors-shoud-ignore-the-noise-of-coronavirus.html,"Global markets are suffering. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply. Don't hit the panic button just yet. Within six months, stocks are usually on the mend from the fallout of disease outbreaks such as the coronavirus, say experts. These declines aren't the first caused by the respiratory illness that was initially reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, and has since infected more than 79,000 people. Economist Patrick Perret-Green said late last month that the outbreak threatened a ""Lehman-type moment"" but then stocks rebounded by early February. ""They recovered all of those losses “ and then some,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. Kleintop compiled research recently on how long stocks felt the pain of endemics and pandemics. Not too long, it turns out.  Stocks were down 2% in the immediate wake of a 2010 cholera outbreak, which eventually sickened more than 6% of Haitians. Six months later? They were up more than 13%. In 2016, the Zika virus, linked to birth defects in the babies of mothers infected while pregnant, tore through Latin America, the Caribbean and the U.S. The global stock market shed 6% a month after Zika took off. But six months later? It was down just around 0.6%. The deadly Ebola virus that broke out two years later dragged global stocks down more than 7%. Just half a year later, much of that decline had been reversed, too. ""On a forward-looking basis, dengue fever, swine flu, Ebola, measles, rubella, Zika, they don't hurt the stock market that much,"" said Dan Egan, managing director of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment.  Some patterns of the past are harder to learn from. As cases of swine flu rose in 2009, so did stocks.The coronavirus has triggered similarly nonsensical market movements. One day, investor responses are diagnosed as overblown, the next, muted. Your takeaway? ""Ignore the noise in the short-term,"" said Steve Wendel, head of behavioral science at Morningstar. And turn your attention to your own financial goals.

To be sure, staying calm amid a disease outbreak is not easy. ""It's a topic that feels closer to home and therefore has a more dramatic response in the market,"" Egan said. And of course, as the disclaimers remind us, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Nevertheless, it's good to know we've been here before and come out ahead.",finance

In many ways, China actually is setting a new standard for outbreak response, and it's not an exaggeration, he said. As the new disease, now called COVID-19, grew into a health crisis, Chinese officials had quarantined entire cities in a matter of days, suspended travel, closed schools and businesses, and imposed severe restrictions on who could leave their homes. Local researchers rapidly sequenced and shared the virus's genome, allowing labs around the world to work on their own diagnostic tools. Authorities built two new specialized hospitals in 10 days, footage of which China's state-owned media pumped out to the world on social media. They leveraged their formidable surveillance powers to scale up contact tracing, an essential measure in stopping an outbreak. President Donald Trump tweeted in praise of China's great discipline. Even after subsequent reports indicated that the Chinese government's secrecy and hostility to dissent had helped the outbreak spread, WHO officials have continued to laud Beijing's response. At a conference in Munich earlier this month, Michael Ryan, the executive director of the organization's Health Emergencies Programme, maintained that people in China feel protected. They feel like their government has stepped in aggressively and quickly to protect them, he said. That is the ultimate social contract between any government and its people.",general
Arjun Kharpal@ArjunKharpal,2/24/2020,cnbc,"Coronavirus: China to boost mass surveillance machine, experts say",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/coronavirus-china-to-boost-mass-surveillance-machine-experts-say.html,"China could use the coronavirus outbreak to boost its mass surveillance capabilities as it looks to technology to help contain the epidemic in the world's second-largest economy. The Communist Party has built a vast surveillance state through different methods with technology at its core. As artificial intelligence and the use of data becomes more advanced, Beijing has found increasingly effective ways to track the Chinese population, including facial recognition. China is trying to control the spread of the spread of the virus, believed to have first emerged from Wuhan city in Hubei province, which has already killed at least 2,500 people in the mainland. With over 77,000 coronavirus cases confirmed in China alone, the government has mobilized its surveillance machine, a move experts said could continue even after the virus has been contained. Beyond using facial recognition to track people, China is also utilizing novel methods based on existing technology. For example, Chinese state-backed publication Global Times posted a video on Twitter showing a drone with a camera telling people to wear masks.  The Chinese government has also enlisted the help of tech giants like Tencent, owner of popular messaging app WeChat and Alibaba subsidiary, Ant Financial, which runs payments app Alipay. On both WeChat and Alipay, users can put in their Chinese ID numbers and where they have travelled. Users will then be assigned a QR code based on a traffic light color system which instructs them about how long they need to be in quarantine, or whether they are free to travel. A QR code is a type of barcode which is widely used on digital platforms in China. These codes could be used to notify people in buildings about a person's recent movements, such as within office or apartment blocks. Mobile networks in China have also released tracking features. China Unicom and China Telecom -- both stated-owned telco operators ” are asking people to put in the last few digits of their ID or passport number, which will then be used to track a person's whereabouts. They will get messages outlining where they have been. Again, the feature could be used if a building has strict restriction on people entering who haven't been in quarantine for 14 days, which is the suggested amount of time by the government. And China's artificial intelligence giants have put out some new products too. Earlier this month, Megvii announced that it had deployed a temperature checking tool in Beijing. It can detect an abnormal body temperature and alert authorities who can then do a second check on the person. Sensetime, another Chinese AI firm, said it has developed an algorithm that can detect people not wearing masks in public. Chinese authorities have encouraged everyone to wear masks. While the Chinese government has used the coronavirus to justify the increased use of surveillance technology, experts said it could continue even after the virus is contained. Maya Wang, senior researcher on China at Human Rights Watch, pointed to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which ""gave the Chinese government, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party), and its mass surveillance agenda a further opportunity."" ""The Party has increasingly treated 'stability maintenance' ” a euphemism for social control ” as an overarching priority, and devoted enormous resources to security agencies for monitoring dissidents, breaking up protests, censoring the internet, and developing and implementing mass surveillance systems,"" she wrote in a recent paper. In comments to CNBC, she said something similar may happen with the new coronavirus as a justification. ""I think there are signs that the coronavirus outbreak, like these events above, serve as a catalyst and a boost for China's development in mass surveillance systems,"" Wang told CNBC. ""Once these systems are in place, those involved in its developments ” particularly companies with money to be made ” argue for their expansion or their wider use, a phenomenon known as 'mission creep.' What initially started as a system to crack down on crime ” which is already a dubious and vague enough justification to encompass political crimes in China ” is now used for other purposes including for fighting the coronavirus outbreak."" Nigel Inkster, senior advisor at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, also thinks the Chinese Communist Party will ""double down on existing techniques for social control and narrative management,"" using the virus outbreak as a way of sharpening its surveillance tools. ""To us this will seem like pathological learning, but to a regime focused above all on retaining power, it will appear logical,"" Inkster told CNBC. ""Once the dust has settled, reviews will be conducted and adjustments made. I don't think they will need more capabilities than what they already have but they will want to fine-tune them and work towards greater systems integration.""",finance
Associated Press,2/24/2020,marketwatch,"South Korea goes on high alert over virus, Italy battles to contain outbreak",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/south-korea-goes-on-high-alert-over-virus-italy-battles-to-contain-outbreak-2020-02-23?mod=article_inline,"SEOUL, South Korea  ” South Korea reported another large jump in new virus cases Monday a day after the the president called for unprecedented, powerful steps to combat the outbreak that is increasingly confounding attempts to stop the spread. The 161 new cases bring South Korea's total to 763 cases, and two more deaths raise its toll to seven. China also Monday reported 409 new cases, raising the mainland's total to 77,150 after a zigzag pattern of increases in recent days. The 150 new deaths from the COVID-19 illness raised China's total to 2,592 and showed a spike after hovering below 100 for four days. All but one death were in Hubei province, where the outbreak emerged in December. Significant jumps in cases outside China have raised concern of the outbreak getting out of control. South Korea has the third-highest national total behind China and Japan, and cases have rapidly increased in Italy and Iran in just a few days. Most of Japan's cases were from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where nearly one-fifth of its 3,711 passengers and crew became infected. More than 140 of South Korea's new cases were in and near the city of Daegu, where most of the country's infections have so far occurred. Six of the seven deaths were linked to a hospital in Cheongdo, near Daegu, where a slew of infections were confirmed among patients in a mental ward. While officials have expressed hope they could contain the outbreak to the region surrounding Daegu, some experts noted signs of the virus circulating nationwide, pointing to a number of cases in the capital, Seoul, and elsewhere that weren't immediately traceable. In Daegu, the number of new cases that are being confirmed by tests is quite large, and if we fail to effectively stem community transmissions in this area, there would be a large possibility (that the illness) spreads nationwide, South Korean Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said in a briefing, saying that the government aims to stabilize Daegu's situation in four weeks. He said that health officials plan to test all of the city's residents exhibiting cold-like symptoms, which he said would be about 28,000 people. Health workers are also screening some 9,000 followers of the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, where a woman in her 60s attended two services before testing positive for the virus. Of the country's 161 new cases, 129 were related to the church. Officials are also investigating a possible link between churchgoers and the spike in infections at a hospital in nearby Cheongdo. The national government has shuttered schools, cancelled events, and asked companies to scatter working hours and keep employees at home if they experience coughs or other respiratory symptoms. It advised people to avoid crowded indoor spaces and pleaded that those who recently visited Daegu or nearby areas stay at home if possible for two weeks, asking reporters to exercise the same caution. Seoul's Mayor Park Won-soon scattered the working hours of some 40,000 city employees to ease transit congestion and warned of sterner action against protesters who defied a ban on rallies in major downtown areas that was meant to stop the spread of the virus. Far from where the illness first emerged, authorities in Italy battled to contain Europe's first major outbreak and Iran reported eight deaths ” the highest toll outside of China. Some of the clusters in recent days have no link to China, a worrying sign of the virus spread. The Iranian health ministry has reported 43 cases since Wednesday and several countries reported cases connected to travel to Iran. Kuwait confirmed its first cases Monday in three people who had traveled from Iran, and Bahrain reported its first case, also a traveler returning from Iran. The United Arab Emirates said new cases there included Iranian tourists. A number of countries have closed their borders with Iran or effectively barred travelers from there, a similar step to the actions numerous countries have taken to ward off the spread of the illness from China. In Italy's northern Lombardy region, which includes the nation's financial capital, Milan, the governor announced Sunday that the number of confirmed cases stood at 110. Italy now has 152 cases, the largest number outside of Asia, including three deaths. Venice, which is full of tourists for Carnival events, reported its first two cases, said Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia, whose region includes the lagoon city. It wasn't immediately known if the two infected had participated in Carnival festivities. As Italy scrambled to check the spread of the virus, authorities announced that all Carnival events had been called off as well as major league soccer matches in the stricken region. Cinemas and theaters were also ordered shuttered, including Milan's legendary La Scala. Warning that China's virus epidemic is still grim and complex, President Xi Jinping called for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist Party's response as timely and effective in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Meanwhile, a diplomatic row erupted after Israel turned back a South Korean airliner, underscoring fear and tensions over the outbreak. A Korean Air flight with 188 passengers that landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Saturday evening was taxied away from the terminal while authorities allowed only 11 Israelis to enter the country. The plane returned to South Korea with the rest of the passengers on Sunday. Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was closely monitoring the incident and will evacuate South Korean tourists from Israel if necessary. Yonhap news agency cited South Korea's Foreign Ministry as registering a strong protest with the Israeli government. Israel's Foreign Ministry issued travel warnings to South Korea and Japan due to the coronavirus, and the Health Ministry ordered Israelis returning from those countries to remain in home quarantine, as previously ordered for those returning from Hong Kong, China, Macau, Thailand and Singapore.",business
Associated Press,2/24/2020,marketwatch,White House seeks $2.5 billion in emergency funds to fight coronavirus,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/white-house-prepares-budget-request-for-emergency-coronavirus-funds-2020-02-24?mod=article_inline,"WASHINGTON ” The White House on Monday sent lawmakers an urgent $2.5 billion plan to address the deadly coronavirus outbreak, whose rapid spread and threat to the global economy rocked financial markets. The White House budget office said the funds are for vaccines, treatment and protective equipment. The request was immediately slammed by Democrats as insufficient and came as coronavirus fears were credited with Monday's 1,000-plus point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and are increasingly seen as a potential political threat to President Donald Trump. The request was released Monday evening and came as key government accounts were running low. The Department of Health and Human Services had already tapped into an emergency infectious disease rapid response fund and was seeking to transfer more than $130 million from other HHS accounts to combat the virus but is pressing for more. Today, the Administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies, said White House budget office spokeswoman Rachel Semmel. We are also freeing up existing resources and allowing for greater flexibilities for response activities. The administration is requesting $1.25 billion in new funding and wants to transfer $535 million more in funding from an Ebola preparedness account that's been a top priority of Democrats. It anticipates shifting money from other HHS accounts and other agencies to complete the $2.5 billion response plan. Senators returning to Washington after a weeklong recess will receive a classified briefing Tuesday morning on the government's coronavirus response, a Senate aide said. A spokeswoman for Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the panel will take their input into account as we continue to do our due diligence to determine what additional resources are necessary. Democrats said the request was insufficient and that Trump's attempt to go after existing Ebola prevention funding was dead on arrival. All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic and the administration has no plan, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who blasted a shortage of kits to test for the virus and President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts to health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have a crisis of coronavirus and President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response. Trump was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's response to the 2014 Ebola scare, which barely touched the U.S. but was seen as a factor in that year's midterm elections, which restored control of the Senate to Republicans. Trump took to Twitter Monday to defend his record. The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! he tweeted. Among the needs is funding to reimburse the Pentagon, which is housing evacuees from China ” who are required to undergo 14-day quarantines ” at several military bases in California. Democrats controlling the House wrote HHS Secretary Alex Azar earlier this month to request funds to help speed development of a coronavirus vaccine, expand laboratory capacity, and beef up screening efforts at U.S. entry points. House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., called the plan woefully insufficient. Despite urgent warnings from Congress and the public health community, the Trump administration took weeks to request these emergency funds, Lowey said in a statement. Their answer now is to raid money Congress has designated for other critical public health priorities. Azar is slated to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, and the U.S. response to the outbreak is sure to be a major topic. The quickly spreading virus has slammed the economy of China, where the virus originated, and caseloads are rapidly increasing in countries such as South Korea, Iran, and Italy. Almost 80,000 people have contracted the disease, with more than 2,500 deaths, mostly in China. The United States, however, has had only 14 cases of the disease spread across seven states. In San Francisco, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a walking tour of Chinatown on Monday to let the public know the neighborhood is safe and open for business. Pelosi, a Democrat who represents the heavily Chinese American city, visited the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, whose owner Kevin Chan, says his business and others are down 70% since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Γ‡ome to Chinatown, Pelosi said. Precautions have been taken by our city, we know that there's concern about tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it's very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. In a statement Monday night, Pelosi called the president's request long overdue and completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency. She said the House would advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis.",business

Whole towns in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto have been put into lockdown in an attempt to keep the virus under control but officials in the country have so far failed to identify the source of the outbreak. Eerie footage filmed at the weekend in the Casalpusterlengo, Lombardy, area captured the terrifying atmosphere spreading in the region as roads appeared completely devoid of people amid the growing fear of infection. The Sky News drone footage shows two lonely cars travelling down a provincial road before moving closer to the centre of Casalpusterlengo, showing little to no one on the streets of the quarantined town. The majority of reported cases have been recorded in Lombardy, where 165 people are currently being monitored and three people have died. One man also died in the neighbouring Veneto region, where the second-highest number of cases, 22, is now quarantined. Nine more people have been taken to hospital in Piedmont, including an ambulance crew dispatched to test a suspected case “ who later turned out to be positive “ without the right protective gear. Schools, cinemas and gyms have been ordered to remain closed until March 2 while officials attempt to contain the outbreak of COVID-19. Venice also suspended all celebrations for the annual carnival.    Austria on Sunday evening temporarily suspended all train connections with Italy after two passengers of the Venice-Munich service were reported to be showing signs of coronavirus. Southern Italian region Basilicata announced all locals returning from northern Italy will be automatically placed under quarantine. Vito Bardi, the President of the Basilicata Region, said: ""All citizens returning to Basilicata from Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Liguria or who have been staying in the area over the past 14 days will have to remain quarantined at home for 14 days after communicating their presence in the region to medical staff.""

South Korea reported 161 new cases on Monday, bringing the country's total to 763 cases, and two more deaths raising that toll to seven. A lawmaker in Iran reported 50 deaths in Qom, though the country's health ministry said only 12 have died in the whole country. With further outbreaks likely to continue across the world, and Iraq and Turkey closing their borders to Iran after cases being reported there, financial markets could well have to get used to an extended period of uncertainty, as consumer behavior globally starts to change, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note to clients. There is already evidence that this is happening, with Chinese tourist numbers down across the world, while the French finance minister said that tourist numbers in France were already down over 30% at this weekend's G20 finance ministers meeting, he said.

What we are seeing are epidemics in different parts of the world, he told reporters on a conference call. That is technically true. The disease has shown up in pockets in South Korea and Italy, and isn't spreading like wildfire across the globe. But it may also miss the point, at least based on the market response.

It is unlikely [U.S. Treasury] yields will stay around current levels, Evercore portfolio strategist Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note to clients Sunday. In his view, there are two possibilities: Either the outlook for earnings collapse, credit spreads widen, 10-year yields decline sharply, and investors reduce gross exposure quickly (think December 2018). Or, he reasons, there could be a snapback in sentiment similar to the ones that followed the SARS and Ebola scares, [that] pushes yields and equities higher. That could put the yield on the 10-year Treasury note at 2% and support rate-sensitive cyclicals relative growth, he says. On Monday, the 10-year was yielding 1.36%. Investors have little expectation that there will be a medium- or long-term disruption of global supply chains as a result of the coronavirus, DeBusschere said. Based on a survey conducted by Evercore 80% of investors expect supply chains to return back to near-normal by July, indicating little expectation of longer-term disruptions, he said. So far, it seems investors are willing to look past negative guidance as transitory. That expectation for a relatively short disruption to China's economy, means that anything longer or more severe could cause the further drop in Treasury yields and stocks. And on the other hand, he said, if new cases drop off significantly in China in the coming weeks, that could lead to a strong bounce in global equity prices and Treasury yields.

Brian Heater,2/24/2020,techcrunch,Huawei's ill-fated foldable returns with a more robust upgrade,https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/huaweis-ill-fated-foldable-returns-with-a-more-robust-upgrade/,"MWC may have been canceled on account of rising coronavirus concerns, but the party still went on for Huawei (albeit to what appears to have been a mostly empty room). A year after wowing crowds with the Mate X, the company is introducing the Mate Xs.  Rather than a proper successor, the device appears to be the result of Huawei's decision to go back to the drawing board, following Samsung's very public problems with its own original foldable.  The design looks nearly identical to the original version of the phone ” which is a pro. Honestly, the one major downside of the device (aside from a lofty price tag) is the fact that it never fully arrived, outside of what appears to be a relatively small batch offering in China.  Like Samsung, Huawei's update focused a lot on the hinge; with increased mechanical components, the product should be more rugged than the original. Keep in mind that, while we were able to play around with the original Mate X, that was about it. Personally, I saw one at MWC and had an opportunity to try one for a few minutes during lunch, between meetings at Huawei HQ in Shenzhen.  Now that foldables have arrived, it seems Huawei is finally ready to take the leap. Of course, one ought not forget the company's ongoing issues here in the States that will not only make it more difficult to procure here, but also blocks access to Android apps and services. That will continue to be a major issue for the company's products, going forward.  Price, too, will continue to be an issue, at around $2,700 when it goes up for sale in certain markets next month. That extremely inflated price gets you a 6.6-inch display, 5G, a beefy 4,500 mAh battery, the latest Kirin 990 chip, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Go big and/or go home, right?",tech
Brian McGleenon,2/24/2020,express,Brexit latest: UK fishermen perfectly highlight EU hypocrisy over 'pillaging UK waters',https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1246424/brexit-news-latest-boris-johnson-eu-trade-talks-emmanuel-macron-political-news," Fishing for Leave has branded the EU's demands as egregious as they highlight the bloc's hypocrisy over its insistence to continue to fish in UK waters post-Brexit. They wrote on Twitter: EU demands perpetual pillaging of 60% of Britain's fish for a deal & folk shrug. If we demanded EU oil & gas to allow BMW sales there'd be outrage. It comes after France's European Affairs Minister AmΓ©lie de Montchalin warned Boris Johnson Paris is ready to fight for fishing rights. The French minister warned the Prime Minister the EU will not be pushed into a ""bad deal"" just to ensure Mr Johnson is able to keep true to his pledge. Ms de Montchalin insisted the bloc will ensure their ""fishermen, farmers and business"" are protected under the new agreement as she said she will ""make clear"" to British business what they are set to lose should the Government fail to find common ground with Brussels. She added: Our fishermen, they need to be protected but they know very well that, if we sign a bad deal, they are going to lose enormously."" FOLLOW EXPRESS.CO.UK FOR LIVE UPDATES:   22.00 pm: Keir Starmer hints that he will renew EU freedom of ovement if Labour elected in 2024 Labour leader contender Sir Keir Starmer has hinted he could bring back EU freedom of movement at the next general election if he replaces Jeremy Corbyn. 3.43 pm update: Possible Italy recession due to coronavirus Former prime minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi expressed his fear that the coronavirus may cause a recession in Italy. He tweeted: Alongside the health emergency, there is a serious problem for our economic system. The loss of a few decimals of GDP, forecast by all economists, risks canceling the already very low growth and bringing us back into recession.  Additional reporting by Emily Ferguson  2.37pm update: Brexit 'makes it difficult for EU to survive' Brexit will make it difficult for the EU to survive, predicts one economist who claims the bloc could face intense pressure to reform if a post-Brexit trade deal cannot be reached by the end of the year. British economist Roger Bootle has claimed the EU is already feeling the effects of Brexit, as the EU27 failed to reach an agreement on the terms of the bloc's next long-term budget last week. The chairman of Capital Economics also warned if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal in place, Brussels may come under intense pressure to reform. He said Britain's departure will either force reform or, if the bloc resists, the EU is doomed. 1.53pm update: Minister insists there will not be a border down the Irish Sea Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has insisted there will not be a border down the Irish Sea. He said: ""I think it's safest not to get too caught up in rumours and stuff in the press over the weekends, we are focusing on our main job. ""We have always said we want to make sure there is unfettered access between GB and Northern Ireland, we've always as a government obviously gone by the rule of law and we will continue to do that. ""We want to make sure that the United Kingdom is one whole union, and one that is good for business across the United Kingdom. ""We've always said there will not be a border down the Irish Sea, there will be unfettered access for business."" 1.30pm update: Economist reveals Boris Johnson's 'powerful bargaining chip' 1.22pm update: POLL: Should the House of Lords be scrapped after expenses claims soar? The House of Lords has come under fire for soaring expenses after it was revealed claims have shot up by 29 percent, in the last financial year - rising to a whopping Β£23million. Peers pocketed over Β£23million in expenses and daily attendance allowance in the 2018/2019 financial year, the Sunday Times report. As a result, do you think the second chamber should be scrapped?

As announced earlier this month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to visit Ireland between March 3 and 5 - a trip taking place at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. During this trip, Kate and William will travel across Dublin, County Meath, County Kildare and Galway. In a statement, Kate and William's office said this visit will build on the theme of remembrance and reconciliation. 12.33pm update: Europe urge UK to respect Irish protocal Brussels has said the Withdrawal Agreement must be effectively implemented.

""Of course, in this context as in all others, we would expect our partners to respect their international obligations under their national law and under international law - that includes, of course, the Withdrawal Agreement which has legal force. ""Obviously, with respect to the future and how this plays in the negotiation, of course respecting our legal obligations is very important for establishing trust between two partners in a negotiation."" 12pm update: Government to publish negotiating mandate on Thursday The UK Government will publish its negotiating mandate for trade talks with the EU on Thursday.  11.33am update: The FIVE Brexit trade demands Boris is set to make Boris Johnson will set out his plans for a post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels this week ahead of starting formal negotiations with the EU. The Prime Minister is expected to set out a series of demands to sign a basic free-trade agreement with the bloc. It is understood he will not request any bespoke or special arrangements from his European counterparts, instead favouring similar arrangements afforded to Canada, Japan and South Korea in their own pacts with Brussels. Check HERE to see the full article on the PM's five demands. 11.01am update: Iain Duncan-Smith calls on experts to handle Brexit Iain Duncan-Smith has called on experts to help with the final stage of Brexit negotiations. The former Tory leader told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I think there are problems ahead for the UK. ""One of them is the quality of the people now working on this. If you haven't negotiated for 40 years you need to reach out to all those people that are involved in negotiations, really good transactional lawyers that exist in the City of London. Proper trade economists. We've got very good ones at the moment but we need to bring them in from outside."" The former Tory leader explained that expertise from outside the civil service might now be needed to help battle with the European Union's skilled negotiators. 10.22am update: France will not be 'blackmailed' into a rushed trade deal with the UK AmΓ©lie de Montchalin, France's secretary of state for European affairs has said she will bring a ""clear Brexit message"" to London this week. She told broadcaster France 24: Just because Boris Johnson wants a deal at all costs on December 31 does not mean that we will sign under the pressure of blackmail or the calendar a bad deal for the French."" The minister added Paris would not sacrifice our farmers, fishermen, businesses to secure a deal before the deadline. 9.40am update: US-UK deal at risk of 'undercutting' British farmers, warns MP UK farmers must be protected in a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, warned former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers who told the BBC there could be a risk to agriculture earnings. Former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers told the BBC Today show that US-UK trade negations must recognise that exposing our farmers to food produced to lower standards may affect them earning a living. Ms Villiers, who lost her position in Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle, was very outspoken on the matter, making it clear that the UK should stick to the standards we have now in terms of animal welfare and imports.  9.03am update: Starmer vows to scrap salary thresholds for migrants Sir Keir Starmer, who is currently a frontrunner in the Labour leadership contest, has vowed to scrap salary thresholds for migrants coming to Britain if he becomes Labour leader. He said the scheme was not the ""right measure for the worth of an individual coming to this country"". The salary thresholds are set to be introduced under the Government's post-Brexit immigration system. The salary threshold for skilled migrants will be lowered to Β£25,600 for those coming to the UK with a job offer and there may be concessions for those earning no less than Β£20,480 as long as they still meet certain requirements or their occupation is short of staff. 8.42pm update: Business leaders urge PM to avoid Brexit trade battle Business leaders have urged Boris Johnson to avoid pursuing a strict negotiating stance with the EU. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) appealed to the Government to limit bureaucracy for firms who are already fearful of a no deal exit at the end of the year. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, unveiled a string of demands for British officials going into the talks, including trusted trader schemes, simplified paperwork for customs checks and reciprocal mobility agreements for business trips to European countries. 8.15pm update: Irish minister 'worried' about Brexit talks Simon Coveney, the TΓ΅naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, has said he is concerned over recent developments in Brexit tradel talks. He said: I'm really worried about where Brexit is going “ and I don't mind saying that publicly. Prime Minister Johnson has put a cabinet together which is really about ensuring that there is no decent on the Brexit question."" Mr Coveney warned the Brexit outlined by the UK Prime Minister was ""simply not consistent"" with the type of deal the EU is pursuing. 8am update: France eyes up British fishing waters as EU draws up shopping list of demands The EU look set to insist the UK must stay closely aligned with Brussels' rules, as French President Emmanuel Macron has said Britain must comply with strict level playing field provisions. The main stumbling block for the EU at the moment concerns a tariff-free, quota-free trade deal, the Financial Times reports. Earlier this month Brussels' draft mandate was circulated, which stated the UK had to stay in line with EU environmental and labour market rules and also continue applying EU restrictions on state aid. But Boris Johnson has repeatedly affirmed Britain's desire to break free from EU rules, and said such a demand was unacceptable. President Macron said at the weekend that he was not sure a deal could be struck by the December 31 deadline, which marks the end of the Brexit transition period. He also predicted the negotiations would be tense with fishing rights a key point of contention.

Robin Hicks",2/24/2020,eco-business,Fear? Cost? Fame? What's turning on Asian businesses to renewable energy?,https://www.eco-business.com/news/fear-cost-fame-whats-turning-on-asian-businesses-to-renewable-energy/,"Lionel Steinitz, the founder and chief executive of Singapore-based renewable energy firm LYS Energy Group,Β came to Singapore nearly 20 years ago and spent his first year in the city-state serving the French army. The next 11 years of two decades lived in Singapore to date were spent in the banking industry, until 2011, not long after the global financial meltdown of 2008. It felt like people were throwing stones at me in the streets, because [as bankers] people assumed we were responsible for the financial crisis. The job had lost a lot of its appeal at the time, recalled the Frenchman. In the year he quit banking, over a series of conversations with a cousin stationed in Singapore doing an internship at a solar company, Steinitz was inspired by the link between solar and finance.Β If you invest in a solar project, you get returns by selling energy every month, on a long term basis, he explained. Any industry that relies on subsidies to sustain itself is going to fail. Steinitz set upΒ LYS EnergyΒ the following year, when the price of energy was high. It was, he said, a win win opportunity; he could offer customers green energy that was cheaper than the grid, and investorsΒ steady and predictable returns. His firmΒ of 30 employees operating in five countries in Southeast Asia nowΒ develops, finances, installs and operates solar systems for commercial, industrial and public sites. Lionel Steinitz, CEO, LYS Energy Group. Image: LYS Energy We're aΒ small company and can't compete with very large firms on the cost of capital. So, we have to offer something different”innovation, he said. LYS is a pioneer in the trade of renewable energy certificates for companies that are unable to cut all of their carbon emissions. It also offers electric vehicle (EV) firms fully decarbonised solutions and is working on a solar-storage solution it hopes to deploy across Southeast Asia. But selling solar isn't always easy in a region that has been slower than anywhereΒ in the world to embrace renewables, and is the only geography in which coal is actually growing in the energy mix. In this interview with Eco-Business, Steinitz talks about what's holding the energy transition back, why corporates make the switch to renewables, and why he's optimistic that the energy transition will happen faster that we think. The first is obvious”savings. I have never seen any company adopt renewables purely out of altruism. There's always a commercial angle.Β Owners of large real estate portfolios try to monetise their rooftop assets, other companies want to diversify their energy source, or simply adopt solarΒ to hedge against rising energy costs. However, big and small companies are different in their approach. Multinationals, recognising their obligation to reduce their carbon footprint, act as trendsetters. And they know how to leverage this in their marketing and communications. Smaller firms are more short-sighted and want to see cost savings right away. For instance, they will choose a solar installation purely based on price, with disregard for quality and safety. The solar industry suffers from a bias in perception: you put a few modules on a roof, connect a few cables, and”bam”you're a solar installer. But the engineering is complex and subtle if you want to do achieve optimal performance. Further, wannabe Β players totally miss out on the fact that the critical part of a solar project sits in the 25-year period of operation, when, if you don't monitor and maintain your system with enough granularity, you will not generate the expected returns. In addition, a growing concern I have is that second-tier installersΒ may introduce safety hazards into a client's premises if the solar system is not conceived and installed properly, and one fire incident can set the industry back years. Firstly, this statement is absolutely false. Once you've made this argument, then what? Do nothing, because it's not a perfect approach? No. Secondly, offset mechanisms areΒ a necessity”after you've measured and reduced emissions as far as possible. Two sectors that are particularly difficult to reduce emissions from are aeroplanes and taxis. The aviation business is about puttingΒ aircrafts in the air, and that generates a lot of CO2 emissions. The technologies that will allow aircrafts to cut emissions substantially are still years away. The same applies for taxi firms. We innovated the issuance and the trading of renewable energy certificates in Singapore, which are the instruments available to offset the carbon emissions that cannot be reduced directly. This may sound naΓ―ve, but I believe that the actors in this ecosystem are genuinely interested in addressing climate change and don't cheat. I am aware however that there will always be some individuals out to make quick money, but the market is essentially driven by climate enthusiasts who want to put a framework together that works for everybody. Secondly, the certifiers areΒ allΒ audited by independent third parties, are scrutinised by regulators, and the issuance programmes are shared by the platforms. In that respect, blockchain technology, which is increasingly used by certifiers, offers further security. It is fundamental that there should be no subsidies for renewable energy. Otherwise it defeats the purpose.Β After the 2008 global financial crisis, in countries where renewablesΒ subsidies weighed heavily on government budgets, and consequently were cut and feed-in tariffs ended, the renewables industry collapsed. Any industry that relies on subsidies to sustain itself is going to fail. Besides,Β the LCOE [levelised cost of energy] of renewables is dropping year after year. Even though there may be some noise around [the cost of] infrastructure”for instance temporary spikes in prices dues to supply chain interruptions (as we are witnessing today with the coronavirus in China)”the general price trend is down. Consequently, grid parity is here to stay, and there is no justification to use tax payers' money to subsidise renewables. That obstacle can be overcome, if countries do what Singapore did last year andΒ open upΒ their energy markets. But in countries where there is a monopoly over the energy market, an open market will mean that the big state-owned utilities will need to find new sources of revenue, which will create a challenge for governments to balance their budgets. Also, opening up markets too fast may create issues further down the road, and governments have a responsibility to keep critical infrastructure running. The single biggest factor holding the energy transition back isΒ mindsets”and they're slow to change. Different stakeholders need to be convinced of the value of renewables. The mindset of regulators is caution, of bankers is greed, and of consumers is to let others go first and follow later. Regulators need time to think things through, and make sure any new regulation promoting renewables will not hurt consumers or the country in the future. Their time horizons are different”they think decades ahead, whereas businesses think in quarters. And that is a challenge. Regarding finance, it is difficult to get the investment community to support renewables. The risks associated with our industry are not well understood or assessed, and the returns are perceived to be too low; I will admit that you will never get the same returns of a hyped high-tech company, but then solar will not take you to the cleaners! As for consumers, it is still difficultΒ notΒ to go on a holiday to a beautiful place when you have access to cheap air tickets? Right? You get the point. That's the hypocrisy of where we are today. I am an entrepreneur, so I'm an optimist. I don't give up. A major source of hope comes from my kids”who are 10, 13, 15”and the legacy I will pass on to them. Even though I feel discouraged and frustrated at times, I believe that we are close to a fundamental change in the energy sector. I refer to the bookΒ Tipping Point:Β We don't need a very large percentage of the population to go green for radical change to happen. Instead, the tipping point may be a low double-digit shift where new methods, solutions, and innovations become visible to everyone, and are enough to trigger an overall change in mentality. And I believe we are much closer to the tipping point than many people think. We would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle.

The problem is many of those who returned to China are at senior levels and this has affected decision making, said Chandra Dwiputra, managing director of the Chinese-Indonesian joint venture building the railway, PT Kereta Api Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC). Project directors, managers, engineers and consultants are among the absent Chinese workers. I can't talk about targets for this year, Chandra added, reports Radio Free Asia (RFA). Two thousand of the project's 14,000 workforce are Chinese nationals. More trouble is caused by the fact that nearly 50% of materials, including pipes, waterproofing and signalling equipment are made in China. Their supply has been interrupted by the shutdown of manufacturing in China as authorities sought to contain the outbreak. Chandra said: Concrete, steel and some other materials are available here, but if there are no supporting materials, construction will be disrupted. He has asked contractors to replace Chinese workers with Indonesians temporarily. The point is I am encouraging contractors to adjust plans according to the current conditions, he said.

Callum Hoare,2/24/2020,express,Coronavirus setback: Vaccine to take 'over a decade' as cases surge across Europe,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1246645/coronavirus-vaccine-italy-decade-china-wuhan-sars-mers-cure-spt," The deadly virus has now claimed the lived of 2,600 people after infecting more than 79,000 worldwide. Experts now fear a global pandemic, after Italy confirmed six people have died following a surge in cases. Over the weekend, Australian scientist claimed they had developed a vaccine, adding to the list of international researchers trying to bring a cure to market as soon as possible. But, Nicola Stonehouse, professor in molecular virology at the University of Leeds, has warned it could take decades before that is a reality. She told Wired earlier this month: To make a vaccine conventionally “ to test it and actually get it on the market “ can take a decade, and has done. In fact, it's taken several decades for some vaccines in the past. Unfortunately, she added, creating a vaccine is a slow and meticulous process.   It can take a decade, and has done Nicola Stonehouse They have to go through multiple stages of development “ from discovery to clinical trials before they can be passed as safe. Dr Stonehouse explained why many manufacturers will lose motivation to produce the vaccine the longer the outbreak goes on. But that does not make their work useless. She added: Pharmaceutical companies generally don't make lots of money out of vaccines because you're offering them to a large amount of people, so you have to make them very cheap. There has to be some governmental pressure in order to promote the manufacture and distribution of vaccines.

The principles of doing the research and what you find out along the way can be applied to future projects.

Florian Krammer, professor in microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine, revealed how former outbreaks help speed up the process of creating a vaccine. She added: We know from the SARS vaccine that what we really need to target is that spike protein. That was demonstrated nicely with SARS and later on with MERS. We are way better prepared for this now. The coronavirus relies on this protein in order to spike through cells' defences and cause the infection. As with SARS and MERS, the vaccine will need to target this spike protein to stop it from entering the cell. But, in the last SARS outbreak, vaccines never went to market, as by the time scientists had developed one “ 20 months after the release of the virus genome “ the outbreak was already under control and drug firms were no longer willing to manufacture the vaccine.

Ceyda Caglayan,2/24/2020,reuters,"UPDATE 1-Buoyant Turkish tourism wary of slowdown due to Iran, coronavirus worries",https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-economy-tourism/update-1-buoyant-turkish-tourism-wary-of-slowdown-due-to-iran-coronavirus-worries-idUSL5N2AO2MF," By Ceyda Caglayan ISTANBUL, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Turkish tourist arrivals surged in January but there are signs of a slowdown in the following months, a hotel association said on Monday, while the closure of Turkey's border with Iran stoked fears about the impact of the coronavirus. The unease about the spread of the virus in Iran, a key source of tourists for Turkey, was illustrated on Monday as Turkish Airlines canceled flights to four Iranian cities. Tourism is an important source of foreign currency for Turkey, helping to rein in the energy importing country's usually wide current account deficit, and data on the sector is closely watched. On Monday, Tourism Ministry figures showed the number of foreign visitors arriving in Turkey surged 16.1% year-on-year in January to 1.79 million, with Iranians fourth on the list of countries with 6.7% of the market. The sharp rise in January was in line with the trend last year, when Turkey's tourism revenues rose 17% to $34.5 billion, but the Hotel Association of Turkey (TUROB) voiced caution about the outlook. The TUROB assessment showed signs of a slow February and a slowdown in March, despite the rise in the first month of the year, TUROB said in a statement. It said the hotel occupation rate in January had risen 6.4% from a year earlier to 61.9% but forecast a decline in both this rate and room prices in February and March. On Sunday, Turkey's health minister said the country had closed its border with Iran and halted incoming flights as a precaution to stop the potential spread of coronavirus. Tehran said 12 people have died and up to 61 have been infected by the virus in Iran. There are usually large numbers of Iranians who visit Turkey in March and April due to Iranian new year in late March, meaning that the length of the border closure could have a major impact on the tourism season, sector officials said. Last year as a whole, some 2.1 million Iranian tourists visited Turkey. Turkey has not recorded any cases of coronavirus but the large spike in Italian cases has especially rattled investors in Europe, concerned about the potential for the virus to spread further and cause economic disruption there. Shares in Turkish Airlines fell 5.6% on Monday, while Pegasus Airlines dropped 4.9%, in line with a slide in airline shares elsewhere over coronavirus worries.

"Chandelis Duster, CNN",2/24/2020,cnn,"Trump administration cancels plan to bring coronavirus patients to Anniston, Alabama following pushback from local officials",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/politics/alabama-coronavirus-patient-plan-canceled/index.html," The Trump administration has canceled plans to bring coronavirus patients to an Alabama city after pushback from local and state officials. The move comes amid concern about novel coronavirus cases in the United States and growing fears of a global pandemic. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday there were 53 confirmed cases of the virus in the US. The Department of Health and Human Services was evaluating the possibility of using a Federal Emergency Management Agency Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, as a backup location for Americans infected by the virus. During a press conference in Anniston on Monday morning, local and state officials said they were left in the dark about the federal government's plan to house coronavirus patients in the city. ""None of us at the city, the county or any of the people who you see up here today had any really advanced knowledge of this,"" Anniston Mayor Jack Draper said. ""We're simply not prepared to help our fellow citizens at this time who have been diagnosed with this disease,"" he continued, adding that after several meetings with HHS that he was not aware of a real plan nor of what would be expected of the local community, first responders and local health care. Read More Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican, said he spoke with President Donald Trump over the weekend about the plan and said the President was ""completely unaware"" of the plan and ""annoyed that these individuals had even been brought back to continental United States while they were still infected, but assured me he would get to work on trying to stop it."" CNN reached out to the White House for comment on Monday. Senators will be briefed Tuesday morning in a classified setting on the novel Coronavirus, two sources with knowledge of the plans told CNN Monday. One source said that the briefing will be in a classified setting because the senators who are organizing it wanted to be prepared in case a senator asks a question that can only be answered in such a setting. One source added that there will be briefers from the State Department, HHS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security and National Institutes of Health. On Sunday, HHS said it was ""identifying alternative sites"" to ""house and care for Diamond Princess passengers who have tested positive"" for the virus. ""The FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, was one site determined to be suitable and effective, but is not needed at this time,"" HHS in a statement. HHS told Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday it was evaluating the possibility of using the center as a backup location for some Americans infected by the virus, according to statements from the Alabama Department of Public Health and the governor's office. ""On Saturday, it appears that a press release from HHS was inadvertently, and perhaps prematurely, sent notifying the State of Alabama that these individuals were scheduled to begin transporting to Alabama as early as Wednesday,"" the Republican governor said in statement. Draper convened a council meeting to consider ""immediate legal action"" to stop the ""transportation and quarantine persons infected with coronavirus disease within the city of Anniston,"" the mayor said Sunday. In a separate press conference Monday, officials said they would not take legal action since there were government assurances that the plan was canceled. The leaders said they want to help those infected by the virus, but the state was not prepared to help at this time. ""The thing I want people to be mindful of is The Center for Domestic Preparedness is a world class training facility but it is no way prepared or equipped to deal with infectious diseases,"" Rogers said. Anniston residents who attended the press conference echoed the officials' sentiments. Anthony Gregory, a resident, told CNN he learned of coronavirus patients possibly coming to the city on Saturday and said it was ""very disturbing."" ""There's a lot of fear in regards to bringing people here that are infected into an area that is not prepared to deal with their infection,"" he said.

Charles Bierbauer,2/24/2020,theconversation,Trump White House goes 300+ days without a press briefing “ why that's unprecedented,https://www.theconversation.com/trump-white-house-goes-300-days-without-a-press-briefing-why-thats-unprecedented-130164,"Journalists learn to adapt to current conditions, be they storms or tantrums, vagaries of nature or whims of officials. White House correspondents these days should be well past their withdrawal symptoms from the daily delirium of the once-regular White House press briefing.  Earlier this year, as 300 days passed without a formal briefing, a bipartisan group of past administration press secretaries called for restoration of the daily briefings.  Bringing the American people in on the process, early and often, makes for better democracy, they said in an open letter on CNN.com.  The process of preparing for regular briefings makes the government run better. The sharing of information, known as official guidance, among government officials and agencies helps ensure that an administration speaks with one voice, the former spokespersons said, adding that this is particularly important in foreign and military policy. Beyond the daily digest of the president's activities, not all of which is public, reporters look to the briefings for depth and context for their reporting. They expect the White House press secretary and other officials to speak knowledgeably and authoritatively for the president and his administration.  For example, when the coronavirus outbreak was detected in China, reporters wanted to hear government officials explain what the U.S. government was doing to get Americans out of China and to keep the virus out of the U.S.   On another day, the press secretary could provide a corrective along the lines of What the president meant to say¦. There is no requirement to hold White House press briefings, nor to have them televised. Now, what once was part of the routine of government in Washington is, in the Trump administration, barely seen at the State Department and Pentagon and a fading memory at the White House. The country is left with a singular voice “ the president's “ but no idea whether he represents government consensus. The relationship between the president and the press is now more confrontational and more contemptuous than it has been in decades.  But while the press and the presidency have a long relationship, it has not necessarily been a cozy one. When Richard Nixon was president, for example, he had his enemies list that included journalists.  I covered the White House for CNN during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Reagan was well protected from the media by his staff and first lady Nancy Reagan. We shouted questions at him over the whir of helicopters.  Bush was affable and considerably more accessible. Donald Trump dominates when he engages with the White House press corps. He chooses when and how, of course, but that's always the case with presidents. Regular press conferences had a protocol and, at least, a measure of decorum. The president still decides whose questions he'll answer. Trump's preference for impromptu exchanges, commonly on the White House driveway, makes the press look like a shouting mob, which sometimes they are.   Trump, by most assessments, functions as his own press secretary. Those who hold the actual title “ three, so far “ learned it's a foxhole from which one raises his or her head into the president's verbal line of fire.  The first, Sean Spicer, was out of sync on day one with disputable claims over the size of Trump's inauguration crowd. The second, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, regularly battled with the press corps “ and the truth “ from the podium in the briefing room. Sanders held her last briefing on March 15, 2019.  I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway, Trump said.  Sanders' successor, Stephanie Grisham, has held none as of this writing and shows no inclination to. The press has unprecedented access to President Trump, yet they continue to complain because they can't grandstand on TV, Grisham told Axios. The most prominent reporters, especially from television, have the most visible front row seats in the compact briefing room and tend to ask the most questions. When I arrived on the White House beat in 1984, the reporters' pattern was to gather in Press Secretary Larry Speakes' office around 8:15 a.m. for an informal background briefing. It was a useful way to figure out where the day was headed.   By that time, the primary administration offices had decided what the line of the day would be. On a good day for the administration, they held the line. When other news broke, the discipline of the line tended to fall apart. The formal briefing was around midday, on the record, but rarely on camera. TV was allowed to shoot only the start of the briefing just to get brief video for the day's newscasts. President Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, acceded to media demands for regular live televised briefings. McCurry later thought better of it and joined former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer in 2017 in saying the briefings should be taped and shown later, not live.  Better for the public, the WH & the press, Fleischer tweeted in what he called a joint tweet with McCurry.  Briefings could be chummy or churlish. Speakes had a habit of declaring reporters out of business if he disagreed with their premise or line of questioning. Don't call; don't hang around my office, he'd say. It was a badge of honor for reporters. We'd call the chief of staff instead.  Marlin Fitzwater, who served both Reagan and Bush as press secretary, described us as just scratching at the surface of the iceberg. But he could be helpful by indicating what part of the iceberg to scratch at.   Press secretaries wear three hats, serving the public, the press and the president. It's the president, of course, who has first claim on their attention. In Trump's case, it's the press secretary who has been put out of business, or at least business as usual. Grisham unapologetically serves him. She's not known for being particularly helpful off camera.  Sanders had a better relationship with the press outside the combative briefing room. This is not an issue rising from the First Amendment, which proscribes Congress from making any law  abridging the freedom of the press.  The White House has, instead, retreated from the practice of preceding administrations. It's a presidential prerogative to decide when and how to communicate to public constituencies. Other administrations have sought ways to circumvent the media filter.  Franklin Roosevelt broadcast his fireside chats. Ronald Reagan began the tradition of delivering a weekly radio address. Donald Trump tweets. When the president himself talks to the media extemporaneously, it's more difficult to complain that the press secretary won't. What falls by the wayside, though, is the policy and detail that can be conveyed by officials responsible for either creating or communicating government's business.  Context and accountability are lost. It's a temptation for future presidents. Fitzwater titled his post-White House memoir Call the Briefing. No one on the president's staff is calling regular briefings these days. There are other briefings that take place at the White House, but not the daily regimen of the press secretary's briefing. But there hasn't been a lack of stories from and about the Trump White House. [You're smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation's authors and editors.

At a meeting of health ministers this month, he called on the EU to ""take responsibility"" and provide a plan for the bloc. He said: ""I would also like the World Health Organisation's request for financial aid to not only be answered by countries, but also that the EU takes on some responsibility with its own budgetary resources."" He added: It makes no sense that a single country takes measures on a continent with border-free travel between most nations."" Despite the spread of the coronavirus leading to deaths in Italy, the EU's Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has rejected the idea that coronavirus fears warrant restrictions on travel or trade. She said today: ""For the moment WHO has not advised imposing restrictions on either travel or trade."" Her message clearly did not reach those in Austria, as the country's government stopped a train arriving into the country yesterday evening from Italy. At least 152 people have been infected with coronavirus in Italy with four people dying in the last two days. Some towns in the Lombardy region “ located in the north of the country “ are in a state of lockdown as lawmakers attempt to stop the virus spreading.   Some politicians in Rome are also turning on EU law in their calls for suspension of the Schengen Convention, which permits free movement between the 26 european member states. Matteo Salvini has argued that the conditions of the agreement should be abandoned until the coronavirus is contained. However, Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte pushed back against the demand on Saturday, saying: ""I don't think the conditions for such a move exist at this point.""

Amongst conversation about her time on Strictly Come Dancing, the professional dancer was asked about her work as a dance teacher and how the Coronavirus was stopping her from seeing her students in China. The first reports of the COVID-19 diseases came from Wuhan, China, on New Year's Eve last year and since then the World Health Organisation has issued several warnings. Over the past two months, thousands more cases have emerged world wide, with 13 reported in the UK since January. With students over in the province of China where the outbreak emerged, Karen was asked how the possible pandemic was affecting her. After admitting she couldn't visit at the moment, the dancer hit out as she told the host: You just made my skin go funny. READ MORE: Heathrow Airport: Plane delayed as passenger panics over coronavirus   Susanna then asked: What contact have you had with those students who you've been coaching? How long did you last visit there? Where you are and where they are - how frightened are they? Karen explained she is still having some contact, adding: It's really interesting because I'm speaking to them live most days. And even just recently, they asked me to record a message because the coaching I do - we call it Olympic level coaching. You're teaching the elite and there are hundreds of thousands of dancers there, she said as she expressed her frustrations at not being able to go to China.   Made my skin go funny Karen Hardy It has been reported over 77,000 people in China have been diagnosed with the respiratory disease, of which 2,600 have died. Over 1,200 cases have been reported in 26 other countries around the world, of which there have been 20 deaths as a result of the outbreak spreading.

Although the window of opportunity is narrowing to contain the outbreak, we still have a chance to contain it. Mr Adhanom added: If we don't, if we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands. Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Dr Gerald Lyons, Chief Economist at Natwealth said of the repercussions of the outbreak: The world economy is slowing. At the beginning of the year, China and the rest of Asia looked likely to account for two-thirds of global growth this year.

Ciara Linnane,2/24/2020,marketwatch,National CineMedia stock soars 16% as lights-down' ad strategy boosts earnings,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/national-cinemedia-stock-soars-12-as-lights-down-ad-strategy-boosts-earnings-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"National CineMedia Inc. shares soared more than 16% Friday, after the cinema advertising network operator topped earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and surprised investors with a dividend hike. Centennial, Colorado-based National CineMedia NCMI, +0.48% posted net income of $19.1 million, or 24 cents a share, up from $16.3 million, or 21 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, topping the 21 cents FactSet consensus. Revenue rose 7.1% to $147.2 million ahead of the $140.0 million FactSet consensus. The company's board approved an increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 19 cents a share from 17 cents last quarter. The new dividend is payable March 17 to shareholders of record as of March 3. The new annual dividend rate implies a dividend yield of 9.50%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.83% of 1.80%. The company said it now expects 2020 revenue to be up 1.2% to 4.5%, or a range of $450 million to $465 million, up from $444.8 million in 2019. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter raised his price target to $10 from $9 and reiterated an outperform rating on the stock. We have confidence that NCM can expand its reach into the premium national ad market, and that the assumptions we have long held will ultimately come to pass, Pachter wrote in a note to clients. Specifically, we expect NCM to recoup ad dollars lost from the expansion of reserved seating, to drive growth in its regional business, and expand national ad revenue with its premium ad spots. See: Harley Quinn spinoff Birds of Prey' opens below expectations, but still captures box-office crown The company's premium ad strategy offers advertisers the opportunity to book slots during the first minutes of lights down, or the start of the showtime when the lights in a cinema are dimmed and more cinemagoers are in their seats. The premium the company can charge for those slots helped offset a 9% decline in attendance per screen in the quarter, said Pachter. Later in 2020, we also expect NCM to benefit as available inventory on TV and social media becomes scarce around the 2020 Olympics and upcoming presidential election, said the analyst. We also expect local revenue growth as contracts increasingly contain digital components, and as ads are pulled forward later in the pre-show. B. Riley FBR raised its stock price target to $9.00 from $7.50 on the report and reiterated a neutral rating. Heading into 2020, we would expect continued demand/CPM (cost per thousand impressions) strength from the lights down inventory and expect more visibility into platinum spot potential as the 2020-2021 upfront gets under way, analyst Eric Wold wrote in a note. The dividend hike is a surprising move and vote of confidence in the new ad strategy, he added. In case you missed it: Champagne, filet mignon and a movie on the side: Theaters are taking high-end risks to lure customers Separately, cinema chain operator Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK, -1.98% also raised its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 36 cents a share. But the company's fourth-quarter earnings fell short of estimates, with per-share earnings of 22 cents lagging behind the 43 cents consensus. Revenue fell to $788.8 million from $796.8 million, also below the FactSet consensus of $799 million. The new quarterly dividend of 36 cents will be paid March 20, to shareholders of record as of March 6, to imply a dividend yield of 4.41%.

Photograph by Pablo Porciuncula Brune/AFP via Getty Images A global market meltdown spurred by coronavirus concerns smacked marijuana stocks in Monday morning trading.

Aurora didn't immediately provide a comment. Azer says sector challenges just aren't fading as fast as investors had hoped. Such headwinds include a lackluster amount of retail stores in some populous regions, price pressure favoring value-based cannabis brands , and a glut of mid-priced pot that's simply not matching demand. What changed to prompt the downgrade, according to Azer, was what her team sees as a limited availability of edibles due to volume caps, something that will hinder growth in the much-hyped category .

In the past year European power company stocks have triggered a buying frenzy more akin to headline-grabbing U.S. tech giants following the continent's green deal. An EU target to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and expectations of an associated spending boom have fired up shares in electricity firms, providing by far the biggest boost to stock market gains in Europe this year. The pan-European utilities index has gained over 20%since the European Union launched its ambitious green deal in December, dwarfing the 6% rise in the broader equity benchmark . And the sector that is often dismissed as boring because of its predictable revenues and tight regulation, is set for its best 10-week run ever, with returns on many of its components outdoing the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Google. The zero carbon plan could unleash 7 trillion euros ($7.6 trillion) of cumulative investments, Goldman Sachs estimates, with utilities accounting for nearly half of that. Goldman anticipates an era of unprecedented growth and regulatory stability for utilities and sees a sustained re-rating for firms it has dubbed as Climate Champions - Orsted, RWE, EDP Enel, EDPR, and Iberdrola. The growing influence of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) on portfolio decisions is also helping. Barclays data late last month showed that 31% of global funds are overweight on European utilities, the highest level in five years. ESG is intensifying the pace at which active and passive funds move into winner' sectors, including utilities, said Antonio Amendola, fund manager at AcomeA in Milan. AcomeA's funds have exposure to utility stocks, although it has not disclosed which ones. Some of the sugar rush is also down to investors' search for safe-haven equity assets at a time when the coronavirus outbreak threatens to inflict significant damage on the global economy. These businesses which are less tied to the economic cycle tend to benefit too from the continued drop in borrowing costs. Power stocks may lack the glamour of the FAANG quintet - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - but look back over a one-year period and this group of boring electricity generators has easily outperformed their tech counterparts.

Diana Olick@in/dianaolick@DianaOlickCNBC@DianaOlick,2/24/2020,cnbc,Coronavirus fears could push mortgage rates past 4-year low,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/coronavirus-fears-could-push-mortgage-rates-past-4-year-low.html,"As coronavirus fears hit financial markets, U.S. bond yields are tanking, pushing mortgage rates that loosely follow the 10-year Treasury yield toward an eight-year low. They could sink even lower. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage hit 3.34% on Monday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is for borrowers with strong financials and credit scores. ""Aggressive lenders will be at 3.25% today, and 3.375% will be the new going rate for the average lender,"" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. That rate hit 3.34% for one day in the summer of 2016, before spiking much higher that fall. Before that, rates were this low in 2012. While rates generally follow the 10-year yield, there are certain market factors that keep rates above a certain level. ""When rates fall this quickly, it's not so much that big banks draw the line on mortgage rates, but rather, the underlying Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) market refuses to improve as quickly as the Treasury market,"" said Graham. ""Both mortgages and Treasuries are feeling the impact of coronavirus panic. That's pushing rates lower. But mortgages also become less valuable to investors if they get paid off too quickly."" And those payoffs, or refinances, are surging right now. Applications to refinance a home loan are up around 165% annually, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Mortgage applications to purchase a home have not been as strong, due to the severe shortage of homes for sale. Builders, however, may be getting a boost, especially those putting up more affordable homes. Another barrier to entry for some buyers is still-tight lending standards. Sean Dobson, CEO of Amherst Holdings, which does have a mortgage arm, said tight lending is why his company got into the single-family rental business. ""Unless you have a large down payment or unless you have a very solid amount of free cash flow that's underwritable, and we forget about this because the Uber driver might not have income that is fungible from a mortgage lenders perspective, or the people working 3 or 4 jobs, or the contributors to CNBC who contribute to a few places, they may literally have trouble qualifying for a mortgage,"" said Dobson.",finance

Home Depot Inc. HD, +2.06% is the lone Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% component on the docket, and will be joined by plenty of other retailers that will add to the recent results from Walmart Inc. WMT, +2.04% More than 440 members of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% have already delivered results and 41 more companies are set to join them in the week ahead, with non-retail reports largely focused on software. Barring major issues in retail and cloud earnings, the S&P is set to snap the streak of earnings declines that it experienced for most of last year . Net income fell on a year-over-year basis during the first three quarters of 2019, but FactSet now models growth of 0.86% for the fourth quarter, taking into account the 1.3% growth from companies that have already reported earnings and analysts' projections for the rest. The projection for earnings growth comes in a reversal of sentiment from the start of reporting season, when analysts were projecting a continuation of the earnings recession, which exists when profits drop for two or more consecutive quarters. Here's what to watch for in the week ahead. Retail Walmart Inc. helped usher in retail earnings with a disappointing forecast , partly due to the coronavirus impact , but detailed the money it can save by getting rid of bags . Now a host of other retailers are preparing to report, including Home Depot and Macy's Inc. M, +5.98% Tuesday morning, Lowe's Cos. Inc. LOW, +3.07% and TJX Cos Inc.

These names are among 16 bricks-and-mortar retailers that Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub has on his list for the coming weeks, out of 40 total, and he said earnings per share for the category are expected to rise 0.9%. Those that have already posted results have beaten bottom-line expectations by 4.5%, he wrote. Software Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +2.59% , the biggest name in cloud software, will kick off a wave of software results Tuesday afternoon. There was some concern about the corporate-spending landscape late last year, but early results from companies like ServiceNow Inc. NOW, +0.71% have inspired more confidence in the software sector . Box Inc.'s BOX, +1.05% will report a few days after peer Dropbox Inc. DBX, +4.04% issued encouraging results and forward commentary that pushed shares to their largest single-day gain on record.

Emily Ferguson,2/24/2020,express,"Coronavirus Italy news: 50,000 under martial law' as police lock down towns",https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1246505/coronavirus-italy-latest-news-italy-travel-milan-coronavirus-symptoms-latest," Cases of coronavirus surged in Italy over the weekend forcing officials to impose draconian rules “ seen by many as a form of martial law - in a bid to halt the spread of the outbreak. The coronavirus, formally called COVID-19, has so far claimed four lives in Italy and infected 152, prompting authorities to impose fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. Police, who routinely carry guns in Italy, are patrolling 11 towns, mostly in the Lombardy region in the north of the country, after the government passed an emergency decree late on Saturday following the emergence of the first locally transmitted case on Friday. The decree enables extraordinary measures to tackle the spread of the biggest European outbreak of coronavirus, including placing entire towns under lockdown. It includes powers to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones and fine those breaching the rules. The measures also mandate that police and armed forces have the authority to ensure the regulations are enforced. Italy's industrial heartlands Lombardy and Vento, which jointly account for 30 percent of gross domestic output, are the worst hit areas in Italy.   Around a dozen towns in these regions have been placed on lockdown, resulting in some 50,000 people being forced into quarantine. The residents have been told to stay home and avoid social contact, as schools, shops and businesses have been closed. Several events have been cancelled, including several Serie A football matches and the final two days of the Venice carnival. Schools and universities will also be closed for at least a week in Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, while similar measures have been taken in Liguria and Alto Adige. JUST IN: Heathrow Airport: Plane delayed as passenger panics over coronavirus  On Sunday morning locals queued outside a supermarket in the town of Casalpusterlengo, 31 miles (50km) southeast of Milan as shoppers were only allowed to enter in groups of 40. One man told AFP the measures were inhuman. He said: It's inhuman. Fighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting. The spread of the virus prompted to fashion designer Giorgio Armani to prevent guests from attending a show on Sunday afternoon as part of Milan fashion week.

He said: It's a prudent measure, then we'll see if a week is sufficient. There are so many events in the city.  I don't imagine everything shutting down and being cancelled, but events that are not obligatory and which can be postponed, should be. Officials ramped up efforts to contain the virus after a 78-year-old Italian man in the Veneto region died on Friday. A fourth person infected with coronavirus died on Monday. The man was in his 80s and had been in hospital for treatment for an unrelated illness when he was struck by the virus.

Emily Hennings ,2/24/2020,express,Dan Walker shut down by James Brokenshire over Priti Patel bullying' probe,https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1246445/Dan-walker-bbc-breakfast-shut-down-james-brokenshire-priti-patel-allegations-video," Dan Walker spoke to James Brokenshire live this morning on BBC Breakfast about security measures, Coronavirus and Priti Patel, who hit back at allegations she is distrusted by intelligence chiefs and bullied her staff at the weekend. The BBC host was keen to find out more but Mr Brokenshire quickly shut down his probe. Walker began: Can I ask you first of all, in terms of how these proposals will work, how do you come up with something that covers everything from a major venue to a local pub? Brokenshire explained: I think that's a very fair question and what we are doing is committing to introducing, in essence, a statutory duty on venue operators and owners to have regards to the threat of terrorism. Clearly that's going to vary enormously from a huge stadium to a much smaller organization and therefore the scalability of that. And so the training for some of those smaller organisations, being vigilant about suspicious behaviour or activity, it's not necessarily for everyone to put metal arches even though it may be appropriate in some places. READ MORE: Good Morning Britain viewers in meltdown as Piers Morgan replaced   Walker interrupted: In terms of making sure you do bring these things into legislation and making sure that every venue has to do this, what about those small businesses that are getting in contact with us and saying We can't afford that training' and We can't afford those measures? '"" Brokenshire went on: Well I think it's understanding and I hear that message, which is why, one, we are doing the consultation but secondly, understanding that a lot of the steps don't require an awful lot of expenditure. It is about learning how to work with your staff and understand where the right exit points are.    So I am sure that a lot of the steps are already being taken whether that be on fire preparedness or health and safety, but also having an understanding of a threat. Mr Walker went on to ask about the bullying allegations made against Ms Patel. Following reports MI5 had held back information, Ms Patel and Sir Phillip Rutnam, the most senior civil servant in her department both denied there was any animosity. A spokesperson for both told the BBC they were focused on delivering their department's hugely important agenda. I want to ask you about Home Secretary Priti Patel, I'm sure you have seen the allegations about intelligence chiefs who don't trust her, who have not been sharing intelligence with her,"" Walker remarked.

And the fact that the security service, as I well know, have continued to operate in the same way as they have done with other Home Secretaries on daily briefings and that is what's required. As civil servants and ministers, nothing is going to distract us from that. That is what the public wants us to do. That is what the Home Secretary is very focused on delivering and that is what she is going to do.  Walker interrupted: It's a very serious allegation, the other allegation around her is that she has created this climate of fear and that could affect the bringing through of legislation. So the question I want you to address this morning is, is she a bully? Brokenshire quickly shut down Walker, snapping: I simply do not recognise the commentary and the false accusations and assertions that in so many ways have been swirling around. It is not going to distract us from the task at hand on protecting the public and on delivering on the Government's agenda. Priti Patel is a strong Home Secretary, as you need to be in this situation, where the Home Office is a very challenging place."" BBC Breakfast continues on BBC One tomorrow at 6am.

Photograph by Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images In the latest signs of trouble in the tech supply chain, the electrical connector manufacturer Amphenol on Monday warned that it won't meet its original guidance for 2020 sales and adjusted earnings per share for the March quarter due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus outbreak in China. The company said that the uncertainty around when it can return to full production in China and a lack of visibility on demand from China customers make it impossible quantify the specific impact on its business. Amphenol's (ticker: APH) announcement echoes the cautions comments last week from its client Apple (AAPL), which a week ago warned that a combination of supply chain and demand issues tied to the virus would make it impossible to hit previous guidance. We are experiencing a slower return to normal business conditions than we originally anticipated, resulting from the limited availability of our workforce and supplier constraints, together with reduced demand from customers within China who have not yet returned to expected production levels, Amphenol CEO R. Adam Norwitt said in a statement. As of today, all of our China operations have reopened and more than 60% of our China-based employees have returned to work, despite ongoing significant restrictions on movement within China. Outside of China, customer demand remains in line with our expectations. Our company continues to be fundamentally strong, and we believe that this disruption to our China-related business is only temporary. Editor's Choice Citi analyst Jim Suva points out in a research note Monday that Amphenol generated about 30% of revenue from customers in China, and that it gets a high-single-digit percentage of revenue from Apple, so the announcement is not that surprising. Suva, who has a Buy rating and $115 target price on Amphenol shares, thinks sales lost in the March quarter are likely to be recouped in subsequent quarters. We believe that the demand issue is transitory in nature and that Amphenol should be able to ramp up capacity quickly as workers return to the company's factories in China. There should be more commentary on supply chain issues later Monday, when HP (HPQ) reports January quarter financial results , with further data points on Thursday when Dell Technologies (DELL) reports January quarter results. Adding to the investor jitters on the tech supply chain, Samsung temporarily shut down production at one of its factories on Sunday after one of its workers was diagnosed with the virus. Amphenol shares on Monday are down 4.1%, to $97.59. Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com",business
Eric J. Savitz,2/24/2020,marketwatch,"For Apple Stock, the Fear is Some Demand Will Be Destroyed, Not Delayed.",https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/for-apple-stock-the-fear-is-some-demand-will-be-destroyed-not-delayed-51582564234,"The fundamental question facing Apple (AAPL) investors this morning is whether the supply-chain issues from the coronavirus crisis is going to cause any lasting damage to the company's business. Most analysts think otherwise. But there is a case that the situation underlines the needs for more caution about a company so reliant on China for components, manufacturing and sales. Apple shares are down more than 4% in this morning's broad virus-triggered market rout ” and the stock is now down about 7% since it warned last week that March quarter revenue will fall short of previous guidance as a result of both supply-chain and demand issues tied to the virus. Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note over the weekend that while he was chopping his March quarter revenue estimate by $8.6 billion, to $57 billion, to reflect Apple's warning, he believes that revenue is shifting out, rather disappearing entirely. In fact, in his model, he simply shifts all of that revenue to the next two quarters. His full-year earnings per share and revenue estimates are unchanged. We think it's prudent to look at the supply issues as transitory in nature and it should resolve itself over time, he wrote. In addition, if further [virus-related] escalation triggered a selloff, we think management will be aggressive with buybacks. Daryanani kept his Outperform rating and $365 price target. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who kept his Outperform rating and $400 target price on Apple shares, wrote in a research note Monday that all the Street's focus is on the supply chain and gauging when some form of normalization begins around iPhone production throughout China and the region. The question that the investors are grappling with, Ives says, is when the situation begins to normalize. And supply is only part of the equation ” he notes that his model has China accounting for 17% to 20% of iPhone sales over the next 12 to 18 months. Ives wrote that our hand-holding thesis since this coronavirus outbreak began is that it is primarily a timing issue for iPhone demand and ultimately once the supply chain gets back toward full capacity the Apple renaissance of iPhone growth story will resume. In his note, Ives laid out best case, base case, and worst case scenarios. In the best case, he says, the supply chain is largely back to normal by early April, planned fall 5G iPhone launches aren't delayed and China demand rebounds into the June and September quarters. In the base case, he sees a supply chain recovery taking until late April or early May, potentially pushing out the 5G iPhone launch by a few weeks at most, with China demand recovering, but with some contained demand destruction. In his worst case scenario, the supply chain doesn't fully recover until late May or even June, the 5G iPhone is pushed out three months or more, and while China demand rebounds, demand destruction is clear throughout the region. It's that risk of demand destruction that would throw a curveball at investors who think the issues here are simply about timing of demand. Barclays analyst Tim Long, who has an Equal Weight rating on Apple share, wrote last week that while many will view this situation as transitory, another China issue (after tariffs) highlights an inherent risk with Apple being too exposed to the supply chain in China. And with the stock recently trading dramatically above its historic valuation range on a forward P/E basis, any perception that the virus outbreak has exposed Apple to be more vulnerable to China demand and supply-chain shocks than previously expected could have a lingering impact on the shares. Apple on Monday was down 4.4%, to $299.23. The stock has not closed below the $300 level since Jan. 7, Note that the stock is now up just slightly from the 2019 year-end close at $293.65.

Eric J. Savitz,2/24/2020,marketwatch,HP Announces Huge Stock Buyback and Again Rejects Xerox Takeover,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/hp-announces-huge-stock-buyback-and-again-rejects-xerox-takeover-51582579070,"Photograph by Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images In its latest move to counter a takeover bid from Xerox Holdings , HP Inc. said Monday that it would buy back up to $15 billion worth of stock, a figure equal to half its current market value. The announcement came on a busy afternoon for HP (ticker: HPQ), which once again rejected Xerox's (XRX) latest takeover offer as too low, while reporting better-than-expected profit for its January quarter. HP's shares rose 5.4% in late trading Monday. Despite the latest rejection , HP opened the door for talks with Xerox to consider a possible transaction, triggering new speculation that HP might turn the tables and make its own bid for Xerox. HP said it expects to return about $16 billion to shareholders from now through fiscal 2020, about half of the company's current $32 billion market capitalization. As part of that program, the HP board has increased its current stock repurchase authorization to $15 billion, from $5 billion. HP says it will repurchase at least $8 billion of stock in the 12 months following its 2020 annual shareholders' meeting. (A date for the meeting hasn't been announced.) HP returned a combined $9.1 billion to shareholders over the last three years. Over the long term, HP said it would seek to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form buybacks and dividends. Without announcing specifics, HP said it would fund the share repurchase program through debt. As for Xerox's bid, which recently increased to $24 per HP share, HP said the offer undervalues HP, creates significant risk and compromises HP's future. At the same time, HP said it is reaching out to Xerox to explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP's strategic and financial plan, adding that the HP board is committed to pursuing the most value-creating path and to serving HP shareholders' best interests. HP CEO Enrique Lores told Barron's Monday that HP has held conversations with Xerox before and that we are open to continuing those conversations. Lores didn't respond directly to a question about whether HP would be the acquirer in a potential deal. The news came late Monday as HP reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter profits and raised its full year profit guidance, noting that any impact on its business from coronavirus would be transitory. HP also set a fiscal 2022 profit target well above current Street expectations, likely reflecting the impact of the newly planned share buybacks. Revenue for the January quarter was $14.6 billion, down a fraction from a year ago and in line with Street estimates. Non-GAAP profits were 65 cents a share, well ahead of the guidance range of 53 cents to 56 cents, and above the Street at 54 cents. GAAP profits were 46 cents a share, ahead of the guidance range of 39 cents to 42 cents a share. The results were driven by the company's personal systems business, which saw operating margins rise to 6.7% from 4.2%, as HP held prices firm amid a favorable component environment. Revenues were up 1% for notebooks, 2% for desktops, and 6% for workstations. Overall personal systems segment revenues were up 2%, while units were up 4%, with notebooks up 2% and desktops up 7%. Printing segment revenue was down 7%, pressured by a 13% drop in consumer hardware and another 7% drop in supplies, which has been sliding in recent quarters as more customers choose ink and toner from third-party sellers. Commercial hardware was down 1%. For the April quarter, the company sees non-GAAP profits of 49 cents to 53 cents a share, below the Street at 54 cents, reflecting the near-term impact of coronavirus. HP sources many products in China. HP CFO Steve Fieler said in an interview that without the impact of the virus the guidance would have been above the Street consensus. For the fiscal year ending in October, HP lifted its non-GAAP profit forecast range to $2.33 to $2.43 a share, up from a previous range of $2.24 to $2.32. Fieler said that the higher guidance reflects the company's view that the impact from coronavirus will be temporary. The company also said it expects fiscal 2022 non-GAAP profits of $3.25 to $3.65 a share, which at the midpoint is more than $1 a share above the current Street consensus of $2.35 a share. The company didn't provide a 2021 outlook. The company said it expects $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in non-GAAP operating profit in FY 2022, with $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion in cumulative free cash flow in FY 2020, 2021 and 2022. The company expects $1.2 billion in structural cost reductions in fiscal 2022, with $650 million of that flowing through to non-GAAP operating profit. HP said it has revised its long-term operating model for its personal systems business, increasing the target operating margin to 5.5%, from 3.5%. For printers, the company is setting a long-term operating margin range of 16% to 18%. A spokesperson for Xerox said the company had no immediate comment on the announcements from HP.

The Topix index also declined 3.33% to end its trading day at 1,618.26. Shares of Fujifilm bucked the overall trend to gain 2.83% after local media reports that the Japanese government was considering the use of an anti-flu drug developed by a unit of the firm to treat the coronavirus. Shares in mainland China were mixed on the day, with the Shanghai composite shedding 0.6% to around 3,013.05 while the Shenzhen component added 0.71% to 11,856.08. The Shenzhen composite gained 0.507% to about 1,943.17. South Korea's Kospi closed 1.18% higher at 2,103.61, following sharp losses seen on Monday as the country witnessed a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in recent days. On Tuesday, the country reported 60 new cases, bringing the number of infected cases to 893, to become the country with the most cases outside mainland China. Total fatalities now stand at 8. Seoul raised the coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"" over the weekend. Shares of Korean Air Lines rose 1.58% on Tuesday despite the airline announcing Tuesday that a cabin crew member had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Reuters. Consumer confidence in South Korea dropped in February to a six-month low, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Tuesday.

The country's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad unexpectedly resigned on Monday, but reportedly agreed to stay on as interim leader until a successor is named. In afternoon trade on Tuesday, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index rose about 0.7%, after closing about 2.69% lower on Monday following news of the political upheaval. The country's central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia or BNM, said it was ""closely monitoring conditions in the financial markets"" after the latest political developments. ""While ringgit movements will continue to be market determined, BNM's market operations will ensure sufficient liquidity and orderly financial market conditions,"" it said in a statement. In China, where the outbreak was first reported, 508 new cases and 71 additional deaths were reported as of Feb. 24. That brings the country's total to 77,658 confirmed cases, and 2,663 deaths. Concerns over the economic impact of disruptions caused by the virus outbreak have sent jitters across markets in recent weeks as some factories in China continue to remain shut due to containment measures. Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Tuesday that China's first quarter GDP is expected to deteriorate ""very materially"" to only 2.8% while the full-year projection was at 5.5%.

""Even if the virus condition start(s) to get contained and we have real activities picking up in March, it's very difficult to see China having any material growth in the foreseeable future."" The outbreak in South Korea has also exacerbated concerns, given the country's importance in the global technology and semiconductor supply chains. ""We've already seen how the China factory shutdowns have affected industry in the rest of the region as they haven't been able to get the intermediate goods that feed into their ¦ production lines,"" said Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics. While the effect on South Korea won't be as broad, ""if they had to shut down factories across the country, then particularly the technology sector across the rest of the region who rely on Korea for things like ¦ liquid crystal displays and semiconducting chips, they would really struggle,"" Holmes told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. Outside of Asia, Italy has also seen a surge in the number of people infected, with at least 130 reported cases. ""The jump in cases outside of China raises the risk of a sharper Q1 2020 global economic slowdown,"" Kim Mundy, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note.

Fred Imbert@foimbertYun Li@YunLi626Michael Sheetz@thesheetztweetz,2/24/2020,cnbc,Stocks plunge for a second day as the Dow lost more than 800 points on Tuesday,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/stock-futures-are-flat-in-overnight-trading-following-the-dows-1000-point-rout.html,"The stock rout related to coronavirus fears continued Tuesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing nearly 900 points, adding to Monday's 1,000-point plunge. The S&P 500's two-day loss of 6.3% was the largest for the benchmark since August 2015. A combination of factors spooked investors and caused the Dow to turn negative after starting the session in positive territory, including a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield to a record low and comments from health officials warning of a possible outbreak in the U.S. The Dow dropped 879.44 points, or 3.1%, to 27,081.36 after being up more than 180 points at one point shortly after the open. The benchmark posted back-to-back losses of at least 800 points for the first time ever. The S&P 500 slid 3% to 3,128.21, posting back-to-back declines of 3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8% to 8,965.61, and turned negative for the year. Monday's session was the market's worst in two years. All in all, the S&P 500 lost $1.7 trillion in market value in two days, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""Volatility is normal,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""What's scary about this particular drop from the all-time high is it has snuck up on us so quickly in a short period of time."" ""When you juxtapose that against a mentality of 'we don't know how big this thing can get,' that makes it feel like it's a bottomless reaction in the market,"" Hogan said. These declines also put the Dow and S&P 500 about 8% below their record highs reached earlier this month. The Nasdaq closed 8.9% below its all-time high from Feb. 19. Technology stocks such Apple and Facebook have fallen into correction territory, down more than 10% from all-time highs hit just last month.  ""I understand the inclination to buy on the dip. I understand that the path of least resistance in this market is to bounce up ... but I stress, this is different,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and former Pimco CEO, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" U.S. equities dropped as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials briefed the U.S. on how to get ready if the coronavirus outbreak worsens domestically. ""We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a top official at CDC, told reporters on a conference call. Stocks fell even as top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow maintained that the coronavirus was contained so far in the U.S. and that economic growth had yet to be significantly affected. Traders were unnerved by the bond market, which pointed to slower economic growth around the world. The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 1.33%, hitting an all-time low. The 30-year U.S. bond yield also reached a record low. Bond prices move inversely to yields. ""With global investors chasing after U.S. assets, specifically fixed income, there's significant pressure on rates to stay low,"" said Andrew Thrasher, founder of Thrasher Analytics. ""This doesn't mean we won't see some countertrend moves in the 10-year, but the trend is well defined to the downside right now which is not one I'm overly eager to fight."" The drop in yields pushed bank stocks down. Bank of America fell more than 5% while JPMorgan Chase closed 4.5% lower. Citigroup and Wells Fargo declined by 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively. Lower rates could hit bank profit margins. The market plunge on Tuesday came after investors fled stocks on Monday as a surge in coronavirus cases outside of China intensified fears of a prolonged global economic slowdown. The Dow suffered its biggest point and percentage drop since February 2018 on Monday. The S&P 500 plunged 3.3%, also the worst drop in two years. With Monday's declines, the S&P 500 and the Dow both wiped out all of their 2020 gains. South Korean authorities have confirmed more than 900 cases within the country's borders. Meanwhile, Italy has been the worst affected country outside of Asia, with more than 200 reported cases. Iran also confirmed at least 12 deaths. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. remains small relative to other countries, but a strategist at Jefferies said that number could grow and further dampen investor sentiment. ""We increasingly find it hard to believe that USA cases are as low as reported, and believe that given the flow of Chinese, Korean and Iranian nationals into North America, a large USA community-based outbreak is increasingly likely,"" wrote Simon Powell, equity strategist at Jefferies. ""If not managed correctly, this could significantly rattle markets."" Mastercard warned about the potential impact the coronavirus will have on 2020 results, sending its shares down more than 6%. ""The huge jump over the weekend to various other countries has many reassessing 2020 growth estimates,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. ""We could see quickly decreasing earnings and growth outlooks."" Analysts have already begun cutting their earnings estimates for the first quarter. Data compiled by The Earnings Scout showed analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to contract by about 0.1% this quarter. Earlier this month, analysts expected growth of roughly 2.5%, the data showed.

Please see our Privacy Notice for details of your data protection rights. As more people are being diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus disease, global leaders are being warned of a potential pandemic. Professor in Medicine at Norwich Medical School Paul Hunter explained the earliest a reliable vaccine could be developed is late 2020 or early 2021. While speaking to BBC host Simon McCoy the medical expert claimed after a successful vaccine is developed, not everyone would be able to have it straightaway. He noted it will likely only be administered to those who were most vulnerable to the disease and the introduction of the vaccine is unlikely to stop the rapid infection rate of COVID-19. Mr McCoy asked: Will vaccines be available in time to prevent a full pandemic? We are talking days before that is going to be called now, aren't we? Mr Hunter answered: We don't know when the coronavirus goes past the point where we are no longer able to control it globally. DON'T MISS: Coronavirus: Expert issues outbreak warning for UK   I suspect the earliest we are going to see a reliable vaccine will be towards the very end of this year maybe early next year. It is certainly plausible that by then this disease would have burned itself out although personally I doubt that. I suspect the coronavirus will run well into next year if not beyond. Even with the early vaccines, there won't be enough vaccines to really affect the spread of the disease.  What will happen is that we will use those vaccines in the same way we use influenza vaccines. We will use the coronavirus vaccine to protect the most vulnerable. This will be the most elderly people and also medical and nursing staff who are going to be some of the most likely to get the illness. World Health Organisation (WHO) Director Tedros Adhanom attacked world leaders for inadequately preparing for a pandemic but spending billion on terrorist attack protection earlier this month. READ MORE:Coronavirus: WHO reveals major protective' measure to combat virus - INSIGHTEU law could prevent states stopping illness spread - INSIGHTCoronavirus panic: Italian supermarkets ravaged by residents - INSIGHT  He insisted a pandemic gone unchecked could prove more deadly and dangerous than any terrorist attack. He also claimed leaders needed to take the opportunity to intensify their efforts against the coronavirus before the situation becomes more dire outside of China. He said: We throw money at an outbreak and when it is over we forget about it and do nothing to prevent the next one. The world spends billions of dollars preparing for a terrorist attack but relatively little preparing for the attack of a virus. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general

WHO spokesperson Dr Margaret Harris insisted countries across the globe should be on alert to deal with the deadly disease. During an interview on Radio 4's Today Programme the WHO spokesperson was asked would anything change in the advice the specialised agency was giving if the organisation dubbed the deadly virus a pandemic. She answered: No it wouldn't, we have already said to everybody be on the alert and be ready. We are already making it clear and working very closely and strongly with a lot of countries to prepare. So, the very first thing we did when we knew we had this virus in our human population was identify the countries with the weakest health systems. This is because those countries will struggle to look after people with the severest illness so no it wouldn't really change anything. READ MORE: Coronavirus latest: Vaccine won't stop spread of deadly disease   Dr Harris added: We don't really get hung up on categories at the WHO. But the WHO is saying the coronavirus is beyond China and in other countries. We are concerned about that situation. The European Union has come under fire for their plan to deal with the coronavirus outbreak as more patients are confirmed to have the deadly virus.  Ally of Angela Merkel, Jens Spahn, hit out at the EU's policy that individual members states act independently in dealing with the crisis because it meant many would continue allowing freedom of movement. At a meeting of health ministers this month, he called on the EU to ""take responsibility"" and provide a plan for the bloc. He said: ""I would also like the World Health Organisation's request for financial aid to not only be answered by countries, but also that the EU takes on some responsibility with its own budgetary resources.""

At least 152 people have been infected with coronavirus in Italy with four people dying in the last two days.

Four of the Britons evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus after returning to the UK. Despite a series of checks by the Department of Health, new cases have developed leaving fellow passengers fearing for their own health. The passengers were relieved to be given the all clear and flown back after more than two weeks trapped on the cruise ship off Japan. However, health officials confirmed yesterday that tests at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral “ where 32 passengers were being quarantined “ showed four passengers had contracted the deadly strain of the coronavirus. The Department of Health said a full infectious disease risk assessment was carried out before the repatriation flight and nobody who boarded had displayed any symptoms. However, the new cases flown back from Japan have brought the UK total to 13, causing experts to fear a pandemic is on the horizon.   The latest cases to be confirmed were among the 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who were flown back to the UK on Saturday evening. Speaking to the Daily Mail, sources said that passengers were shocked by the news and that the two-week quarantine had got off to the worst possible start. Now, some of those on the flight back from Japan told of their fury about spending hours sat with infected people.

A worrying video showing a vast number of people queuing to buy face masks from a supermarket in South Korea has emerged. The queue stretched round several streets in Daegu which has sparked concerns about just how prepared the country is for the spread of coronavirus. Customers queued outside one of Daegu's E-mart stores, which began to sell face masks at half price in the city, according to local media reports. South Korea has raised its infectious disease alert level to its highest for the first time since 2009.   The drone shot sees panicked locals running to find their place in the queue before supplies run out. The Emart supermarket in the Chilseong district of the city is offering discounted masks for Daegu residents.

The elderly woman refused the test on the grounds she had not recently traveled abroad, according to The Guardian. Current estimates suggest that a single person with the novel coronavirus spreads the infection to about 2.2 additional people, on average. The Shincheonji church has announced that it had closed down all of its facilities nationwide. Officials announced: ""We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not traveled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general

At this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects [from the outbreak of COVID-19], but this new source of uncertainty is something I will be carefully monitoring, Mester said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics conference. I've incorporated it as a downside risk to my modal forecast, which calls for growth to continue at trend, slightly slower than the pace of last year, with continued healthy consumption growth and some pickup in investment spending, she added. Mester is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year. The rate-setting group will meet March 17-18. Many economists say the pace of growth of COVID-19 cases outside of China makes it more likely the Fed will have to cut interest rates in coming months from a current 1.50%-1.75% range. Many see a move as soon as April. Read: Fed would be tone-deaf' if it held rates steady The Fed cut rates three times in a row last year but has maintained an on-hold policy over the past several months. In her speech, Mester discussed calls for further easing that have come from economists who have separately argued it might help to boost inflation up to the Fed's 2% annual target. We have been undershooting our inflation goal for some time, so a natural question is whether policymakers should add even further accommodation to spur a faster return of inflation to our goal. I would not favor that at this time, Mester said. I am comfortable with our current stance of policy, she added. A patient approach to policy changes is appropriate unless there is a material change to the outlook, she said. Further easing has some risks, the Cleveland Fed president said, in the form of potential asset bubbles. Easing policy would raise the risk of generating imbalances that would threaten the expansion, she said. Even given the low level of interest rates, equity prices and commercial real-estate valuations are elevated; corporate debt levels are high; and underwriting standards on leveraged loans are weak, she said, saying this called for the Fed to remain attuned to financial market developments. U.S. equity benchmarks have fallen sharply on elevated coronavirus fears. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.04% plunged over 3.6% on Monday. Read: Dow is heading for its second-worst point drop ever In comments to reporters after her speech, Mester said the sharp market selloff was one day and the Fed should not overreact. We have to wait and see how things develop. You don't want to overreact to volatility in the market,  she said, adding that she wasn't worried the Fed would be too slow to react, if necessary, or what's known as being behind the curve. Mester said some of the risks facing the economy last year has eased, especially on the trade front. In its place, the risk from coronavirus has emerged. So far, that risk remains opaque. Contacts in the Cleveland Fed so far say the effect of the virus has been on the supply side and there has been no pullback in consumer demand. I see [the virus] as a risk to my outlook, but the fundamentals underlying the U.S. economy are still  strong enough to support trend growth, she said.",business
Greg Robb,2/24/2020,marketwatch,"Spread of coronavirus lifts odds for Fed rate cut, as inaction would be tone-deaf'",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spread-of-coronavirus-lifts-odds-for-fed-rate-cut-as-inaction-would-be-tone-deaf-2020-02-24?mod=article_inline,"Recent global developments, including the more rapid spread of the coronavirus outside of China, make it more likely the Federal Reserve will be forced soon to cut interest rates to respond to growth concerns, according to economists gathered for a top policy conference on Monday. I think they're going to have to go, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. Sitting still would be seen as being tone-deaf, Tannenbaum added. Fed officials have argued over the past several weeks that the coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was going to be a temporal problem that the U.S. economy would make up for later in the year. That recovery now seems like a remote possibility, Tannenbaum said. Instead of rebounding as hoped, the Chinese economy is a long way from being back on track to normalcy, Tannenbaum said. It is a matter of months, not weeks, before China is back at full production, he said. That means U.S. businesses that are heavily dependent on China for components, including AAPL, +2.65% and others, are going to burn though their inventory and be stuck, he said. Read: Coronavirus update, clusters emerge in Iran and Italy The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year due to worries about a recession. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, those recession risks had been declining. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said they would cut rates if they saw anything that would demand a material reassessment of their outlook for moderate growth. Traders who use fed-fund futures markets to forecast Fed actions put a 23% chance of a rate cut in March. Chances of a rate cut rise above 50% for April, according to the CME Group's Fed Watch tool . Fed officials are likely to modify their statements about the coronavirus in coming days, economists said. I think what you will hear are statements [from Fed officials] that are a lot less confident, Tannenbaum said. Julia Coronado, the president of Macro Policy Perspectives, said the Fed's next meeting on March 17-18 was probably too soon for a rate cut. Coronado said Fed officials would use the March meeting to signal a willingness to do what's needed and then take action at the April meeting. Krishna Guha, Fed watcher at Evercore ISI, said there was a chance the Fed will move as soon as March and if it does cut, that move will be more than 25 basis points. Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in a Yahoo Finance interview that there are downside risks from the coronavirus but added a V-shaped recovery was still possible if everything recovers by April. Former Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota argued in a Bloomberg Opnion column that the Fed should not wait even until the March meeting to cut interest rates of possibly 50 basis points. The virus could result in a significant worldwide economic slowdown and a rate cut is a cheap insurance policy for the economy that the Fed shouldn't pass up, he said.

Holly Ellyatt@HollyEllyatt,2/24/2020,cnbc,Coronavirus: Italy stocks plummet as virus prompts shutdown,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/italy-stocks-plummet-as-coronavirus-prompts-shutdown.html,"Italian stocks suffered their biggest daily decline since 2016 on Monday, as the euro zone's third-largest economy grappled with the largest coronavirus outbreak outside of Asia. European markets screeched lower with the FTSE MIB index closing down 5.43% at 23,427. Shares of Italian banks fell sharply while the stock of Juventus soccer club was briefly halted after falling 11%. There are widespread concerns over the spread of the virus in northern Italy; the country now has over 220 confirmed cases, and local media reported a seventh death due to the virus as of Monday afternoon, with a sharp spike in cases over the weekend. The government has placed around a dozen towns in the north under quarantine with the wealthy regions of Lombardy and Veneto ” where the cities of Milan and Venice are located respectively ” the focus of the rise in coronavirus cases. The regions make up around 30% of Italy's economic output, while the majority of the quarantined towns are just south of the financial hub of Milan. Schools, museums, universities and cinemas have been closed while other public events, including Serie A soccer matches, have been canceled. Milan's opera house, La Scala, canceled performances and while Giorgio Armani's fashion show went ahead as part of Milan Fashion Week, no buyers or media were present. Venice's world-famous Carnival, which attracts thousands of visitors every year, was due to end on Tuesday but was cut short on Sunday as the government introduced ""urgent measures"" to contain the virus, including restricting access in and out of affected areas. It's reported that the measures are affecting around 50,000 inhabitants. The virus will be another blow to Italy's already weak economy which is only expected to grow 0.5% in 2020, according to Bank of Italy forecasts made in December. Earlier in February, and before the virus hit the country, the bank warned that the coronavirus could have a significant impact on the Italian economy. Austria is reportedly considering border controls with Italy, having already suspended train services across the border. On Sunday evening, Austria refused entry to a train coming from Italy after the Italian State Railways informed Austrian train operator OBB that there were two people with fever symptoms on board, Sky News reported. The suspension of train services was later lifted, however. Meanwhile, concerns over the virus and quarantine measures have prompted panic-buying with Twitter users showing various supermarkets in the north with empty shelves. Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported Monday that latex gloves, hand disinfectant gel and bleach products were in short supply as inhabitants sought to protect themselves.   Italy's authorities have scrambled to contain the spread of the virus but the head of the country's Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, conceded Sunday that it was still trying to find ""patient zero,"" the first carrier of the virus in the country. ""We still cannot identify patient zero, so it's difficult to forecast possible new cases,"" Borrelli told a press conference. The World Health Organization is sending a special mission to Italy Tuesday to try to track down more details on the source of the infections. Christian Lindmeier, spokesperson for the WHO, told CNBC Monday that the organization was worried about the ""pockets"" of outbreak seen in certain countries like Italy, Iran and South Korea. ""What we have been warning about, or warning against, and what we have been worried about, is exactly what we see now, that some countries across the world see pockets of this virus popping up and everyday life is being disrupted ... by something that we don't yet know what it is exactly, and that is scary,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" Paolo Gentiloni, European commissioner for the economy and a former prime minister of Italy, told CNBC Sunday that ""there is absolutely no reason for panic."" ""There is a reason to have confidence in institutions and Italian authorities. They know the situation. They are taking the good measures. So the European Union is perfectly confident on what the Italians are doing. But I repeat, there is no reason for panic.""",finance
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,2/24/2020,bbc,Coronavirus: North Korea quarantines foreigners,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51609360,"North Korea has quarantined 380 foreigners in an attempt to stop the coronavirus from breaking out. The foreigners are mostly diplomats stationed in the capital Pyongyang, state media reported. About 200 foreigners had already been confined to their compounds for the past 30 days - but as that came to an end, the quarantine has been extended. North Korea has not reported any cases of Covid-19, but several other countries did so on Monday. Afghanistan and Dubai said they had detected their first cases, and Kuwait said three people returning from Iran had been infected. In South Korea, seven people have died with 763 people infected. Around 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were infected. The virus, which emerged in China, has spread to at least 29 countries. Italy has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 152. Around 50,000 people in two northern ""hotspot"" regions - Veneto and Lombardy - have been put under quarantine for two weeks. Iran has also confirmed 43 cases of the virus and eight deaths. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged, the authorities earlier announced that some non-residents would be allowed to leave if they showed no symptoms of the virus. However, local officials now say that order was made without authorisation and has been revoked. The city has been in lockdown since January 23, with authorities cutting off transport links in and out of the city. More than 2,500 people have died from the virus in mainland China, with some 77,150 cases confirmed cases reported. North Korea has not confirmed any cases but the country shares a long and often porous border with China. There are concerns that North Korea, which is subject to international sanctions, lacks the health infrastructure to test and treat those infected and that any outbreak could quickly spread unchecked. At the moment, all foreigners coming into the country must be quarantined for 30 days. There are relatively few foreigners in North Korea, and only around 200 Westerners, according to one expert. North Korean authorities have also cancelled the annual Pyongyang marathon, which typically sees people from all over the world participating. Around 3,000 people in North Pyongan province - a north-western region bordering China - are also now under monitoring for reportedly showing suspected symptoms, said state media. South Korea has the largest number of confirmed cases outside China, after a huge spike in the past week. Before last Wednesday, the country had recorded just 31 cases. That number has now jumped to 763. Eight new cases of the virus have been reported in the army, and one in the navy, air force and marine corps - bringing the number to 11. But the biggest virus clusters have been linked to a hospital and a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu. A handful of South Korea airlines, including Korean Air Lines - the country's biggest airline - has suspended flights going to Daegu, which has a population of around 2.5m. Korean Air says the suspension will last until March 27. 20 Jan - 24 Feb Italian officials have introduced sweeping measures to control what is now the worst outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe - at least three people have died and more than 150 cases confirmed. In the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, a lock-down is in place in several small towns. For the next two weeks, 50,000 residents will not be able to leave without special permission. Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelled - including several top-flight football matches. Officials have yet to find the first carrier of the virus in the country. Analysis by Fergus Walsh, medical correspondent The combined situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy points to the early stages of pandemic. This means a global outbreak, with the coronavirus spreading in the community in multiple parts of the world. In each of these countries we are seeing spread of the virus with no connection to China. The lockdown efforts in Italy mirror those that have happened in China. The situation in Iran is especially worrying, because the health authorities have reportedly said the virus has spread to multiple cities, and it appears the first case in Lebanon is linked to a traveller from Iran. If we have a pandemic, it will still be important to limit the speed of spread of the virus. If countries could hold it somewhat at bay until the end of winter, there is a hope that warmer temperatures will reduce the time the virus can survive in the air, as we see with seasonal flu. But this may not be certain. Iran said on Sunday it had 43 confirmed cases of the virus, most of them in the holy city of Qom. Eight of those infected have died, the highest number of deaths outside China. Iraq, Pakistan, Armenia and Turkey have closed their borders with Iran, and Afghanistan has suspended air and road travel to and from Iran. China's President Xi Jinping has described the outbreak as the ""largest public health emergency"" in the country's recent history. Speaking on Sunday, he acknowledged ""shortcomings"" in China's response and said lessons must be learned. China reported 409 new infections on Monday, the bulk of which were from Wuhan. But outside China, cases with no clear link to that country or other confirmed cases continue to rise, prompting concern from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The South Korean band are due to film several TV shows in Seoul this week, marking the release of their latest album, Map Of The Soul: 7. In an email to fan club members, they said the shows would go ahead, but without a studio audience. Earlier on Monday, the band streamed a press conference from a virtually empty hall due to fears over the virus. ""Health is always on our minds these days, and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself are ultimately only possible when you're healthy,"" said singer Jimin, ""Especially since it is very risky outside these days. I hope you take care of yourself"". The band continued to answer pre-selected questions from journalists at the event, which took place in Seoul. ""We have decided to fully co-operate with the government's policy to refrain from holding events with a massive number of participants in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus,"" said BTS's management in a statement. ""We would like to advise fans to refrain from visiting the venue of the press conference for your own safety, and ask you to support BTS by watching the press conference via livestreaming."" Seven people have died from coronavirus in South Korea, with more than 760 infected. About 7,700 troops have been quarantined after 11 military members were diagnosed with the disease. South Korean broadcasters recently took the decision to uninvite audiences from their shows to help contain the outbreak. BTS will still appear on the K-Pop chart show MCountdown, scheduled for broadcast on 27 February; and Inkigayo, a Top Of The Pops-style programme filmed in Seoul every Sunday, despite the lack of an audience. The high profile ""SBS Super Concert""m which featured BTS alongside fellow K-pop stars Zico, NCT 127 and Cherry Bullet, had previously been postponed following the outbreak of coronavirus in the southeastern city of Daegu. The Korean Music Awards, where BTS were nominated for artist of the year and song of the year, has also been cancelled. Winners will now be announced online on 27 February. In an email, BTS apologised to their fans who had been ""looking forward to attending the shows"", adding: ""Thank you for understanding"". Coronavirus has had a big effect on the entertainment industry in Asia, with multiple acts cancelling their tours. Stormzy postponed dates in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia next month; while K-pop band Got7 cancelled three stadium shows in Thailand and Singapore. The Chinese premiere of the latest James Bond film, No Time To Die, has also been scrapped; while participation in this weekend's Tokyo Marathon has been restricted to the elite field of 176 athletes and 30 wheelchair athletes. Despite scaling back their promotional plans, BTS's latest album is expected to top the charts around the world this week. The album amassed pre-orders of 4.02 million copies, according to their record label, Big Hit Entertainment. That would make it the world's biggest-selling album since Ed Sheeran's Divide in 2017, based on pre-sales alone. In the UK, the Official Charts Company said Map Of The Soul: 7 was outselling its nearest three rivals combined, all-but-guaranteeing it the number one slot on Friday. BTS will appear on Jimmy Fallon and James Corden's US chat shows this week before their Korean TV specials. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Eleven towns across Lombardy, where the outbreak emerged suddenly on Friday, and Veneto have been quarantined for at least the next 15 days as Italian authorities scramble to contain the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe and the third worst in the world. The seven dead, the overwhelming majority were elderly people who had also been suffering from other health issues. The latest victim was an 80-year-old man in Milan. About 50,000 residents in the towns under lockdown have been told to stay at home and avoid social contact, while schools, shops and businesses “ apart from chemists and some supermarkets “ have been closed. Residents are allowed to manoeuvre within the red zone, for example going from one quarantined town to another to reach a supermarket that is permitted to stay open, but they are not allowed to leave the quarantined territory. People are also banned from entering the area, with transgressors facing fines, unless they are health workers or those delivering essential supplies. The centre of the outbreak is Codogno, the Lombardy town of almost 16,000 people where the first locally transmitted case in Italy, that of a 38-year old man, was detected. It's a surreal situation, Enrico Bianchi, who owns a veterinary pharmacist, told the Guardian. People are locked in their houses for fear of going out. It is really strange to go around the town, the few people around are wearing masks. Rosanna Ferrari, a farm owner, said: We're experiencing a bit of a panic. Supermarkets have been stormed since last Friday. There are queues outside of the chemist. They said they'll come, house to house, to collect saliva samples today. My daughter was in contact with some friends of the first person to be infected in Codogno. Those friends resulted negative. But still, we are worried. The first victim of coronavirus was Adriano Trevisan, a 77-year-old from the Veneto town of Vo' Euganeo, who died in hospital while being treated for pneumonia. One resident of the town of about 3,000 people, who asked not to be named, said: We're waiting to be tested, all we can do is stay at home and wait and wait. This is a flu, but if it's left it can create problems, especially for older people. The 38-year-year old who was first identified as being infected is in intensive care at a hospital in Codogno. He lives in nearby Castiglione d'Adda and plays in an amateur football team in Somaglia. Both towns are under lockdown and his teammates all underwent tests. We are three days into the quarantine and there is a rigid system in place, said Angelo Caperdoni, the mayor of Somaglia, a town of about 3,800 residents. It was difficult to contain the panic at first, especially as a lot of false news was circulating on social media that people believed to be true. There is still panic regarding food provisions. Many people went to Codogno yesterday to try and stock up. Franco Stefanoni, the mayor of Fombio, also under lockdown, said the town's two mini-markets had been besieged. The important thing is to maintain calm, he said. People have been racing to the supermarket to buy 20kg of pasta or 30kg of bread. But if the shop is restocked and open for the next few days, there is no need to exaggerate. The virus has affected seven of Italy's wealthiest regions: Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria and Trentino. Milan's stock exchange plunged 4.5% on Monday as the country's economic engine almost ground to a halt after cases of the illness were confirmed in the city, home to about 3.1 million people. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case “ about as serious as a regular cold “ and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. Schools and universities have been closed across the regions and people have been advised to work from home. Museums have also been closed, and festivities, concerts and sporting events cancelled, along with Church masses. More than 3,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out over the last few days, although authorities are still trying to identity patient zero “ the person who brought the virus to the region. The first man infected, a researcher at Unilever, came down with symptoms after attending a dinner at which there was a colleague who had recently returned from China, who tested negative for the virus. The peak in Italy is partly due to all the tests being done, said Roberta Siliquini, a former president of Italy's higher health council. We have found positive cases in people who probably had few or no symptoms and who may have overcome the virus without even knowing it. The Italian government has been criticised for hastily cancelling flights to and from China as, without coherence across Europe, people have been able to fly to other European cities and enter Italy from there.",general
"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-giuffrida,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones",2/24/2020,theguardian,"World is approaching coronavirus tipping point, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/world-is-approaching-coronavirus-tipping-point-experts-say,"The world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the coronavirus, according to experts, who warn that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it, after major outbreaks forced Italy and Iran to introduce stringent internal travel restrictions and South Korea's president placed the country on red alert. Some of the countries most affected by the virus are scrambling to halt its progress two days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said the international community needed to act quickly before the narrowing window of opportunity closed completely. With almost 78,000 cases of Covid-19 now confirmed across the globe, experts say the situation will soon reach a critical threshold. In 11 north Italian towns, 50,000 people have been in lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. In Iran, the authorities have ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces as a preventative measure. On Sunday, South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on red alert after it reported its sixth death and more than 600 infections. And four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers flown to the UK on Saturday have tested positive for Covid-19, the Chief Medical Officer for England said on Sunday. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13. While the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and an authority on the new coronavirus infection, echoed Tedros's warning and said the time for containing the disease was running out. The director general of the WHO has recently spoken of a narrowing of the window of opportunity to control the current epidemic, he said. The tipping point after which our ability to prevent a global pandemic ends seems a lot closer after the past 24 hours. Hunter said that while cases were declining in China, where the outbreak began, the weekend had seen some extremely concerning developments elsewhere. He said the surge in South Korean cases had been unprecedented so far in the epidemic, adding: The identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to be quite a few more cases identified in the next few days. Hunter also said the situation in Iran could have major implications for the Middle East. A further problem with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region, he said. Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, pointed out that case numbers in Italy had doubled between Friday and Saturday. This is an important stage of the coronavirus outbreak, he said. Fast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed. Two people have died from the virus in Italy since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 40 miles south-east of Milan. Those living in the affected areas now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival were cancelled and Milan fashion week was also affected. Iran has recorded eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital, Tehran, seven in the city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said. Pakistan responded by closing its land border with Iran, while Afghanistan said it was suspending travel to Iran to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and protect the public. Turkey also closed its borders and said it would halt incoming flights, adding that all motorways and railways at the border would be shut on Sunday afternoon. Jordan, meanwhile, will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly outbreak. Announcing his decision to raise South Korea's alert level on Sunday, Moon said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take unprecedented, powerful measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by regulations. As his country struggled to contain theoutbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as a very important moment, the news agency Yonhap said. Of the 123 new cases, 75 were related to the Shincheonji church in Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city, and a neighbouring hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers had been screened for the virus. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. The raising of the alert level came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country's management of the outbreak. Warning that China's virus epidemic was still grim and complex, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called on Sunday for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting the spring planting of crops.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anne-davies,2/24/2020,theguardian,Crown inquiry told Australia has less-stringent controls on casino junkets than elsewhere,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/crown-inquiry-told-australia-less-stringent-controls,"An inquiry into allegations of money laundering at Crown Resorts Melbourne casino has heard that other jurisdictions have far more stringent controls on junkets which bring high rollers to casinos. On the first day of evidence in a NSW inquiry, a gaming expert, Paul Bromberg from Spectrum Asia, said that other countries such as Singapore “ and US gaming states such as New Jersey “ required junket operators to be licensed. Japan had decided to ban them operating in casinos entirely. The inquiryis being chaired by the former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin and is examining allegations of money laundering and links to organised crime in Crown. She is also considering whether there are probity issues raised by Lawrence Ho's Melco Resorts' purchase of 10% of Crown's shares. Reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age last year alleged that Crown Resorts, part-owned by one of Australia's richest men, James Packer, was using junkets backed by Asia's most powerful organised crime syndicates as part of its program to attract Chinese high rollers to its casinos. Reports also alleged that Crown's casinos were used to launder money. Bromberg told the inquiry there was substantial work by academics which linked Macau's junkets “ organisations which bring high rollers to overseas casinos “ to the triads. Bromberg said that as well as organising travel, junket operators arranged prostitutes and narcotics for their clientele and also provided cross-border finance and enforced debts. The enforcement of gaming debts is illegal in China. For all these reasons, organised crime has been involved in junkets for many years, he said. He said there had been reports in the Hong Kong media about the organised crime connections of Suncity, including the CEO, Alvin Chau. The allegations drew a sharp response from Crown, which ran advertisements in newspapers calling the reports a deceitful campaign. Crown pointed to registration of junkets by the gaming authorities in Macau and the fact that the largest junket Crown was involved with, Suncity, is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. But Bromberg, a veteran of the Asian gaming scene, said the fact that Macau registered junket operators offered little comfort. He said until recently Macau had failed to enforce its own gaming legislation and that registration was very different from enforcement. Macau merely required junket operators to certify that they had no foreign criminal connections, without doing its own checks, he said. Asked what comfort could be gained by a junket like Suncity being listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Bromberg replied: I would say very little. He said that apart from limited financial scrutiny, the HK stock exchange did not have the resources for probity checks of any companies listed on its bourse, and that applied equally to companies not in the gaming industry. On the other hand, Singapore, which opened its first two casinos in 2010, required junkets to be licensed, he said. Its regulator, which has the powers of a law enforcement body, had rejected several junket operators because they did not meet probity checks, he said. Bromberg said Japan had gone further and taken the decision not to allow junkets to operate in its gaming industry. Australian casinos are required to notify the state casino authorities if they are using junkets to promote their casino or allowing them to operate within the casino. But the authorities do not run probity checks on the junkets, leaving that function to the casino itself. Bromberg said this clearly gave rise to a potential conflict of interest, as the casino was wanting to bring as many wealthy VIPs to its casino as possible. Also he pointed out that casinos did not have access to information gathered by other law enforcement agencies. The regulation of Macau's gaming scene is particularly relevant to Crown because Macau's Melco Resorts, chaired by Lawrence Ho, has bought a 10% stake in Crown. However, Ho recently announced he would not proceed to buy a further 10% from Packer due to the downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Packer is expected to give evidence in the second part of the inquiry in March.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-doherty,2/24/2020,theguardian,How will Australia respond if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/how-will-australia-respond-if-the-coronavirus-outbreak-becomes-a-pandemic,"As cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic is very likely, if not inevitable. Some say the world is already in the early stages of a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as a disease spreading across two continents. Clusters of Covid-19 “ the illness caused by the novel coronavirus (officially known as Sars-CoV-2) “ are emerging all over the world, with some showing no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started and how they have spread. Globally, there have been 78,973 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 2,466 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths have been in mainland China, centred around central Hubei province. How does a country like Australia, geographically remote and with a limited number of mild cases “ all of which have been traced back to their origin “ counter a pandemic? Under the Australian government's Emergency Response Plan for Covid-19, the initial action response when cases are first identified in Australia is focused on minimising transmission and managing initial cases. It involves border measures such as health screenings at airports and ports, escalating to travel bans, which are currently in place for travellers from mainland China. Confirmed cases are tracked backwards to find points of infection, and potential contacts “ such as fellow passengers on flights “ alerted to the potential that they have been exposed to the disease. Those who have been exposed to suspected cases are asked to self-isolate at home. Citizens and permanent residents returning from known hotspots face periods of enforced quarantine. If, and as, cases escalate, hospitals can be advised to consider bringing in additional surge staff and state governments asked to consider establishing fever clinics or other alternative models of care to minimise the burden on the health system. Places where outbreaks could spread especially rapidly, or could impact upon vulnerable populations “ residential aged care facilities, schools and prisons “ can be given extra support and staff to investigate and manage outbreaks. Australia's Covid-19 plan draws from the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, which contemplates a novel coronavirus from which the Australian population would have little immunity. Currently, there are no effective anti-virals available and there is no vaccine. Availability of a customised novel coronavirus vaccine would be the greatest tool in reducing the impact. It is still not known if or when this might be available, the emergency response plan reads, noting that there is still no vaccine available for the other major coronaviruses Sars and Mers. Government-directed social distancing measures may increase from reactively “ or, if necessary, preemptively “ closing schools if it appears children are particularly susceptible; encouraging, or potentially mandating, workplace closures and working from home; and cancelling large public events. And Australia will also attempt to insulate itself from any growing pandemic with increasing travel advisories for countries that are experiencing significant outbreaks. Already, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised the travel advisory for China to the highest level: Do Not Travel, and told its citizens already in the country they should leave the country as soon as they are able. On Monday, the Australian government raised its travel advice for both South Korea and Japan. Based on advice from Australia's chief medical officer, we now recommend you exercise a high degree of caution'... due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19), Dfat said of both countries. Risk communication experts Jody Lanard and Peter Sandman have argued that with the rise in cases globally, it's a good time to think about how to use the P-word' (pandemic) in talking about Covid-19. The most crucial (and overdue) risk communication task for the next few days is to help people visualise their communities when keeping it out' “ containment “ is no longer relevant. The P word is a good way to launch this message. Lanard and Sandman say there are measures individuals can take to prepare for and deal with a potential global outbreak. They advise people with medical conditions to get ahead on prescriptions if possible in case of very predictable supply chain disruptions, and so they won't have to go out to the pharmacy at a time when there may be long lines of sick people. Lanard and Sandman also recommend people slowly starting to stock up on non-perishable food to last their households through several weeks of social distancing at home during an intense wave of transmission in their community. And the example we like the best, because it gives every single person an immediate action that they can take over and over: right now, today, start practicing not touching your face when you are out and about! You probably won't be able to do it perfectly, but you can greatly reduce the frequency of potential self-inoculation. You can even institute a buddy system, where friends and colleagues are asked to remind each other when someone scratches her eyelid or rubs his nose. The government's emergency response plan says Australia is well placed globally to respond to any widespread outbreak, but that the risks should not be under-estimated. The novel coronavirus outbreak represents a significant risk to Australia. It has the potential to cause high levels of morbidity and mortality and to disrupt our community socially and economically. This month, the Australian government updated its Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). The plan outlines a staged response to a worsening pandemic: Australia is currently in the initial action stage. The emergency response plans says impact of the outbreak will be determined by: the clinical severity of the outbreak (how severe cases are, and many people need to be hospitalised) its transmissibility (how easily it is spread, currently it has a preliminary reproduction number of 1.4 to 2.5) the capacity of the health system to treat infected patients the effectiveness of interventions to treat the illness or stop it spreading Victoria's chief health minister, Dr Brett Sutton, said all Australian states, along with the commonwealth government, have been working on pandemic preparedness for weeks. It's clear that with local transmission in several countries a pandemic is very likely, if not inevitable. We are working rapidly on planning and surge with our health sector. We've provided guidance to practitioners and many communications materials but are now focused on the models of care that will need to be in place “ clinics, phone triage, home care, right through to ICU and aged care. Victoria and Australia nonetheless remain completely in containment mode, Sutton said, identifying any possible case; isolating those who are infectious; and quarantining contacts. Regardless of developments internationally, this gives all of us time and space to plan and prepare.",general
"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason",2/24/2020,theguardian,Government to shut schools in event of UK coronavirus outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/government-to-shut-schools-if-there-was-uk-coronavirus-outbreak,"Emergency planners would consider temporarily shutting schools in affected areas if there was a sudden surge in coronavirus cases in any part of the UK, as part of contingency plans being drawn up by the government. Department of Health sources pointed to official advisory documents, which suggest that school closures could not only potentially protect children from infection but reduce the overall transmission of the virus across the population. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. The government's Influenza Pandemic Strategy says using a precautionary approach, directors of public health may advise localised closures of schools to reduce the initial spread of infection locally. However, more dramatic measures such as cutting off local populations “ as the Italian government has done in northern Lombardy and Veneto “ or closing down travel routes will only be considered as an unlikely last resort, sources added. Questions about the British government's readiness were given extra urgency after events in Italy in recent days. The country reported an unexpected upsurge in cases. It has, at 219, the most in recorded in Europe. The Italian authorities have decided to introduce stringent restrictions, including a curfew in 11 affected towns in the north of the country, as well as wider travel restrictions. Schools, museums and cinemas have been closed. No 10 said at lunchtime it was planning for all eventualities if the number of coronavirus cases were to lift off similarly in the UK “ although the prime minister's spokesman said the risk to the British public remained low at present. We are well prepared for UK cases. We are using tried and tested procedures to prevent further spread and the NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections, the spokesman said. The Department of Health believes it will be not until about May that it will be clearer what impact the virus is having on the UK, the rough estimated timescale between any initial arrival of the disease and its fullest extent. So far, however, there have been only a handful of British cases. There have been 13 positive tests for coronavirus during the current outbreak in the country so far, while some Britons returning from China were quarantined for a fortnight in a hospital in the Wirral, near Liverpool. Shutting down movement within the UK is seen as counterproductive, according to the official plan being followed by the department. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the impact of internal travel restrictions on transmission and it concludes that for these reasons, the working presumption will be that government will not impose any such restrictions on travel in a pandemic situation. Public gatherings are also unlikely to be restricted because there is very limited evidence that restrictions on mass gatherings will have any significant effect on influenza virus transmission. Crowded places are an important indicator of normality' and may help maintain public morale during a pandemic. A pandemic virus could kill about 2.5% of the people it infects, a total of 750,000 people in the UK, according to the Department of Health. But emergency planners around the country are supposed to have drawn up contingency plans for a realistic worst-case scenario, which involves managing an illness that kills between 210,000 and 315,000 Britons. Expert estimates, cited by the World Health Organization on Monday, indicate the death rate in Wuhan, the the Chinese city at the centre of the virus, is between 2% and 4% “ but more widely across China the figure is at 0.7%. Similar responses and planning mechanisms are used to deal with civil unrest, chemical and nuclear incidents, all relying on the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, which staffs the emergency planning Cobra system. If necessary, ministers could deploy emergency martial law style powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, although few think it will come close to being necessary.",general

England are due to face Italy in Rome on 14 March on the final day of the Six Nations but there are already doubts over Italy's match against Ireland in Dublin a week earlier. The Irish health minister said on Monday that the fixture needs considerable consideration. The Italian rugby federation has also postponed all matches, from elite to grassroots level, this weekend and suspended all gatherings of its national teams in the affected regions. Postponed matches would mean the Six Nations is forced into at least one extra week, or fixtures could have to be played considerably later. That could wreak havoc, with France, England and Ireland still harbouring hopes of winning the title. In 2001 one match was played in September and two in October owing to the disruption caused by the spread of foot and mouth disease. Ireland's minister for health, Simon Harris, said: The rugby game is something that needs considerable consideration. This situation is evolving. The weekend's activities have shown there is still an awful lot unknown about the coronavirus and about the path it might take. There will be some big decisions in the coming days. Most particularly, I'm thinking of the Ireland-Italy game. Two Pro14 matches “ Ospreys' match against Zebre in Parma and Ulster's trip to Treviso to play Benetton “ have been called off. To ensure the safety of our players and spectators Pro14 Rugby fully supports the preventative measures taken in Italy, read a statement. On Sunday, all sporting events in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto were postponed, including the women's Six Nations match between Italy and Scotland. Several towns in the areas are under lockdown. While England's men's side face Italy in Rome next month, both the women's and under-20 matches are scheduled for those affected regions. The Six Nations is monitoring this situation very closely and is in regular contact with the [Italian federation] and all other unions and federations as well as the relevant local authorities and health organisations, read a statement from the tournament organisers. Mauro Vegni, the head of the race organisation for several top Italian cycling events including the Giro d'Italia, which is scheduled to start on 9 May in Budapest, said he was concerned the virus could affect the Milan‘San Remo race next month. Like everyone, we are concerned by what's happening, he told Cycling News. At the same time we hope that, with time, the situation will improve and that the number of cases will not increase. Milan-San Remo is the one that worries me the most, he added. At the moment there's no plan B for Milan‘San Remo. It would make no sense to cut three quarters of the race. We can only follow the lead from the government. We still have three weeks until Milan‘San Remo. South Korea's K-league has postponed the start of its football season, which had been due to kick off this weekend.

A New York jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty. The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court found Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The count carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years. The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him raping a woman in a New York hotel in 2013. Weinstein was acquitted of three further charges, including the count of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The guilty verdict could have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted. The New York district attorney's office took an enormous gamble in how they set up the trial. Prosecutors chose as main accusers two women, both of whom continued to have close “ and at times sexual “ contact with Weinstein after they were attacked. ' Evangelical churches with strong links to Western Australian Liberals have won almost $40,000 in grants in the past four months through a federal scheme. The churches won funding through the Stronger Communities program, which allocates grants only to organisations that have been formally invited by the local federal MP. The True North church in Perth's northern suburbs was awarded $11,000 in November to upgrade its kitchen. The church sits in the federal division of Moore, held for the Liberals by Ian Goodenough. A grant for $5,500 went to the evangelical One church, also in Perth's outer northern suburbs, for new carpets. One of the church's founding pastors is Trish Botha, who worked in Goodenough's office until she left to run as a Senate candidate for the Liberals at last year's federal election. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of an outbreak of the coronavirus, as Italy reported six deaths and officials across the Middle East and Europe scrambled to limit its spread. On Monday, an Iranian lawmaker from Qom “ a Shia holy city 120km south of the capital, Tehran “ accused the health minister of lying about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. The country's deputy health minister rejected the report. More than 20% of Australia's forests burned during the summer's bushfire catastrophe, a proportion scientists believe is unprecedented globally, according to new research. China's number two diplomat in Australia made an appearance on last night's Q&A program on the ABC, where he described China's Uighur detention camps as training centres whose residents are mostly there voluntarily, and defended footage showing people suspected of having coronavirus being forcibly pushed into vans as justified.

How will Australia respond if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic? As cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China, health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic is very likely, if not inevitable.

But while the overall rate of underemployment remains a major concern, the experience for older workers highlights how the problem has changed and has gone from one mostly applied to younger workers to one that those nearing retirement are dealing with more than ever before ¦ Workers entering the final stage of their employment life are not only having to deal with a higher retirement age than they assumed they would have when they began work, they are now much more likely to be struggling to get as much work as they desire. Manchester City's fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jennifer-rankin,2/24/2020,theguardian,Austria to stop those suspected of carrying coronavirus at border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/austria-looks-at-italy-border-controls-in-bid-to-contain-coronavirus,"Austria has said it will stop people suspected of carrying the coronavirus from crossing its border, after parts of northern Italy were put into lockdown over the weekend following a surge in cases. The Austrian government released a travel warning for affected places in Lombardy and Veneto, following a meeting of the government's coronavirus taskforce that included the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. As far as the borders and cross-border traffic are concerned, we will proceed as follows: we will further tighten warning systems with our neighbours; [and] we will immediately order a stop in the event of suspected cases, as happened last night, Kurz said on Monday. Austria suspended train services to and from Italy for about four hours on Sunday evening to test two passengers for the coronavirus. The train, carrying about 300 passengers from Venice to Munich, was stopped on the Italian side of the Brenner pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two passengers tested negative. Government sources said this did not amount to a reintroduction of border controls inside the European Union's passport-free Schengen zone. There are no general border controls. Right now we don't think that is the way forward, an Austrian diplomat said. If we do have a confirmed case, then we will check that again. Austrian travellers in affected parts of northern Italy are being advised to avoid crowds and follow instructions of local authorities. Italian authorities have said they will impose fines on anyone entering or leaving restricted areas. By Monday, the number of cases of the virus in Italy had risen to 229 and six people had died. Health ministers from Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia and Croatia are due to attend a meeting in Rome on Tuesday to discuss containing the virus. Italy's government is urging its neighbours not to impose border controls, which it argues would be ineffective. As Italy's government scrambles to deal with the outbreak, which has led to police patrolling 11 towns and the cancellation of Venice carnival, the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini seized on the issue by making a link with migration. The government has underestimated the coronavirus, he told a press conference in Genoa. Allowing the migrants to land from Africa, where the presence of the virus was confirmed, is irresponsible. Africa has so far had only one confirmed case of Covid-19, in Egypt. The European commission announced on Monday it would send experts to Italy from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, in a joint mission with the World Health Organization. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case “ about as serious as a regular cold “ and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. The EU executive also announced a β‚¬232m (Β£195m) package to deal with the virus, although some of the funds have yet to be signed off. Earlier on Monday the commission said that any suspension of free movement within the 26-country EU free-travel zone should be based on a credible risk assessment and scientific evidence. We are facing ¦ an unfolding situation, a complex situation and any decisions made need to be based on risk assessment and scientific advice, and need to be proportionate, said Stella Kyriakides, EU commissioner for health and food safety. We stress that for the moment WHO has not advised changing or imposing restrictions on either travel or trade. A commission spokesman said: Right now, our advice does not include border controls. Governments in the passport-free Schengen zone can reintroduce border controls if there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security. European commission guidance states that controls at internal borders should remain an exceptional measure of last resort. Border controls have been reintroduced and prolonged more than 50 times since September 2015, as governments have responded to large numbers of migrants and asylum seekers arriving in the EU, as well as terrorist threats. France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway are among the countries that have notified Brussels of continuing border controls in response to terrorist threats. Both Spain and Poland enforced border controls when their countries were hosting UN climate talks, in 2019 and 2018 respectively. Countries can impose border controls for up to six months for foreseeable events, such as international meetings or sporting championships, or for up to two years in exceptional circumstances. At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, eight countries reintroduced border checks, prompting fears that the passport-free zone was on the brink of collapse. EU officials stressed that the decision to reintroduce border controls lay in the hands of national governments. It is important that member states fully respect the advice given from WHO and of course from ECDC, but such decisions concerning travel restrictions will always be member states' competence and member states' decisions, Kyriakides said. Nearly half the β‚¬232m EU aid package will go to WHO to boost preparedness in countries with poorer health systems. Smaller portions of money have been allocated to African health experts to ensure rapid diagnosis of the disease (β‚¬10m), as well as repatriation flights for EU citizens from Wuhan (β‚¬3m), the origin of the outbreak.",general

Shares came under heavy selling pressure in key markets as analysts warned that the threat of tougher quarantine measures outside China to prevent the spread of the disease would hit company profits by hitting supply chains and consumer demand. Investors rushed to buy safe haven investments such as gold to protect against steep losses on the stock markets, sending the price of the precious metal to a seven-year high of $1,683 (Β£1,303) an ounce. US stock markets had their worst day in two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 1,000 points, or about 3%, in New York as investors in the world's largest economy priced in the possibility of a deeper global economic shock. In a note to investors Goldman Sachs cut its US growth forecast from 1.4% to just 1.2% for the first quarter. An increasing amount of companies [are] suggesting potential production cuts should supply chain disruptions persist into Q2 or later, wrote Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief US economist The FTSE 100 index in London lost 247 points to 7,156.83, a 3.3% drop and its worst worst percentage fall since January 2016. Among the worst-hit stocks on the list of the UK's biggest public companies was the budget airline easyJet, which lost Β£1bn in value as the stock fell by more than 16%. The tour operator Tui fell by almost 10%, and the British Airways owner, IAG, dropped by 9%, on the back of expectations that the outbreak would lead to fewer people jetting away on holiday or for business. Shares in Carnival, the cruise ship operator that has faced an outbreak of the virus on its Diamond Princess vessel, shed 6.8%. Seema Shah, chief strategist at investment manager Principal Global Investors, said: The spread of the virus outside China would mean even more pressure on European supply chains and consumer demand and may result in a wave of profit warnings if the spread accelerates. The dramatic plunge in the financial markets comes as Italy emerged at the centre of the coronavirus crisis in Europe, reporting its sixth death on Monday. The number of cases in the country rose to more than 200, the highest number outside Asia. The eurozone's third largest economy is already shrinking and the rapid spread of the virus has sparked fears of a recession at a delicate moment. Italian authorities have responded by locking down 12 cities in the north of the country and the Venice carnival has been cut short by two days. The Italian stock market tumbled by almost 1,500 points to 23,288.35, a 6% slide, putting it on track for its worst day since 2016. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's Dax index fell 3.5% while France's Cac 40 lost 3.7%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.8%, while South Korea's Kospi slumped 3.9%. The number of coronavirus cases rose to 763. Japan's stock market was closed for a scheduled holiday. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: It has been a while since the term sea of red' was last deployed to describe the market action, but it seems appropriate this morning. The idea that the coronavirus has been fully contained has been firmly banished, and investors are now on notice to expect more cases and, sadly, more deaths. This means the economic forecasts of the impact, such as they are, will need to be revised, with a greater impact now to be expected. Stock markets had fallen sharply at the end of January as news of the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, prompting fears over the global economy because of slowing growth on the back of the US-China trade war. Steps by the People's Bank of China to inject billions into the world's second largest economy then led to a rally. However, fresh concerns over the rising impact from the virus have returned to dent optimism. Oil prices have fallen as global demand is likely to decline because of the virus outbreak and China is the world's biggest importer of oil. Brent crude tumbled by $2.66 a barrel to $55.69, a 4.6% fall. Warren Patterson, head of commodity strategy at ING, said: We believe the virus's effect on oil demand will shave some 400,000 barrels a day from global consumption growth, taking us to the lowest level in nearly a decade. As the virus spreads, the Beijing motor show in late April has been postponed. The owner of Primark, Associated British Foods, warned on Monday that there could be shortages of some clothing lines later this year if factory shutdowns in China are prolonged.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lorenzo-tondo,2/24/2020,theguardian,Salvini attacks Italy PM over coronavirus and links to rescue ship,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/salvini-attacks-italy-pm-over-coronavirus-and-links-to-rescue-ship,"Italy's far-right former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has attempted to politicise the coronavirus outbreak in the country, attacking the Italian government for not defending the country's borders. On Sunday, Salvini, who is also the leader of the League party, called on the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to resign if he isn't able to defend Italy and Italians. Salvini cited the docking of the NGO Ocean Viking rescue ship in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo with 276 African migrants onboard to say Italy needed to make our borders armour-plated. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as: Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 31 March, more than 780,000 people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 37,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 11,500 fatalities, and there have been over 7,700 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 164,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 166,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. The rescued asylum seekers were placed in isolation for two weeks to check for coronavirus, while the crew were confined to the ship. None of the cases in Italy, so far, have been linked to African migrants. During a press conference in Genoa, Salvini said: The government has underestimated the coronavirus. Allowing the migrants to land from Africa, where the presence of the virus was confirmed, is irresponsible. Africa has so far had only one confirmed case of Covid-19, in Egypt. On Saturday, the Italian authorities implemented draconian measures to try to halt the coronavirus outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. The number of cases of the virus in Italy has risen to 229 and six people have died. Police are patrolling 11 towns “ mostly in the Lombardy region, where the first locally transmitted case emerged “ that have been in lockdown since Friday night. It is not the first time Salvini has exploited the coronavirus crisis to criticise the government and migrants. In late January, he attacked Conte over the landing of other migrants in Italy when the virus had not yet broken out in the country. In Civitavecchia, 6,000 cruise passengers are stuck onboard for two suspected cases, while in Taranto the ports are wide open for 400 alleged refugees from who knows where. We must armour-plate our borders, Salvini said on 30 January. Referring to the League's political exploitation of the outbreak, Paola de Micheli, the minister of infrastructure, called Salvini a jackal. Politics should be united, De Micheli told journalists on Monday before the Democratic party's national assembly in Rome. Those like Salvini, who aspire to have a high-level institutional role, prove they are not up to the job.'' Meanwhile, Conte has made it known he contacted Salvini but that the leader of the League did not answer his call. Yesterday, I also wanted to inform the opposition forces of the measures we were taking, said Conte during an interview with Italian Tv La7. I spoke to Giorgia Meloni [leader of the Brothers of Italy party] and I was unable to reach Berlusconi, who called me back today. The only leader I have not managed to reach is Salvini. I called him yesterday and sent him a message. He did not reply. If he had the decency to answer, I would have explained to him why stricter measures could not have been implemented before.",general

I'm Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start the week. Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, has eased the lockdown that has been in place since 23 January by announcing that non-symptomatic people requiring medical operations will be allowed to leave the city. In another possible sign of improving conditions, Chinese media said that six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, while 24 out of 31 other Chinese provinces also recorded no rise. However, the situation appeared to be deteriorating in other parts of the world as South Korea reported another 161 cases overnight. Flights into the locked down city of Daegu have been suspended while Air New Zealand said it was putting its service to Seoul on hold. Stock markets, meanwhile, have taken a battering in the wake of Chinese president Xi Jinping's comments that the outbreak would have a big impact on the country's economy. Shares in Seoul plunged more than 3% and heavy losses are expected when trading gets under way in Europe and the US later. The jittery mood was not helped after experts warned earlier that the tipping point where the world would not be able to stop a pandemic was getting closer because of the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe. Turkey and Pakistan have closed borders with Iran, where eight people have died after contracting the virus. In Italy, authorities have imposed draconian measures to try to contain the spread of the virus in 11 towns in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto as the country notched up its third fatality. Patel denials “ An informed security source has denied reports that intelligence chiefs have lost confidence in the home secretary, Priti Patel. The source said Sunday Times reports at the weekend were simply untrue and that she was getting the same information from the agency as any other home secretary. It comes in the wake of a series of stories claiming that Patel has had difficult relationships with officials during her ministerial career. Her allies believe she is being targeted because officials do not like being challenged. Malaysia drama “ Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has resigned on a day of political drama. Mahathir, who is 94, took office in May 2018 when he defeated Najib Razak. Would-be leader Anwar Ibrahim earlier accused Mahathir of plotting to bring down the ruling coalition. Labour vote “ As Labour party members begin receiving ballot papers for the leadership election today, the frontrunner, Sir Keir Starmer, has pledged to give leading shadow cabinet posts to his rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Speaking at a hustings event in Durham, Starmer said they were both excellent candidates and suggested that all three represented the future of the party. Whichever one of us actually wins this, what you are seeing on display here is the leadership of the Labour party, he said. Most members will be able to vote via email, but paper ballots will be available as well. The vote closes on 2 April with the result to be announced two days later. Bin death warning “ At least seven people are known to have died in the last five years as a result of sleeping in bins and being crushed when the rubbish is emptied, the waste industry says, as it highlights a deadly consequence of Britain's growing homelessness problem. Bosses also say there were 109 near misses between April and December last year as destitute people increasingly seek shelter in large, enclosed rubbish containers. Diabetes risk “ A growing obesity crisis means a record number of people are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and with it an increased chance of a heart attack or stroke. To tackle the problem, the NHS is going to make a radical new liquid diet available to patients which will put type 2 diabetes into remission. A pilot scheme will see 5,000 patients restricted to 800 calories per day for three months. They will then have another nine months of support to help them maintain weight loss. Caught in a storm “ Hundreds of British holidaymakers stranded in the Canary Islands after a sandstorm may be able to return home today after airports reopened. The storm coated the islands in yellow dust and reduced visibility to zero on Sunday leaving tourists stuck. Flights from Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, North and South Tenerife airports were grounded but airports were beginning to reopen this morning. Manchester City's fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi. But after years of success, Europe's governing body has banned the club from its most prestigious tournament, the Champions League. David Conn explains why.

"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martinfarrer,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-kuo,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/helen-davidson",2/24/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: China postpones National People's Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-china-wuhan-lockdown-economy-south-korea-npc-annual-parliament,"China has delayed its annual parliamentary meeting as authorities struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread to more countries and prompted fears of a global pandemic. For the first time in decades, Beijing on Monday postponed the key political event, the National People's Congress (NPC), where hundreds of delegates gather in Beijing every March. The standing committee for the NPC said a new date for the meeting would be announced separately, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. China's national health commission reported its highest number of deaths in 11 days, with a further 150 victims. All but one of the fatalities and 11 of the new infections were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. The commission reported 409 new coronavirus cases, down from 648 a day earlier and, bringing the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China to 77,150. The provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Shanxi lowered their alert levels , following Gansu and Liaoning over the weekend. At a joint briefing in Beijing by the World Health Organization and China's national health commission, Bruce Aylward, the head of a team of WHO experts visiting China, said there had been a steep decline in the number of infections, despite statistical issues. Last week, China twice changed how it counts confirmed cases of infection, causing confusion. I know people look at the numbers and say what's really happening, he said, adding that multiple sources of data point to declines. This is falling and it is falling because of the actions that are being taken. Elsewhere, Iran's semi-official news agency reported that 50 people had died from the virus in the city of Qom this month, although a minister denied it. Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan reported their first cases as infections outside of China jumped. South Korea reported 70 more cases of the virus, bringing its total to 833. In Italy, authorities have implemented draconian measures to try to halt an outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas, as a fourth person was confirmed to have died there. Starting on Tuesday, Hong Kong will begin barring travellers from South Korea if they are not Hong Kong residents. The increase in the number of cases outside China comes a day after the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, gave a major speech on the crisis, seeking to assure the public that the virus would soon be contained. The reversal of a previous announcement that a lockdown would be loosened in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, has cast further doubt on the government's handling of the crisis. Authorities in Wuhan had said residents not under quarantine or observation could begin to leave the city, which has been subjected to strict traffic restrictions since 23 January. But later on Monday afternoon, a new statement declared the previous notice invalid and said all relevant personnel had been severely criticised and dealt with. The later notice called on Wuhan to firmly implement Xi's important instructions on preventing the export of the virus to other parts of the country. Beijing has begun to hit back against travel restrictions imposed on Chinese nationals. China's ministry of culture and tourism advised its citizens against travelling to the US, citing the country's overreaction to the virus, which had caused Chinese nationals to be treated unfairly. Wuhan's government said it would continue to impose strict controls over its borders in order to prevent the virus from spreading further. On Sunday, Xi said Covid-19 was both a crisis and a big test for the country, describing the virus as a major public health emergency and one of the country's biggest challenges since the founding of the people's republic. The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society, Xi said, but added that the impact would be temporary and generally manageable. Some observers greeted Monday's figures with scepticism, believing they are part of efforts to project a sense of control over the crisis. Chinese officials have twice changed the criteria for confirmed infections, making the data harder to parse. China reports only 11 new coronavirus cases outside of Hubei. Either Chinese officials:a) Have pioneered nearly universally-successful model to control virus (outside Hubei)b) Face major pressure to report low growth in virus case # given pressing need to restart economy. https://t.co/f2a6MVuVhX China has allocated 99.5bn yuan (Β£11bn) to curb the outbreak, China's assistant finance minister, Ou Wenhan, said in a Beijing press briefing on Monday. Officials from WHO visited Wuhan at the weekend for the first time since the outbreak, inspecting two hospitals and meeting officials at the centre for disease control in the province. There is growing alarm among economists and investors that the impact on global growth is going to be much worse than previously estimated. There is no official data about how the Chinese economy has fared in the past three weeks, but trackers of coal consumption and traffic congestion show that the world's second-biggest economy is still paralysed despite claims that many manufacturing areas are back to work. The presumption was that we would see intermediate supply chains quickly reconnected and I think the market has had to go through a period of questioning that logic, said Ray Attrill, the head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. The spike in the number of cases in South Korea on Monday, which brought the national total to 763, prompted shares to fall in Australia and Hong Kong. One of the nation's largest cities, Daegu, has been placed under semi-lockdown, its national assembly session has been cancelled, and the start of school postponed. Other nations have also begun to suspend flights into the country. South Korea's K-league postponed the start of the new football season in the face of the growing outbreak.",general

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-mcgowan,2/24/2020,theguardian,Q&A: Chinese diplomat grilled over Uighurs and coronavirus response,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/qa-chinese-diplomat-grilled-over-uighurs-and-coronavirus-response,"China's number two diplomat in Australia, Wang Xining, has defended shocking footage showing people suspected of having coronavirus being forcibly pushed into vans as justified, and described the detention camps used to hold an estimated one million people, mostly Uighurs, as training centres whose residents are mostly there voluntarily. In a rare public appearance on the ABC's Q&A on Monday night, Wang grimly held to party lines even as he was laughed at by audience members for his defence of the Chinese government's treatment of Uighurs and challenged by other panellists over the country's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The deputy ambassador also walked back his previous criticism of the Australian government's decision to impose travel bans on people coming from China as panic and overreaction, saying he commended the response of Australian medical authorities to the coronavirus outbreak. Wang's appearance on the revamped Q&A program was a coup for the ABC, but the diplomat did not get an easy run. He was repeatedly challenged by panellist Stan Grant, host Hamish MacDonald and another panellist, the journalist Vicky Xu, on his attempts to label China a democracy and on his defence of the country's response to the outbreak of the coronavirus. I don't think there is a cover-up, Wang said. It is a very sophisticated issue. It involved a lot of agencies and expertise. It takes time to make precise judgment on how to deal with. Xu challenged Wang's denials the country had attempted to cover up the outbreak of the coronavirus by pointing to the treatment of doctor Li Wenliang, who was punished for trying to raise the alarm about the spread of the virus before his death earlier this month. Wang called Li very respectable, saying people will remember him for what he [has] done. He's one of thousands of doctors and nurses who dedicated their life sometimes for the sake of this epidemic, he said. Wang also defended footage shown on the program of people believed to have the virus being manhandled on the street by authorities, saying it was justified if they were confirmed cases. If they're confirmed, they are the host, he said. Think of their neighbours. And think of now millions of people are staying home. If we let these people out “ and there are several cases recently of not communal outbreak, but people-to-people transmission “ those people who were infected, what do you say to that? China's response to the outbreak of the virus in the city of Wuhan early this year was also defended by global biosecurity expert Raina MacIntyre, who said the lockdown of the city was an accepted public health measure which had prevented cases from occurring in other countries and the rest of China. MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales, also pointed out Australia had laws allowing for the forcible isolation of people seen to be at risk of spreading an infectious disease. It has been used very infrequently but it has been used in Australia to essentially isolate people who are infectious with diseases such as TB or other [diseases], she said. Wang also sought to stick to the Chinese government's line over its treatment of the ethnic minority Muslim Uighur population, but was laughed at by audience members when he sought to correct MacDonald's description of the detention camps used to imprison the population by calling them training centres. Wang also claimed, incorrectly, that many people are held in the camps voluntarily, and said Australian defence minister Marise Payne had been misinformed when she described China's treatment of the Uighur as being disturbing. Madam Payne was misinformed, he said. Her views are sometimes [based] on the western media's portrayal about the issue. It's a training centre. People get to be prepared for future jobs.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-standaert,2/24/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus closures reveal vast scale of China's secretive wildlife farm industry,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-closures-reveal-vast-scale-of-chinas-secretive-wildlife-farm-industry,"Nearly 20,000 wildlife farms raising species including peacocks, civet cats, porcupines, ostriches, wild geese and boar have been shut down across China in the wake of the coronavirus, in a move that has exposed the hitherto unknown size of the industry. Until a few weeks ago wildlife farming was still being promoted by government agencies as an easy way for rural Chinese people to get rich. But the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to 2,666 deaths and over 77,700 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade. China issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February. The country's top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country's wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine. The current version of the law is seen as problematic by wildlife conservation groups because it focuses on utilisation of wildlife rather than its protection. The coronavirus epidemic is swiftly pushing China to reevaluate its relationship with wildlife, Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the Guardian. There is a high level of risk from this scale of breeding operations both to human health and to the impacts on populations of these animals in the wild. The National People's Congress released new measures on Monday restricting wildlife trade, banning consumption of bushmeat and sales of wildlife for meat consumption at wet markets between now and the time the Wildlife Protection Law can be amended and adopted. Untouched however, are breeding operations for traditional Chinese medicine, fur and leather, lucrative markets known to drive illegal poaching of animals including tigers and pangolins. For the past few years China's leadership has pushed the idea that wildlife domestication should be a key part of rural development, eco-tourism and poverty alleviation. A 2017 report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering on the development of the wildlife farming industry valued the wildlife-farming industry those operations at 520bn yuan, or Β£57bn. Just weeks before the outbreak, China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration (SFGA) was still actively encouraging citizens to get into farming wildlife such as civet cats “ a species pinpointed as a carrier of Sars, a disease similar to Covid-19. The SFGA regulates both farming and trade in terrestrial wildlife, and quotas of wildlife products “ such as pangolin scales “ allowed to be used by the Chinese medicine industry. Why are civet cats still encouraged to [be eaten] after the Sars outbreak in 2003? It's because the hunters, operators, practitioners need that. How can they achieve that? They urged the government to support them under the pretext of economic development, Jinfeng Zhou, secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF), told the Guardian. On state TV the popular series Secrets of Getting Rich, which has aired since 2001, often touts these kinds of breeding operations “ bamboo rats, snakes, toads, porcupines and squirrels have all had starring roles. But little was known about the scale of the wildlife farm industry before the coronavirus outbreak, with licensing mainly regulated by provincial and local-level forestry bureaus that do not divulge full information about the breeding operations under their watch. A report from state-run Xinhua news agency on 17 February revealed that from 2005“2013 the forestry administration only issued 3,725 breeding and operation licenses at the national level. But since the outbreak at least 19,000 farms have been shut down around the country, including about 4,600 in Jilin province, a major centre for traditional Chinese medicine. About 3,900 wildlife-farming operations were shuttered in Hunan province, 2,900 in Sichuan, 2,300 in Yunnan, 2,000 in Liaoning, and 1,000 in Shaanxi. There is little detail available about the animals farmed across China, but local press reports mention civet cats, bamboo rats, ostriches, wild boar, sika deer, foxes, ostriches, blue peacocks, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, wild geese, mallard ducks, red-billed geese, pigeons, and ring-necked pheasants. Neither do reports offer much detail about the shutdowns and what is happening to the animals, although Blake said he does not think animals are being culled, due to issues over compensation. Chen Hong, a peacock farmer in Liuyang, Hunan, said she is concerned about her losses and whether she will get compensation after her operations were suspended on 24 January. We now aren't allowed to sell the animals, transport them, or let anyone near them, and we have to sanitise the facility once every day, Chen said. Usually this time of year would see our farm bustling with clients and visitors. We haven't received notice on what to do yet, and the peacocks are still here, and we probably won't know what to do with [them] until after the outbreak is contained. We're very worried about the farm's future, she added. The shutdown has resulted in a loss of 400,000“500,000 yuan (Β£44,000“55,000) in sales, and if they decide to put an outright ban on raising peacocks, we'll lose even more, at least a million yuan(Β£110,000). On a visit to Shaoguan, Guangdong province, last year, the Guardian and staff from CBCGDF saw a caged facility previously used for attempted breeding of the notoriously hard-to-breed pangolin. While there were no longer pangolin at the site, several locals near the facility confirmed the species had been raised there, along with monkeys and other wildlife. Besides being used for Chinese medicine, much of the meat from the wildlife trade is sold through online platforms or to wet markets like the one where the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have started in Wuhan. All animals or their body parts for human consumption are supposed to go through food and health checks, but I don't think the sellers ever bothered, said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China. Most of them [have been] sold without such health checks. There have been calls for a deep regulatory overhaul to remove the conflicting duties of the forestry administration, and for a shift in government mindset away from promoting the utilisation of wildlife and towards its protection. The referee-player' combination needs to be addressed and is the toughest [challenge], Li Shuo, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia told the Guardian. This goes back to the institutional identity [of the SFGA] which was established to oversee timber production. Protection was an afterthought. Proposals include fully banning trade in wildlife that is protected or endangered within and outside of China, plus bans on raising and selling meat from known carriers of diseases that can impact humans such as civets, bats and rodents. There are concerns that in trying to prevent outbreaks authorities may go too far in the culling of wild animals that can carry disease. Some law professors have suggested ecological killing' of disease-transmitting wild animals, such as pangolins, hedgehogs, bats, snakes, and some insects, Zhou said. We believe lawmakers need to learn [more about] biodiversity before advising on the revisions to the law, or they'll bring disaster. Additional research and reporting assistance provided by Jonathan Zhong.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nilspratley,2/24/2020,theguardian,EasyJet's tumble marks the moment when investors collided with reality,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/24/easyjets-tumble-marks-the-moment-when-investors-collided-with-reality,"There goes Β£1bn from easyJet's stock market value. At the close of trading last Friday, the airline was valued at roughly Β£6bn. After Monday's 16.7% fall amid investors' alarm about coronavirus “ and, in particular, Italy's extreme measures to contain the spread “ easyJet is now worth Β£5bn. EasyJet's tumble is just an illustration of how, until Monday, investors had been extraordinarily unconcerned about the potential economic impact of coronavirus. At the start of this month, City analysts were proclaiming confidently that, since world stock markets recovered quickly from the Sars crisis of 2002-03, there was little need to adjust portfolios. The disruption, the theory ran, would be temporary and economic activity would merely be deferred. That thesis felt woefully superficial for several reasons. First, stock market pundits tend to have no expertise in epidemiology. Second, unlike in 2003, stock market valuations are already high by traditional yardsticks. Third, China, where the effect on economic activity will clearly be severe in the first quarter of this year, now accounts for almost a fifth of global GDP, versus about 6% at the time of Sars. Monday's market wobble, then, marks the moment when investors collided with reality and had to start to price specific risks. While it is possible to believe that Apple, for example, will recover from the iPhone supply shortages in its Chinese factories that it warned about last week, a drop-off in travel within Europe would clearly hurt almost every tourism-related venture. Journeys wouldn't be deferred; some just wouldn't happen. And the effect on profits could be exaggerated since ticket prices tend to be set by the level of marginal demand. We have yet to see hard evidence of that impact, but the City is now braced for profit warnings from European travel firms unless the news on containment improves rapidly. The unknowns are piling up; what matters is not simply the rate of infection, it's also the behaviour of fearful consumers, which is even harder to predict. Stock markets were too complacent. Reinvigorating Countrywide, the debt-laden estate agency group that owns Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, would take three years, declared executive chairman Peter Long in 2018. After completing half the allotted span, Long seems to have decided the task is near impossible, at least in standalone form. That's the message implied by the decision to enter merger talks with LSL Property Services. Countrywide, which in its heyday used to be described as the UK's biggest estate agent, will be the junior partner if the Β£460m-ish tie-up proceeds. The move will feel desperate to those investors who backed a Β£140m rescue refinancing in August 2018. They paid the equivalent (after a share consolidation) of 500p a pop, but the share price is still a miserable 340p. Maybe Long can discover some deal-making magic during the talks, but his negotiating hand looks weak. Countrywide was carrying Β£90m of debt at last count, or more than three times top-line earnings “ too much for an estate agency. One can blame a sluggish property market or the rise of online-only rivals, but the basic problem is simple: there are too many estate agents in the UK and most are obliged to pass vast chunks of their marketing budgets to Rightmove and its imitators. A Countrywide/LSL merger would allow hefty cost-cutting within a combined entity with 14,000 employees and 1,000 branches, but the Rightmove obstacle looks large and immovable. The FTSE 100 website is worth Β£6bn these days and has transformed the house-hunting game. If Countrywide et al wanted to mount a serious fightback, their best opportunity was a decade ago. Prudential, having spun off UK-based fund manager M&G last year, probably suspected this moment would arrive, and now it has: Third Point, an aggressive US hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, wants a full break-up, meaning a split between the fast-growing PruAsia business and the plodding Jackson National Life operation in the US. Loeb's crew has bought a 5%, or $2bn stake, to lobby its case. Pru will need to provide a full answer, but one defence of the current set-up is obvious: if nobody wants to buy Jackson for a fat price, which is probably the case, there isn't much hidden value to be released. Still, it will be fun to hear Pru's top brass explain why they still deserve to earn their big bucks in pleasant surroundings in London to run operations on two different continents.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-partington,2/24/2020,theguardian,New chancellor will not want to be 'creature of No 10' “ David Gauke,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/24/new-chancellor-will-not-want-to-be-creature-of-no-10-david-gauke-rishi-sunak,"A former Conservative cabinet minister has said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will want to avoid becoming a creature of No 10 amid pressure on the new appointee to raise government borrowing sharply. David Gauke, the former justice secretary who was expelled from the Conservatives for defying Boris Johnson over Brexit, said that Sunak risked putting the public finances on an unsustainable path, given the headwinds facing the British economy. Acknowledging that spending needed to rise to end a decade of austerity that he helped to instigate as a Treasury minister between 2010 to 2017, Gauke said: You have got a new chancellor who will want to establish that he is not a creature of No 10; who is independent. However, he said that Sunak might raise borrowing at the budget on 11 March. He, I would imagine, would want to assert that independence. If not necessarily on 11 March, sooner rather than later. Gauke's comments at an event hosted by the Resolution Foundation thinktank in London come as Sunak prepares to reveal what is widely expected to be one of the most expansionary Tory budgets in a generation. The 39-year-old replaced Sajid Javid when the former chancellor dramatically resigned earlier this month after a confrontation with No 10. Javid had been labelled in Westminster circles as chino “ chancellor in name only “ while commentators warned that Sunak could become known as baby chino, given his rapid rise to become one of the youngest chancellors in history. Sunak is believed to be under pressure from No 10 to relax public borrowing rules set by Javid before the election that force day-to-day spending to be matched with tax receipts by 2023. Investment spending on long-term infrastructure projects must not exceed 3% of GDP. Gauke, who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire, said the government's plans to raise spending could result in the UK's national debt rising as a proportion of GDP. Saying this was a very strange position to find ourselves in, particularly for a Tory government, he added that there were fundamental constraints for the government and risks that debt could be rising as the economy falters. He warned that Brexit or the coronavirus outbreak could damage growth and the public purse. He said: If we had a downturn in the economy, are we saying that debt to GDP grows slowly and then grows very quickly, before reverting to growing slowly again? That strikes me as an unsustainable position. The former Treasury minister, who was second-in-command under Philip Hammond and served under George Osborne, said the department with overarching control over tax and spending decisions needed to be pretty tight with public spending, and making sure we do prioritise. He said the alternative would be tax increases, which the Tory party was unwilling to contemplate. In recognition of the bind facing the chancellor, Gauke said the ministry of justice had faced an essentially unsustainable funding settlement during his time in charge of the department. Warning that the government's planned tough approach to prison sentencing would mean higher prisoner numbers in future “ requiring more prison officers and greater funding “ he said: Those pressures are going to increase yet further.",general
"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samjones,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/aamna-mohdin",2/24/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: Iran denies cover-up as six deaths reported in Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-dead-in-iranian-city-of-qom,"The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of an outbreak of the coronavirus, as Italy reported six deaths and officials across the Middle East and Europe scrambled to limit its spread. On Monday, a lawmaker from Qom “ a Shia holy city 75 miles (120 km) south of the capital, Tehran, accused Iran's health minister of lying about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case “ about as serious as a regular cold “ and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 4 April, more than 1.1m people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 58,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 14,600 fatalities, and there have been over 11,000 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 278,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 226,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. The rest of the media have not published this figure, but we prefer not to censor what concerns the coronavirus because people's lives are in danger, the Ilna editor Fatemeh Madiani told Agence France-Presse. But the country's deputy health minister rejected the report. In a news conference broadcast live on state television, Iraj Harirchi said 12 people had died from the coronavirus and 66 had been infected. I categorically deny this information, he said, adding: This is not the time for political confrontations. The coronavirus is a national problem. Elsewhere in the Middle East on Monday, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq reported their first cases “ all involving people who had come from Iran. In Italy, which has become the focal point of the outbreak in Europe, officials said 219 people had tested positive and the death toll was raised to six. Iran's government pledged to be transparent about the outbreak. We will announce any figures [we have] on the number of deaths throughout the country. We pledge to be transparent about the reporting of figures, the spokesman Ali Rabiei said. Iran has been scrambling to contain the Covid-19 outbreak since it announced the first two deaths in Qom on Wednesday last week. Since then, it has said 12 people have died from the virus among 61 infections. Authorities have closed schools across much of the country for a second day, as neighbouring countries reported infections from travellers from Iran, prompting several to shut their borders to Iranian citizens. The number of deaths compared with the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country, including China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread. Iranian health officials have not said whether health workers in Qom who first came in contact with infected people had taken precautionary measures in treating those who died of the virus. Iran also has not said how many people are in quarantine across the country overall. On Sunday, experts warned that the disease was outpacing attempts to contain it. The tipping point after which our ability to prevent a global pandemic ends seems a lot closer after the past 24 hours, said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and an authority on the new coronavirus. Hunter said the situation in Iran would have major implications for the Middle East. It is unlikely that Iran will have the resources and facilities to adequately identify cases and adequately manage them if case numbers are large, he said. A further problem with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region. During armed conflicts borders between countries become porous and urban and healthcare facilities are often targeted and destroyed. As we have seen with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and poliomyelitis in Syria, war facilitates the spread of infectious disease and hampers public health responses. Italian authorities are also rushing to contain the continent's first major outbreak of the disease after a sixth death in the country. Italy has so far recorded 219 confirmed cases, the most of any European country. The Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. About 50,000 people in 11 north Italian towns have been under lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines being imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. France's junior transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said on Monday that there was no need to close down transport borders between France and Italy. Closing down the borders would make no sense, as the circulation of the virus is not just limited to administrative borders, he told BFM Business. The government urged anyone who had visited Lombardy or Veneto to wear face masks if they go outside, limit non-essential activities and take their temperatures twice a day. A spokesman for Germany's interior ministry said the country would not be closing its borders. A health ministry spokesman said the danger to the German population from coronavirus remained low but added that the assessment could change at short notice. Austria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice in Italy to Munich in Germany was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley,2/24/2020,theguardian,"Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic 'in all but name', says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-in-all-but-name-says-expert,"The World Health Organization has played down fears of a coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world, despite sudden serious outbreaks in Italy and Iran, but some experts said they believed it was now inevitable. Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear, said the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at a briefing. We are not there yet, said Tedros. What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways. The word pandemic is used to describe a serious disease that is spreading in an uncontrolled way around the world. China, he pointed out, appeared to have contained it. The international team sent in by the WHO, which is about to report its findings, has said the virus probably peaked between 23 January and 2 February. Tedros added, however, that the sudden increase in new cases is certainly very concerning. Most worrying is the arrival of the coronavirus in Italy and Iran with no prior warning, presumably spread by people who were asymptomatic carriers. Italy now has 219 cases and seven people have died. The figures in Iran are disputed, but some reports claimed there had been 50 deaths in the city of Qom, which is a pilgrimage site. Other experts said it was hard to believe that Covid-19 would not now spread worldwide. We now consider this to be a pandemic in all but name, and it's only a matter of time before the World Health Organization starts to use the term in its communications, said Dr Bharat Pankhania, from the University of Exeter Medical School. This gives us focus and tells us that the virus is now appearing in other countries and transmitting far afield from China. However, it doesn't change our approach in monitoring the outbreak. In the UK, there's no need to move towards mitigation strategies, as so far, our containment policies are working. We only have 13 cases, and they are contained and controlled. I expect we will continue with this containment strategy while it's successful. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. A pandemic means an infectious disease is spreading out of control in different regions of the world. We already have a Covid-19 epidemic in China and, more recently, large outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. If those outbreaks cannot be brought under control, then Covid-19 would fit the criteria of a pandemic, said Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. The immediate implication is that many different countries around the world may be sources of Covid-19 infections. This makes it much harder for any one country to detect and contain imported cases and trying to do so will place ever greater demands on national health systems. Tedros said the new cases outside China reinforced the need for all countries to ensure they were ready for the arrival of Covid-19. This is the time for all countries, communities and families and individuals to focus on preparing, he said. We do not live in a binary black and white world. It is not either/or. We must focus on containing while doing all we can to prepare for a potential pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded on the 7 April 1948, a date celebrated annually as World Health Day. As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIV/AIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis. WHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus. The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia's minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country's health system. Grace Mainwaring That would mean safeguarding the elderly and those with health problems and weakened immune systems, who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus. Dr Michael Ryan, WHO's director of emergencies, said a flu pandemic was more recognisable because of the knowledge scientists have of the way influenza viruses behave. What we don't understand yet in Covid-19 is the absolute transmission dynamics, he said. The Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarah-martin,2/24/2020,theguardian,Morrison steps away from surplus pledge amid 'unknown global shock' of coronavirus,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/morrison-steps-away-from-surplus-pledge-amid-unknown-global-shock-of-coronavirus,"Scott Morrison has declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus an unknown global shock as he stepped away from the government's pledge to deliver a surplus for the first time in more than a decade. While dismissing questions about the likelihood of achieving a surplus as speculation, the prime minister refused to recommit to bringing the budget back into the black in the May budget, as was forecast in December's mid-year budget update. We will deal with that at the time of the budget, Morrison said. Now when we framed the budget a year ago, hands up those who thought there was going to be a coronavirus epidemic when the budget was released last May? Of course no one did. These are unknown global shocks. So we're dealing with those shocks and we're processing that through how we look at the budget as we go into May and beyond. Morrison said the government would attempt to alleviate some of the economic shocks of the global health crisis, which had reverberated through the tourism, education and trade sectors, with a focus on the domestic economy. However, he warned that the impact on global trade was having a ripple effect on the domestic building and manufacturing industry, amid warnings that supplies from closed Chinese factories may soon run out. The world economy has become increasingly interconnected and interdependent over many, many years. And what this impact is is putting up walls and blockages between those connections, between all of these countries. Even without a travel ban, there would have been a significant reduction in the movement of people, as we're seeing all around the world. That also means the movements of goods and services. Morrison warned that the government had limited options to prop up the economy through domestic activity. The Australian economy will depend a lot more on its domestic elements and it won't have the same impact from the external components because of the disruption of supply chains and trade impacts and the movement of people, Morrison said. That's to be expected. But for how long that occurs ¦ that is not clear. Morrison said business-as-usual could be maintained domestically, but Australia's economy was now connected globally, with Chinese trade accounting for about 7% of the economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who has just returned from a meeting of global finance ministers in Saudi Arabia, said global growth had been downgraded, but the knock-on effect to the domestic economy was not yet clear. Treasury have told me they haven't finalised their advice on the economic impact of the virus, Frydenberg said. He said preliminary work by the International Monetary Fund had indicated that global growth would be downgraded from 3.3% to 3.2% for 2020. The government has already twice extended a travel ban for Chinese foreign nationals coming to Australia, which is being reviewed on a weekly basis. But Morrison said the government was not considering extending the ban to other countries where the virus was now affecting significant numbers of people. . We have no advice from the medical experts to suggest that that should be done at this point, he said.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sirin-kale,2/24/2020,theguardian,How Britain became a nation of stockpilers: 'It just feels like something is going to give',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/zombie-apocalypse-coronavirus-stockpilers-emergency-food,"James Blake, the owner of Europe's largest emergency food supplier, is one of the few people to be doing good business out of coronavirus. Are you planning to hole up indoors while a pandemic, natural disaster or terrorist attack runs its course? Blake's company “ Emergency Food Storage UK “ has got you covered, but it's not cheap: Β£385 will buy you one month of food, as long as you like freeze-dried macaroni cheese and chicken-fried rice. The prices aren't putting Blake's customers off. Since coronavirus emerged in China in December, he has been swamped with orders. In the last two weeks alone, Emergency Food has done as much business as it normally would in six months. Which is bad news for anyone thinking now might be a good time to stock up on some of its powdered custard apple crunch, because it's all gone. This is all we have left, says Blake, gesturing around his half-empty warehouse. (He has insisted I keep the location secret, for security reasons. He has also refused to tell me his age, for reasons that are unclear.) The shelves are mostly bare, save for some tins of spaghetti bolognese, chilli and three-bean stew. In the corner are water filtration devices: a jerrycan with built-in antibacterial filter, and smaller, more portable bottles. We are actually in the smaller warehouse Blake uses to house his personal supplies, and orders that have yet to be filled. There was no point in showing me his main warehouse, because it's empty. These are busy times for his company, which has also had to contend with public fears about Brexit affecting the food supply. The Β£375 Brexit Box “ featuring 60 main meals, a water filter and firestarter “ flew off the shelves last year. Blake sources his food from a factory in Lancashire, which is working 24/7 to replenish his stock. In addition to shipping Brexit Boxes direct to consumers, Blake says that Emergency Food also supplies government departments, although he won't reveal which. And you'll find his freeze-dried emergency food on the RRS Sir David Attenborough, commonly known as Boaty McBoatface. We're not looking at a zombie apocalypse situation, Blake admits. Most short-term issues can be resolved in time. Still, We should all just be a little more self-reliant. Self-reliance is the organising principle of Blake's life: he grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, and food preparation is an integral part of Mormon life. As a child, Blake would watch his mother store and preserve food. Wheat was a big thing, he says. We would always have a few containers. Although he left the Mormons in his 20s, some habits are hard to shake: opening a ceiling hatch, Blake reveals a secret stash of foil-lined bags of wheat. He argues that the people buying from him are the opposite of selfish. You're protecting the food in the supermarket, by purchasing your supplies from a different point. He doesn't like the word stockpiling “ but prepping won't work either. Prepping has a negative connotation perpetuated by the media, he says, because they see preppers as often quite crazy. He favours the term food storage, which he sees as more neutral. If you think about what's in your kitchen cupboard today, he says, it's a few tins of beans, some manky rice. You might be able to cobble together food for a few days. Imagine a disaster lasting weeks before infrastructure is back up. It's not just Blake's tills that are ringing. Purveyors of antibacterial hand gel, dust masks and even facial respirators are doing brisk business. Inevitably, prices have rocketed as a result of coronavirus fears. I'm panicked like crazy because I want to protect the people I love, says Andrew (not his real name), a 30-year-old property developer from Essex. But I don't know if I want to spend Β£50 on a full face mask. Perhaps he should have a word with 49-year-old Kerry Collinson, from Somerset, who already has a large box of face masks, which she purchased earlier this month. What Andrew has stockpiled is Β£100 worth of food and water. And he is planning to buy more. I know it sounds crazy, he says, but I'd sooner spend the money now and have it and not need it. And he is planning to buy more. We are not at the point of panic, says Prof Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University. Public Health England agrees. But who listens to experts?. Stockpiling is an understandable psychological response in times of stress. If you are told your neighbours are stockpiling, and you perceive that the goods in question are of a finite nature, then it's not irrational to stockpile, says Prof John Drury, an expert in crowd psychology and disasters at the University of Sussex. For you as an individual, it makes sense to do the same. We have been here before. After 9/11, Claudia (not her real name), a 60-year-old homemaker from London, slept with a radio beside her bed. She had read articles about al-Qaida planning a chemical attack on London, and wanted to be ready to take it down to her cellar, which she had stocked with tinned food and bottled water. I wanted to make sure that if there was an attack, we'd be OK, she says. Of course, the attack never happened. The food gradually came out, Claudia says. The water stayed there for a long time, and then we used it to water the garden. When Paddy Tipping was the government minister responsible for getting the UK ready for the year 2000, he had to contend with a general public anxious about the so-called millennium bug. Aeroplanes were going to drop out of the sky, is one of the doomsday scenarios Tipping remembers. The food chain would dry up and collapse. Power stations would short and not be able to provide electricity. Some people stockpiled, worried about what would happen. Daytime TV stalwarts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan were rapped on the knuckles by the government for an episode of This Morning that was accused of encouraging viewers to stockpile 10 weeks' worth of food. But for the most part, the press played ball, and Tipping was able to prevent the spread of misinformation. But that was before social media. Tipping questions whether his job would be possible nowadays. We're not as effective at getting the message out and taking false stuff on. Collinson started stockpiling after seeing videos purporting to be from inside China on social media. I kept seeing videos of dead bodies and people falling over in the street, she says. I think realistically 50% of them are absolute rubbish, she adds. And yet she's still putting emergency supplies aside. I'm an army brat. I've always been brought up with that mindset of being prepared. It just seems common sense to have things on hand, just in case. So what should the rest of us be doing? There's no need to hoard, Katz stresses. Instead, have a basic preparedness plan. That means having a month's supply of any essential medicines, and a few days' worth of food. It's best to buy tinned foods that you would normally eat, rather than expensive freeze-dried meals that will only ever seem like an attractive proposition in a nuclear winter. I sampled Emergency Food's vegetable chipotle chilli, and the texture can best be described as mulchy. All this talk of preparedness sounds extreme. And yet it is true that the UK's food situation is more insecure than many people realise. The food sector today runs on a just-in-time' logistics system, says Prof Tim Lang, an expert in food policy at City, University of London. The whole idea is to not have storage. In addition to this vulnerable supply chain, domestic food production has steadily dropped in the last three decades. Between 40-50% of our food is produced abroad. Were disaster to affect food-producing regions of Spain and north Africa, for example, our food supply would be hit. Britain is catastrophically dependent on external sources, Lang says. It's not just food supplies that are vulnerable. Last week the British press reported that the likes of Halfords, Primark and Asos were bracing themselves for stock shortages as the coronavirus outbreak closed Chinese factories. Earlier generations routinely laid down food supplies in times of plenty, to stave off future want. During the second world war, the British government advised citizens to develop their own food stores “ around a week's supply was deemed adequate. Leaflets were issued with advice on which tinned foods to buy, and how best to store essentials such as flour, sugar and cereals. Our grandmothers strained boiled fruit through muslin; they pickled vegetables and salted fish. But modern life has made us complacent. We've been in a wonderful time of plenty, says Blake. We can just nip in the car, pop to the supermarket, and buy whatever we want. It's a fantastic way to live. It's wonderful. He pauses. As long as something doesn't go wrong. How did we become so relaxed about where our next-but-one meal might come from? In the UK, Blake lays some of the blame on the 90s and New Labour, which he says bred a culture of hope back into a society that had become hopeless. There was this feeling of ahhh “ things will be different. It was a comforting lie. The reality is that government is government, and there is only so much you can do. If the 90s were one long exhale of contentment, with the end of the cold war and the apparent triumph of liberal democracy, the 2000s and 2010s were a collective intake of breath. Successive terrorist attacks and a global recession undermined our faith in a safer, more prosperous future. All of this was brilliant news for Emergency Food Storage UK. After all, when your business model depends on people's darkest fears, there's nothing like a bit of global tumult to get the orders coming in. Blake founded the company in 2009 “ when Twitter was in its infancy “ and its growth has mirrored the rise of social media, and our concomitant loss of faith in government and the media to keep us safe and tell us the truth. Given everything that has happened in recent years, the desire to stockpile food is understandable. When you feel like events are slipping into the abyss, stockpiling is a way to regain a sense of control. It's like, all of a sudden, bushfires, coronavirus, world war three with Iran, says Andrew. It's the worst few months I can remember as an adult ¦ It just feels like enough is enough, and something is going to give. Stockpiling may not be the answer. And freeze-dried food doesn't taste great. But if you can afford it and have the space, a few extra tins in your cupboard is never a bad idea.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tom-kludt,2/24/2020,theguardian,"'The losses are substantial': the NBA's trouble with China, four months on",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/24/china-nba-hong-kong-protests-financial-costs-update,"For someone who was raised in Italy, came of age in Philadelphia, and ultimately established himself as a star in southern California, it is telling that Kobe Bryant once referred to China as his home away from home. Bryant first visited the country in 1998 to host a basketball camp, a year after he entered the NBA straight out of high school. The trips would become a fixture of Bryant's offseason during his 20-year career. There he was, wowing fans with slam dunks on the Great Wall. And there he was, getting mobbed at airports in scenes reminiscent of Beatlemania. I thought I was famous, remarked LeBron James at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, until I got here with Kobe. Bryant had the best-selling sports jersey in China for years, and by the time he retired in 2016, he was far and away the country's most popular athlete. A reported 110 million people tuned in to Tencent, the NBA's digital streaming partner in China, to watch Bryant's last game for the Lakers. It's harder for me to walk around here than in the States, Bryant said during a 2013 visit. In the States, you get a lot of recognition. They say, Hi.' They want autographs and pictures. But here, it's uncontrollable. They rush you and surround you to the point where you can't go out. Bryant's shocking death last month prompted a similar mass outpouring on Weibo, essentially China's version of Twitter, where he had posted a video message commemorating Chinese New Year to his nine million followers just two days before his helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California. Bryant's status in China serves as a powerful symbol of the NBA's successful global outreach; his rise in popularity dovetailed with basketball's own precipitous growth in the country. But the league that Bryant helped popularize there remains off the air on Chinese state television, the fallout from a months-long standoff over a top NBA executive's expression of solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As the NBA commences the second half of its season, and continues to mourn the untimely loss of a legend, there is a sense of hope that the league is close to repairing its relationship with China “ even if there are questions over whether it will ever be the same. There have indeed been signals in recent weeks of a potential thawing of tensions between the two sides. Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, offered a tribute to Bryant on Twitter last month, praising the Lakers great for his contribution to the world of sport and to #ChinaUS people-to-people exchanges. Chinese consul general Huang Ping offered gratitude earlier this month for the NBA's $1.4m donation to Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak originated. At a press conference held during the league's all-star festivities in Chicago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said his sense is that the games will return to China Central Television (CCTV), Chinese state-run television, at some point in the future. The NBA has not been broadcast on CCTV since October, when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey caused a furor by tweeting, and quickly deleting, a message urging his followers to stand with Hong Kong. At the league's midseason celebration in Chicago, Silver made it clear that the ball is in China's court. Silver added that there continues to be enormous interest for the NBA in China, and that his sense is that there will be a return to normalcy fairly soon. The All-Star events in Chicago were distributed on Tencent, with which the NBA inked a five-year, $1.5bn deal last summer to continue as the league's exclusive Chinese digital streaming partner. Despite the ongoing blackout on CCTV, Tencent resumed showing a few NBA games every night not long after the Morey dispute, and has continued to do so since. A recent survey of sports business executives found that more than 60% believe that the firestorm surrounding Morey's tweet will have a non-existent or minor effect on the league's business in China five years from now. Others aren't so sure. The question is: what does normalcy mean? Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown University who served as director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council from 2004-2007, told the Guardian. When Adam Silver talks about a return to normalcy, I assume he's talking about NBA access to Chinese viewers and the Chinese market, but the real question is: is that the only way to measure normal? Is the new normal that there's essentially a de facto muzzle on players saying anything related to political issues in China? If tanks roll through Hong Kong, Cha added, are they just not going to say anything? Although Silver rebuffed China's purported demands to sack Morey, and defended his right to freedom of expression, the NBA and its players were not exactly hailed as profiles in courage in the wake of the controversy. A spokesperson for the NBA responded initially by saying that the league recognized the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. LeBron James, who has personified the league's embrace of political activism perhaps more than any other player, said Morey was misinformed on the matter. Lawmakers in Washington chastised the league for that response. Republican senator Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, commended Morey for calling out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong, and pilloried the NBA for shamefully retreating out of financial concerns. The fiscal implications have loomed large over this saga. Speaking in Chicago this month, Silver said he expected the NBA to lose hundreds of millions of dollars over the standoff with China due to the TV blackout and the severed business relationships that resulted from the dispute. That, he noted, was much less than some of the doomsday forecasts that projected the controversy to cost the league billions. Certainly, probably less than $400m, maybe even less than that, he said. It's substantial. I don't want to run from that. We were taken off the air in China for a period of time, and it caused our many business partners in China to feel it was, therefore, inappropriate to have ongoing relationships with us. But Silver once again stressed that he doesn't have any sense that there's any permanent damage to our business there. It's a business relationship rooted in the NBA's emergence as China's most popular sports league, the fruits of the league's decades-long push into the Asian market. In 1992 under the late David Stern, Silver's predecessor as commissioner, the NBA opened its first Asian office in Hong Kong. Stern, who served as commissioner from 1984 until 2014, is widely credited for exporting the league to China. In 1987, Stern went to Beijing with a demo tape in hand in the hopes of brokering a historic deal. There, he forged a relationship between the NBA and CCTV, offering the state broadcaster videotapes of league footage each week in exchange for advertising revenue. Stern often recalled trips to the country in the 1990s, when locals would ask about the team of the red oxen, better known in the English speaking world as the Chicago Bulls. But the watershed moment came in 2002, when Yao Ming was drafted by the Rockets. In Yao, China could finally claim its own first bona fide star playing in its most beloved sporting league. Powered by ballots cast back home, Yao was twice the leader of NBA All-Star game fan voting. He was named an All-Star in each of his eight seasons for the Rockets, a career that coincided with the NBA staging more events in China. In 2004, the Rockets played a pair of preseason games in Shanghai and Beijing, marking the first time the NBA tipped off on Chinese soil in 25 years. Since 2007, the NBA has held preseason games in China every year except one. About 800 million viewers in China watched the NBA last season, and modest estimates of the amount of revenue the league generates there are generally pegged at about $500m annually. NBA China, which launched in 2008 and handles the league's business ventures in the country, is worth more than $4bn, according to Forbes. The Rockets also loom large over all of this, of course. They are, by virtue of Yao's connection, the NBA's most popular team in China, bringing the league's success story in conflict with the crisis over Morey's tweet. Since then, Rockets games have been banned, forcing the team's fans in China to resort to illicit web streams. Cha wonders if the team will return to CCTV or Tencent even when the rest of the league is back on Chinese airwaves. He pointed to the frayed relationship between China and Norway, which stemmed from the late human rights activist Liu Xiaobo winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, as a potentially useful precedent. Liu was incarcerated in a Chinese prison at the time, and the price was placed on an empty chair during the ceremony in Oslo. In the years that followed, Norway's salmon exports to China plunged. I'd imagine the longer this goes on, the more unhappy the people are going to be. Basketball is extremely popular in China. The Rockets are a very popular team, Cha said. You can substitute Norwegian salmon. There is really no substitute for the NBA.",general

Huileng Tan@huileng_tan,2/24/2020,cnbc,China's Xi Jinping speaks about coronavirus threat on economy,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/chinas-xi-jinping-speaks-about-coronavirus-threat-on-economy.html,"The Chinese leadership is rallying its people to get back to work even as the country continues to battle with the coronavirus outbreak, amid city-wide lockdowns and quarantines in the worst-hit regions. ""This is both a crisis and a big test for us,"" President Xi Jinping said at a Sunday meeting in Beijing, state news agency Xinhua reported. He said efforts were being made to cure people, reduce fatality rates, safeguard social stability, and strengthen China's emergency medical supplies and daily necessities, according to Xinhua's translations of his remarks. Since end-January, the world's second largest economy has shut down factories, businesses and schools in efforts to limit the spread of the disease, which has killed nearly 2,600 and infected more than 77,000 in the mainland so far. The prolonged Lunar New Year holiday has had knock-on effects on the global supply chain and dented overall market sentiment. It has also spurred global companies to further diversify their supply chains away from China. The epidemic's impact on China's economic and social development is temporary and generally manageable, but it will deal a relatively big blow in the short term, Xi said, according to Xinhua. Even as the world's second largest economy pulls out all stops to contain the outbreak, it is keen to revive its vast industry and economic machinery that has been running at breakneck pace for the last four decades, and contributed to social stability in the Communist nation. In the speech, Xi made calls for the businesses to get back to work and stressed on orderly resumption, with each region adopting a ""precise approach"" based on local health risks, according to the Xinhua translation. Stakes are high as the virus, recently named COVID-19, is set to batter China's first quarter economic growth and challenge the country's goal of eradicating poverty by 2020. It could also impact employment of fresh college graduates and hinder critical sowing activities for agriculture in spring. Officials at the China's National Development and Reform Commission said on Monday that the impact of new disease on the economy is rather great and its hit on employment ""not small,"" according to a CNBC translation. The difficulty for college graduates and agriculture workers will be greater, said You Jun, the assistant minister for human resources and social security. China says that some large enterprises are already getting up to speed. According to the National Development and Reform Commission on Monday, the rate of resumption of work for the iron and steel industry was at 67.4%, while that for nonferrous metals was at 86.3%. Food processing was back up at more than 70%, while coal mine production was back up at 76%, NDRC said. China will also roll out proactive fiscal and monetary policies, and targeted measures to help enterprises, said Xi on Sunday in what is seen as a sign of more aggressive measures to stimulate the economy. The People's Bank of China said last Friday that it could adjust the benchmark deposit rate, among other measures to support the economy. ” CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",finance

Ukraine has not recorded a single coronavirus case but the arrival last week of a planeload of evacuees from China, none of whom are believed to be infected, sparked violent protests outside the sanatorium where they were housed. Skaletska moved into the facility for the duration of their two-week quarantine. On Monday, wearing a mask and protective suit, she met the inmates, posting pictures on Facebook with the hashtag #IamnotafraidofthevirusIamwithyou. Her decision has attracted both praise and criticism from people who called it a publicity stunt. While she did not expect them, Skaletska told Reuters the brickbats did not bother her. If I let all this get into my head, I would not have been able to stand working in the ministry from the first week. There are bots, there are people who do not understand, they need somewhere to post their indignation, she said. Last Thursday people in the town of Novi Sanzhary, where the sanatorium is located, clashed with police and hurled projectiles at a convoy of buses carrying the arrivals from China.

While speaking to Reuters via Skype from the sanatorium, Skaletska got a call from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday evening. Everything is OK, I am not crying anymore, she told Zelenskiy, after stress and lack of sleep in the aftermath of the protests had brought her to tears. Moving to the sanatorium meant Skaletska missing her daughter's 10th birthday on Friday.

Today comes some big news that underscores how investors are doubling down on one of the big hopefuls for the next generation of chipmaking to see it through any possible winter winds. Graphcore, the Bristol-based startup that designs processors specifically for artificial intelligence applications, announced it has raised another $150 million in funding for R&D and to continue bringing on new customers. Its valuation is now $1.95 billion. Graphcore  has now raised over $450 million and says that it has some $300 million in cash reserves ” an important detail considering the doldrums that have plagued the chipmaking market in the last few months, and could become exacerbated now with the slowdown in production due to the coronavirus outbreak. The funding is an extension of its Series D, it said, and brings the total valuation of the company to $1.95 billion. (For reference, the original Series D in December 2018 valued Graphcore at $1.7 billion.) This latest round includes investments from Baillie Gifford, Mayfair Equity Partners and M&G Investments ” all new backers ” as well as participation from previous investors Merian Chrysalis, Ahren Innovation Capital, Amadeus Capital Partners and Sofina. Other past backers of the startup include BMW, Microsoft, Atomico and Demis Hassabis of DeepMind. Graphcore's big claim to fame has been the development of what it calls its Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) hardware and corresponding Poplar software, designed specifically for the kind of simultaneous, intensive calculations demanded of AI applications (which are designed based on how humans think, in parallel processing mode). Graphcore describes its IPU as the first processor to be designed specifically for AI. However, a number of other companies including Nvidia, Intel  and AMD have made huge investments into this area and have ramped up their pace of development to meet market demands ” and hopefully to overtake what have been limitations in the wider area of AI processing, a problem that still continues to persist. Deep learning has only really existed in since 2012, Nigel Toon,  founder and CEO, said recently to TechCrunch. When we started Graphcore, what we heard from innovators was that hardware was holding them back. This D2 round comes ahead of what Graphcore describes as strong demand for 2020, and is happening on the heels of a strong year for the company, including a commercial deal with one of its previous strategic backers. 2019 was a transformative year for Graphcore as we moved from development to a full commercial business with volume production products shipping, said Toon. We were pleased to publicly announce our close partnership with Microsoft  in November 2019, jointly announcing IPU availability for external customers on the Azure Cloud, as well as for use by Microsoft internal AI initiatives. In addition, we announced availability of the DSS8440 IPU Server in partnership with Dell Technologies and the launch of the Cirrascale IPU-Bare Metal Cloud.

"Ira Iosebashvili, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed",2/24/2020,reuters,ANALYSIS-Coronavirus concerns spur odd market moves,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-markets-assets/analysis-coronavirus-concerns-spur-odd-market-moves-idUSL1N2AJ1WK," - Some asset prices are moving together in unusual ways, an indication that investors may be preparing their portfolios for a coronavirus-led global slowdown. U.S. stocks, gold, Treasuries and the dollar have all surged in 2020, a climb that has taken place alongside persistent concerns over the outbreak's economic fallout. Such synchronous moves are not typical, as investors usually have different reasons for buying each asset class. A bullish bet on stocks, for example, is often a wager on stronger economic growth, while gold and bonds tend to find favor in more pessimistic times. That conventional wisdom has not applied this year. The S&P 500 is up 3.3% in 2020 and stands just off a record high despite Friday's drop, gold is up 8.3% and near its highest level in seven years while the U.S. Dollar Index is up 3% and hovering near a three-year high. Stocks, gold and the dollar have all notched yearly gains of 3% or more only twice in the past decade. Meanwhile, the 10-day rolling correlation between the dollar and gold stands at 0.6 ” higher than it has been more than 99% of the time over the last decade. Typically, a stronger dollar tends to pressure gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes more expensive for foreign buyers when the buck rises. Correlation is measured on a scale from minus one, which represents asset prices going in opposite directions, to plus one, indicating prices moving in perfect tandem. Several forces may be fueling the multipronged rally, analysts said. While investors are loathe to reduce their stock exposure”a losing strategy over the more than-decade-long bull market”many are buffering their portfolios with haven assets such as gold, bonds and the dollar in case the outbreak accelerates or its economic fallout is greater than expected. At the same time, investors are favoring U.S. stocks and bonds, as many expect the U.S. economy to be less vulnerable to a hit from the coronavirus than those in Asia and the eurozone. That has boosted the dollar while sending yields on some U.S. government bonds to record lows. Market participants are looking at U.S. assets as a safe haven no matter what asset class, said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. Many also expect the disruptions wrought by the outbreak to hit global growth and push central banks”including the Federal Reserve”to cut rates or introduce stimulus measures. Fed funds futures on Friday implied traders are pricing in a 59% chance of a rate cut at June's monetary policy meeting, compared with an implied probability of 17.5% at the start of the year. That is seen as positive for stock prices, which have been buoyed by years of low rates, as well as gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when rates rise. Bonds also become attractive because their prices rise when yields fall. Lockstep moves in asset prices sometimes concern investors. Assets that rose in tandem could be at risk of a sharp simultaneous reversal if investors decide all to sell at once. Such moves occurred when worries over China's economy triggered wide selloffs in 2015 and 2016. Others, however, are more optimistic. Denise Chisholm, sector strategist at Fidelity Investments, noted that markets saw declines in a broad range of assets in 2018, followed by rallies in most major asset classes the next year.

"Ira Iosebashvili, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed",2/24/2020,reuters,Coronavirus concerns spur odd market moves,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-assets-analysis/coronavirus-concerns-spur-odd-market-moves-idUSKCN20I0HX,"Some asset prices are moving together in unusual ways, an indication that investors may be preparing their portfolios for a coronavirus-led global slowdown. U.S. stocks, gold, Treasuries and the dollar have all risen in 2020 alongside persistent concerns over the outbreak's economic fallout. Such synchronous moves are not typical, as investors usually have different reasons for buying each asset class. A bullish bet on stocks, for example, is often a wager on stronger economic growth, while gold and bonds tend to find favor in more pessimistic times. That conventional wisdom has not applied this year. As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 3.3% in 2020 and stood close to a record high, gold was up 8.3% and near its highest level in seven years while the U.S. Dollar Index was up 3% and hovering near a three-year high. Stocks, gold and the dollar have all notched yearly gains of 3% or more only twice in the past decade. Stocks tumbled early Monday after a surge in coronavirus cases outside China stoked fears of a bigger impact to global economic growth, wiping out most of the S&P's gains for the year. Gold and Treasuries extended their rallies while the dollar was little changed. (Graphic: Stocks, dollar, gold rise in sync - here) The 10-day rolling correlation between the dollar and gold stood at 0.6 on Friday, higher than more than 99% of the time over the last decade. Typically, a stronger dollar tends to pressure gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes more expensive for foreign buyers when the buck rises. Correlation is measured on a scale from minus one, which represents asset prices going in opposite directions, to plus one, indicating prices moving in perfect tandem. (Graphic: Gold and U.S. dollar move together - here) Several forces may be fueling the multipronged rally, analysts said. While investors are loathe to reduce their stock exposure - a losing strategy over the more than-decade-long bull market - many are buffering their portfolios with haven assets such as gold, bonds and the dollar in case the outbreak accelerates or its economic fallout is greater than expected. At the same time, investors are favoring U.S. stocks and bonds, as many expect the U.S. economy to be less vulnerable to a hit from the coronavirus than those in Asia and the eurozone. That has boosted the dollar while sending yields on some U.S. government bonds to record lows. Market participants are looking at U.S. assets as a safe haven no matter what asset class, said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. Many also expect the disruptions wrought by the outbreak to hit global growth and push central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to cut rates or introduce stimulus measures. Fed funds futures on Monday implied traders were pricing in a roughly 75% chance of a rate cut at June's monetary policy meeting, compared with an implied probability of 17.5% at the start of the year. (Graphic: FOMC rate change probability - here) That is seen as positive for stock prices, which have been buoyed by years of low rates, as well as gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when rates rise. Bonds also become attractive because their prices rise when yields fall. Lockstep moves in asset prices sometimes concern investors. Assets that rose in tandem could be at risk of a sharp simultaneous reversal if investors decide all to sell at once. Such moves occurred when worries over China's economy triggered wide sell-offs in 2015 and 2016. Others, however, are more optimistic. Denise Chisholm, sector strategist at Fidelity Investments, noted that markets saw declines in a broad range of assets in 2018, followed by rallies in most major asset classes the next year.

Such a pandemic would rattle the global economy, leading to a recession as deep as the one in 2008/09, BCA Research's Peter Berezin wrote in a note . Demand for most items other than necessities would collapse. Business and leisure travel would fizzle. The global supply chain would seize up. There are now 79,407 cases of COVID-19 in 32 countries and 2,622 deaths, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). The number of new cases and deaths in China appear to be slowing, officials said; however, a sharp uptick in infections and fatalities in Iran (there are now a total of 47 cases and 12 deaths) and Italy (there are now a total of 124 cases and two deaths) troubled markets on Monday morning. COVID-19 now satisfies the definition of global pandemic (though not clear if WHO will label it as such) and widens [the] potential economic impact, Cowen analysts wrote Monday. WHO officials haven't done so. On Monday, they said that while the outbreak has the potential to become a pandemic, indicating there would be sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus on at least two continents, it has not yet reached that level . The last time WHO declared a pandemic was in 2009 for the H1N1 influenza, also called swine flu, which caused $1.1 billion in annual socioeconomic costs. We are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, told reporters. What we are seeing are epidemics in different parts of the world, affecting countries in different ways. However, Tedros said that the rise in cases in Iran, Italy and South Korea, which now has 833 infections and one death, is deeply concerning. The health organization shared new findings about the virus from the delegation it sent to China. The fatality rate in Wuhan, China, considered the epicenter of the outbreak, is between 2% and 4%. Outside of Wuhan, it is thought to be 0.7%. (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a fatality rate of 10%.) For mild cases, recovery can take two weeks, while severe cases may need up to six weeks to recover. Officials are expected to release additional information about the WHO visit to Hubei Province on Tuesday. Outside of mainland China, the countries with infection clusters have largely been able to tie transmission to specific events. In Singapore, that was a conference. In Japan, many cases were attributed to passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been docked at port in Yokohama, Japan. In Iran and South Korea, officials are looking into large gatherings of people attending religious events. Each country is a different dynamic, Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said during a news conference on Monday. What we don't understand yet in COVID-19 are the absolute transmission dynamics. In the U.S., there are 53 cases, a tally that includes the 39 people who were repatriated to the U.S. from the Diamond Princess and from Wuhan. Until recently, the majority of cases confirmed outside of China have been in people who have recently traveled to mainland China; for example, only two of the 14 cases diagnosed in the U.S. occurred after a local transmission. In both cases, it was a spouse of an individual who had recently traveled to China. That is similar to what officials are seeing in China. Most clusters there are in families, Ryan said. Here's what companies are saying about the COVID-19 impact: Ά L'OrΓ©al told investors that the impact from the outbreak will be temporary, based on the cosmetics maker's experience with the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. What is different about this outbreak, however, is L'OrΓ©al's e-commerce sales of beauty products in China are stronger so far in February than they were this month last year. This crisis will even strengthen the position of the e-commerce players in China, CEO Jean-Paul Agon told investors on Monday at an analyst conference. Ά Ascential PLC ASCL, +5.04% , an events company, told investors that Chinese investors make up less than 5% of its revenue and only 2% of attendees at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual advertising event held in June in the south of France. The company said it has not seen a material impact from the outbreak. I do think it is too early for us to say anything other than we don't expect from what we know today, any major impact on our major events, an executive said on its earnings call. Ά The Biotechnology Innovation Organization canceled the annual BIO Asia conference in Tokyo, which was scheduled to take place March 10 and 11 over COVID-19 concerns. Ά Trip.com TCOM, +1.43% , a Shanghai-based travel services company, rescheduled its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings to March 18 due to the evolving situation brought on by the novel coronavirus outbreak in China. Ά Shares of Zoom Video Communications Inc.

Find the collection here. Updated at 7:43 p.m. on Feb. 25, 2020. In May 1997, a 3-year-old boy developed what at first seemed like the common cold. When his symptoms”sore throat, fever, and cough”persisted for six days, he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. There his cough worsened, and he began gasping for air. Despite intensive care, the boy died. Puzzled by his rapid deterioration, doctors sent a sample of the boy's sputum to China's Department of Health. But the standard testing protocol couldn't fully identify the virus that had caused the disease. The chief virologist decided to ship some of the sample to colleagues in other countries. Read: What you can do right now about the coronavirus At the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the boy's sputum sat for a month, waiting for its turn in a slow process of antibody-matching analysis. The results eventually confirmed that this was a variant of influenza, the virus that has killed more people than any in history. But this type had never before been seen in humans. It was H5N1, or avian flu, discovered two decades prior, but known only to infect birds. By then, it was August. Scientists sent distress signals around the world. The Chinese government swiftly killed 1.5 million chickens (over the protests of chicken farmers). Further cases were closely monitored and isolated.

The government in Seoul put the country on high alert after the number of infections surged over 600 with six deaths. A focal point was a church in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a 61-year-old member of the congregation with no recent record of overseas travel tested positive for the virus. In Italy, officials said a third person infected with the flu-like virus had died, while the number of cases jumped to above 150 from just three before Friday. Authorities sealed off the worst affected towns and banned public gatherings in much of the north, including halting the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases, to try to contain the biggest outbreak in Europe. I was surprised by this explosion of cases, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told state broadcaster RAI, warning that the numbers would likely rise in the coming days. We will do everything we can to contain the contagion. Italian health authorities were struggling to find out how the virus started. If we cannot find patient zero' then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought, said Luca Zaia, the regional governor of the wealthy Veneto region. Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine. The European Union said it had confidence in the Italian authorities. We share concern for possible contagion (but) there is no need to panic, the bloc's Economic Affairs Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters. Iran, which announced its first two cases on Wednesday, said it had confirmed 43 cases and eight deaths, with most of the infections in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan imposed travel and immigration restrictions on the Islamic Republic. The virus has killed 2,442 people in China, which has reported 76,936 cases, and has slammed the brakes on the world's second largest economy.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China. For a graphic on tracking the novel coronavirus, click here China, which has seen the vast majority of cases, reported 648 new infections. But only 18 were outside of Hubei province, the lowest number outside the epicenter since authorities began publishing data a month ago and locked down large parts of the country. At present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage, President Xi Jinping said. State run television urged people to avoid complacency, drawing attention to people gathering in public areas and tourist spots without wearing masks. In South Korea, Catholic churches in Daegu and Gwangju have suspended services and other gatherings, while churches elsewhere saw declines in attendance on Sunday, especially among the elderly. If the situation gets worse, I think we'll need to take more measures, said Song Gi-young, 53, wearing a face mask at church. South Korea's president said raising the disease alert to the highest level, allowing authorities to send extra resources to Daegu city and Cheongdo county, which were designated special care zones on Friday. Health officials reported 169 new infections, bringing the total to 602. The potential economic impact of the disease was prominent at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Riyadh. The International Monetary Fund's chief said China's 2020 growth would likely be lower at 5.6%, down 0.4 percentage points from its January outlook, with 0.1 percentage points shaved from global growth. Xi highlighted the importance of fighting the epidemic in the capital Beijing, which has recently required people arriving from elsewhere in China to be quarantined at home for 14 days. He said it would have a relatively big, but short-term impact on the economy and that Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow. In Japan, where the government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the virus, authorities had confirmed 773 cases by early Sunday evening. Most of them were from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, the Diamond Princess. A third passenger, a Japanese man in his 80s, died on Sunday.

Jane Li,2/24/2020,qz,Wuhan reverses announcement of easing of coronavirus lockdown ” Quartz,https://www.qz.com/1807166/wuhan-reverses-announcement-of-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown/,"China's strategy of trying to project confidence that it has the coronavirus outbreak under control isn't going so well. In a confusing sequence of events today, the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, announced a policy of allowing some people there to leave in small groups, implying that the disease had been sufficiently contained to allow a relaxation of the lockdown. Yet three hours later, the decision was reversed. The notice (link in Chinese) of the easing came from a special government task force dedicated to containing the spread of the epidemic in the city where 9 million still remain. The new rules would have allowed non-local residents, or those who have other illnesses and need to be treated elsewhere, among others, to leave. They needed to be physically healthy with no coronavirus symptoms, said the now-deleted notice, and would have been required to under a 14-day quarantine in their new destinations. Some of those stuck in Wuhan include people who are struggling to get treatment (paywall) for non-coronavirus-related diseases, as most local hospitals are mandated to only receive patients with the coronavirus. The Wuhan task force then put out another notice revoking that announcement. The earlier notice was released by the transportation team which did not run the decision for study and approval through the task force and its major leaders¦ We have criticized and punished colleagues who were responsible for [releasing the notice] seriously, and will firmly implement president Xi Jinping's decree on preventing the export of the virus, read the later announcement (link in Chinese). In short: the local officials crossed more senior ones with their rash announcement, and would be duly punished. The confusion over the lockdown measures suggest ongoing divisions between local governments and the central government in Beijing in managing the crisis. For example, provinces such as Shandong have started encouraging companies (link in Chinese) to resume work through means including cash incentives, though Xi emphasized in a speech (link in Chinese) yesterday that the situation is still severe and complicated, and urged local governments not to relax containment measures. Senior party officials have also taken to assigning blame for the handling of the epidemic to local officials, for example by replacing two party officials in Hubei province, possibly in a bid to deflect rising criticism directed at Xi and the party more broadly. The initial announcement from the task force came amid an increasingly obvious effort on the part of Chinese authorities to communicate that the government succeeding in getting the coronavirus outbreak under control. Official statistics have shown a steady decrease in the number of new infections and deaths in recent days”though many experts continue to question the veracity of figures coming out of China, particularly as it has repeatedly changed its reporting methodology. The rapid spread of the disease in countries such as South Korea, Iran, and Italy is casting further doubt on whether the dramatically lower number of new cases coming out of China is believable. If anything should give further pause to the narrative that the disease is being well managed in China, however, it's the official cancellation of the most important meeting in the Communist Party's calendar. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, announced today that it would postpone the annual political meetings known as Two Sessions from early March due to the epidemic.",tech

Here's How to Prepare Your Company,https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/the-coronavirus-outbreak-could-change-way-you-work-heres-how-to-prepare-your-company.html,"Last month I wrote that the coming widespread rollout of 5G would change the way we work this year, and I still believe that's true. What I didn't account for at the time, however, is that there's another variableΒ likely to force many of us to make those changes much sooner than we may have thought. That's because as the current outbreak of COVID-19 approaches a global pandemic, companies are going to be faced with some difficult choices. In countries likeΒ China, where the virus originated, workplaces have already shut down in an effort to limit or slow the transmission of the disease. Apple, for example, has closed most of its stores in the country, and already announced that its quarterly revenue will fall short of its previous estimates due to a limit in supply resulting from shuttered factories. In reality, the question is no longer ""if,"" but ""when?"" For example, this Twitter thread includes a range of expert opinions that we're past that point. Round up of (assistant) profs of infectious disease spread saying we're likely past being able to contain coronavirus, i.e. headed for a pandemic and mitigation (NOT saying containment efforts are now pointless): @mlipsitch https://t.co/mP76jHPmGT1/2... Still, that doesn't mean it's time to panic. It means it's time to prepare. For many companies, preparation means putting a structure in place to enableΒ your team to continue working, even if we get to a point where they can't come to the office for a period of time. In fact, aΒ company that I work for experienced that very challenge last summer, though not as a result of any viral outbreak. Most of our team is already remote, but for three weeks in June, all 170 employees were working remotely. Here are a few of the things our company learned that you can use to prepare your team: If you aren't already allowing your team the flexibility to work remotely, start now. It'll be far easier to work out the systems and processes you need to put into place if you ease your way into remote work. It's hard to know exactly where the pain points will be until you suddenly realize that your regularly-scheduled team meeting won't be happening in person and you scramble to figure out how to get everyone together. Start practicing now by letting people work from home as their schedule and workload allow. This will give you insight into the areas you need to strengthen before you get to the point where you're looking at having everyone work remotely for a period of time. Making a change that involves sending your entire team home will no doubt be disruptive. You can minimize that disruption by setting firm objectives around the types of work that is required to keep things moving forward. It's important to recognize that those objectives may be different than they were when your team was in an office together. Instead, focus on the priorities that will empower your team to be productive in any environment. One of the benefits of technology is that it can help keep your team connected even when they aren't in the same physical location. This is especially important when it comes to collaborating and communicating across teams. Tools like Zoom and Slack don't replace face-to-face communicationΒ but they can help you develop a structure for staying engaged even as you work from home. You'll also want to think through the specific tools or devices your team will need. Will you provide them with a laptop and a smartphone, or are they expected to bring their own device? Either way, your preparation should include thinking this throughΒ and making sure your team has what it needs to keep working. The bottom line is that your structure has to reflect a level of trust in your people. Working remotely inherently requires letting go of a measure of control since you can't see what everyone is doing all the time. By the way, that's a good thing. If you find yourself anxious at the idea that your team will be working outside of your watchful eye, start by taking a deep breath. It's going to be OK. You hired this team for a reason, and now it's time to empower them to succeed.",business

One issue that may not be getting enough credit for the uneasiness on Wall Street is the troubling slide in bond market yields. The 30-year bond is at historic lows, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury is at levels not seen since the Brexit unrest in the summer of 2016. While that usually is a telltale sign that the market is pricing in low economic growth, the current dynamic is adding some twists that have investors unnerved. ""I don't think this would be nearly as dramatic this morning were it not for the bond market. This might have more to do with the bond market pushing on an all-time low,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. ""It opens up a whole new can of worms of whether bond yields can go negative in the United States."" The bond moves came amid a sharp sell-off in the stock market, with major indexes seeing losses of 2.5% or more in Monday morning trading. Negative nominal yields are prevalent across much of Europe and in Japan, involving about $11 trillion of global sovereign debt. The entire German yield curve traded in negative territory Monday. In the U.S., Federal Reserve officials have expressed doubt that government debt ever could see below-zero yields, a phenomenon that happens when bonds are priced so high above par that investors holding to duration receive below the principal amount at maturity. But as investors keep buying bonds and inflation expectations dim, the prospect of negative yields is rising. While borrowers benefit in that situation, banks suffer, and negative yields have done little to boost overall growth in the countries where they prevail. Paulsen, though, said the low rates in the U.S. may not be signaling low growth expectations but rather the belief that inflation will stay down for an extended duration. ""The message in the bond market may not be that much different in stocks,"" he said. ""Bond yields are down this year, but credit spreads have not widened. That tells me the bond market is saying inflation is down but growth is OK."" Still, the low yields are playing into fears expressed by Federal Reserve officials worried about inflation. Central bankers have been talking up inflation, trying to reach a 2% goal so they can keep short-term rates high enough to provide policy room in the case of a downturn. Markets, though, are looking for more rate cuts; futures traders on Monday were pricing in a 56% chance of a reduction by April, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The bond market trends also represent a tricky calculus for stock market investors. Normally, when stock prices are rising bond prices fall and yields rise as investors demand more of a premium for safe haven fixed income. However, that hasn't been the case lately, with the correlation between bond prices and stocks at a four-year high, according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Shalett said this is a case where ""this time has been different."" ""As rates have gone down, equity investors have redoubled their focus on how low rates will drive valuations higher, which is risky,"" she said in a note for clients. ""We see stock prices as vulnerable, so if interest rates were to back up suddenly, the diversification that bonds usually provide could fail."" For investors, Paulsen said it will be critical to watch spreads, or the difference between bonds of similar maturities but different credit quality. Widening spreads indicate greater market fear. ""If they stay in the range they've been in the last year, I think things will hold together,"" he said. Correction: Major indexes saw losses of 2.5% or more in Monday morning trading.

Jeff Cox@jeff.cox.7528@JeffCoxCNBCcom,2/24/2020,cnbc,'Dr. Doom' Nouriel Roubini warns of multiple 'white swans',https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/dr-doom-nouriel-roubini-warns-of-multiple-white-swans.html,"The deadly coronavirus is just one of several ""white swans"" circling the global economy that could present the biggest challenge since the financial crisis, according to economist Nouriel Roubini. The economist, who has been nicknamed ""Dr. Doom,"" pointed to a number of other issues that could be just as destabilizing. They include: geopolitical tumult across at least four fronts, a potentially chaotic presidential election, reignited trade tensions with China, potentially catastrophic damage from climate change and a growing potential of cyberwarfare. ""This list is hardly exhaustive, but it points to what one can reasonably expect for 2020,"" Roubini said in an essay for Project Syndicate. ""Financial markets, meanwhile, remain blissfully in denial of the risks, convinced that a calm if not happy year awaits major economies and global markets."" Markets, though, were anything but calm Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 1,000 points at its trough as investors fretted over the spreading coronavirus, record-low bond yields and a political landscape that could see a major party nominate a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, as its presidential candidate. All of these market challenges, in Roubini's view, are within the market's line of sight and thus contrast to the ""Black Swan"" scenario described by investor Nassim Taleb in his bestselling 2007 book of the same name. Taleb referred to events that are highly unpredictable and thus cause more damage. ""Beyond the usual economic and policy risks that most financial analysts worry about, a number of potentially seismic white swans are visible on the horizon this year,"" Roubini wrote. ""Any of them could trigger severe economic, financial, political, and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis."" Roubini earned his nickname in the run-up to the crisis and afterward for his frequent pessimism on markets and the economy. He has been a bit more sanguine in recent years, though he has said he thinks a recession is likely in 2020. In his post, published last week before news of the renewed cornavirus spread and Monday's market washout, Roubini said a U.S.-Iran war is ""likely this year,"" and said within a year the cold trade war between the U.S. and China ""could have escalated ... to a near-hot one."" He also sees ""costly environmental disasters"" due to climate change and the potential that China could dump its U.S. Treasury holdings amid heightened trade tensions. He also fears tensions between the U.S. and Russia and North Korea. Roubini's fears represent a worst-case scenario of what could bring down the longest economic expansion and bull market in U.S. history. The aggressive Monday sell-off aside, investors have not been as fearful. Prior to the past few trading days, markets had been taking the worries over coronavirus well, with 2020 off to a solid start. Just several months removed from worrying about recession, most economists had turned to expectations of slowing but still steady growth. A DataTrek Research survey of 294 mostly buy- and sell-side analysts reflects concern though not panic about the COVID-9 outbreak. For instance, about only 1 in 4 expected a virus-induced recession. But about a third expressed concern for their personal safety. ""That's an important market observation, because investors concerned about their personal health are more likely to have bearish assessments of its macro effects,"" wrote DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas. ""The combination of personal safety concerns about COVID-19 and uncertainty about potential near-term positive catalysts like Chinese containment likely means a continuation of Friday's volatility and further near-term declines for US/global equities."" Almost on cue, Monday saw a market sell-off that inspired fear over how deeply the coronavirus scare could spread in a market that had seen the S&P 500 reach its highest valuation level in almost 18 years just a week ago. ""There is room for further correction, there's no doubt about that,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment stratetgist at The Leuthold Group. ""But I still think the fundamentals under this are pretty good. We're improving. My guess is that we will be higher before this year's out. I think this is a temporary connection.""",finance

As the latest central bank official to indicate no desire for further easing policy, Mester also indicated she wouldn't be in favor of hiking rates either, even if inflation should overshoot the Fed's 2% target. ""My current view is that monetary policy is well calibrated to support our dual mandate goals, and a patient approach to policy changes is appropriate unless there is a material change to the outlook,"" Mester said in remarks delivered in Washington, D.C. Markets have been pressuring the Fed for more rate cuts, particularly as the coronavirus problem has worsened. Mester called the situation a ""downside risk"" to her economic forecast and said she and her colleagues will continue to watch developments. ""This might mean a larger negative impact on growth in China in the near term but perhaps a less protracted one,"" she said. ""At this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty is something I will be carefully monitoring."" In addition to dealing with broader growth questions, the Fed has been enmeshed in trying to prop up inflation. Mester's prescription entails allowing inflation to run ""somewhat above"" 2% without tightening, but not taking any steps to loosen policy. ""I would not favor that at this time,"" she said. ""In my view, doing so would raise the risk of generating imbalances that would threaten the expansion and undermine our employment goal."" She cited ""elevated"" prices for stocks and commercial real estate, high levels of corporate debt ad weak underwriting standards on leveraged loans that cutting rates could exacerbate.",finance

Those hopes appear to have been dashed. A spreading coronavirus in China and elsewhere is snarling global supply chains, making it harder to obtain parts for new autos, produce iPhones or cater to jet-setting tourists, among other things. The disruption is bound to hurt sales and production and make companies even more hesitant to invest in big new projects. The first major sign of the damage the viral outbreak is causing to the U.S. economy came last week from a survey of business executives. IHS Markit said its barometer of business conditions turned negative in February for the first time in four years. A number of companies including Apple AAPL, -0.59% also warned that sales could fall short of forecast. Read: What Apple, P&G, Walmart and Co. are saying about the coronavirus outbreak For weeks, most economic forecasters have been sticking to the view that corona-related disruptions would be temporary. Just last Friday, several senior Federal Reserve officials predicted the hit to the U.S. would be short one. Even if they are right, though, a big dose of uncertainty is suddenly clouding the economic outlook. The seemingly clear skies from last month have largely been obscured. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% sank by as much as 800 points in Monday trades and bond yields tumbled to fresh lows. The coronavirus is rapidly slowing the momentum of the global economy and sucking the oxygen out of financial markets, said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. Read: Economy softens on coronavirus worries, IHS Markit finds And: Industrial output slumps in January for fourth decline in past five months In more ordinary times, Wall Street would be zeroing in this week on the latest trends in business investment including the monthly report on durable goods when it is published Thursday. See: MarketWatch Economic Calendar Yet even if investment rebounded in January, and economists predict no gain, it's already old news. Investors want to know what happened in February after the viral epidemic captured headlines around the world. Instead they'll have to wait another month to learn the answer. By that time, the viral outbreak could be under control and the economic outlook could turn sunny again, but don't expect businesses to jump to any conclusions given the lack of progress so far in containing the COVID-19 outbreak. It could get a lot worse before the tide is turned. Clearly there are enough shockingly weak data points cropping up in China, and elsewhere to counsel caution in the face of this great unknown,' said Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. Another worry of business executives is the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist, could win the Democratic primary vote and to set up a showdown with President Trump in the November elections. The senator from Vermont appears to have taken a clear lead over his rivals early in the race. Sanders has promised to sharply raise business taxes and increase regulations if elected. Some companies say they've become more cautious in the face of growing uncertainty ahead of the presidential election later this year, according to chief business economist Chris Williamson of IHS Markit. The potential nomination of Sanders as the Democratic party's presidential candidate has caused one prominent Democratic-leaning Wall Street bigwig, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, to say he would find it hard to vote for Sanders.

Jesse Pound@jesserpound,2/24/2020,cnbc,Here's why the coronavirus market sell-off is happening now,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/heres-why-the-coronavirus-market-sell-off-is-happening-now.html,"The U.S. stock market's sharp sell-off on Monday came after coronavirus cases increased outside of China, but there were several other factors that may have helped send stocks downward. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both fell more than 3% on the day, with travel stocks and those with heavy reliance on supply chains in China and South Korea, such as Apple, falling more than the broader market. Strategists and technical analysts pointed to other signals in the market that helped fuel a sell-off that the outbreak had failed to trigger so far. A lack of market breadth is one area that showed weakness, JC O'Hara of MKM Partners said in a note to clients over the weekend. With the best performers this year being concentrated in a small group of tech stocks, a downturn for those stocks could result in a spill over to the broader market, O'Hara said. ""The market is becoming very narrow in terms of stocks that have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last three months. Currently, this is the smallest group of winners since the 2007 market top,"" O'Hara said in a note to clients over the weekend. O'Hara also noted that the market's slump at the end of last week brought the S&P 500 close to dropping below its 50-day moving average, a key level watched by technical traders. The index broke through that level on Monday as soon as trading began. Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies said in a note to clients that weakness in oil prices and emerging markets meant that stocks falling below similar indicators could signal a deflationary period across asset classes. Investor sentiment also seemed not to have priced in some of the risks from the outbreak, strategists said. The American Association of Individual Investors reported last week that 40.6% of investors were bullish, above the historical average of 38%. Bruce Bittles of Baird said in a note to clients on Monday that investors seemed too complacent in recent weeks, making the market susceptible to a pullback. ""Since there is so much uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus impact on the global economy, the optimism seems to have gotten ahead of itself leaving the markets vulnerable should the virus news worsen or global economic conditions deteriorate further,"" Bittles said. Another issue that could be spooking investors is the rise of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose win in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday firmly made him the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary. ""Saturday's caucus in Nevada saw Senator Bernie Sanders emerge as a big winner, demonstrating his ability to put together a broad coalition of supporters and demolishing the argument that he can't attract minority supporters,"" L. Thomas Block, Fundstrat's Washington policy strategist, said in a note. Many health care stocks fell on Monday after the big win for Sanders, whose Medicare-for-all plan would move Americans onto a government-run health insurance program and eliminate private insurance. Centene was one of the biggest losers on the day, plunging 9.4%. UnitedHealth Group and Humana were also pummeled, falling 7.8% and 6.3%, respectively. Additionally, the sell-off was not only limited to companies that seemed to be impacted by recent headlines. There was a broader move toward a risk-off mentality among investors. Stocks like Microsoft and Netflix, which have little to worry about in regards to supply chain issues in Asia, fell 4.3% and 3.0% respectively. Meanwhile, the yield for 10-year Treasurys hit a three-year low and the 30-year hit its lowest level ever as investors looked for safer assets. The least negative sector in the S&P 500 was utilities, at -1.16% for the day, another signal that investors were looking for safer opportunities for yield.",finance

""It's not the beginning of a bear market. It's a serious correction related to a fundamental development,"" Wien said in a ""Squawk Alley"" interview. ""The fundamental development will be corrected ultimately, and the market will resume its previous direction, which was positive."" U.S. equity markets opened lower on Monday after a weekend of reports that the coronavirus was spreading more rapidly outside of mainland China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 800 points, or 2.75%, while Wien was speaking. The index closed down more than 1,000 points, or 3.56%. Wien said the market has been primed for a pullback recently. ""The market was vulnerable to a 5% to 10% correction at any given time. Maybe we're getting it now. I don't think it's the end of the world. I think the virus will be brought under control,"" Wien said. Wien said in his ""Ten Surprises"" note earlier this year that the U.S. markets would see several corrections of 5% or more during the year, but he still predicted the S&P 500 would finish the year at 3,500. Even with the virus outbreak hurting economic growth for at least the first quarter, Wien said the domestic and global economies could still have a solid year. ""The U.S. was doing very well in spite of the virus. I think if the virus is brought under control the world economy will continue to expand,"" Wien said.",finance

""On a day like today, people, for the most part, are making market-wide reactions. They're not discriminating,"" Marks said on CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" ""When things are placid, people make distinctions. When there's panic, they take them out and shoot them all."" The major U.S. stock indexes fell more than 3%  on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 1,000 points. The pullback was widely spread, with decliners at the New York Stock Exchange outnumbering advancers nine to one, according to FactSet. Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, said investors tend to be too optimistic or too pessimistic about economic conditions. ""A week or two ago, people thought it was flawless. And now today they think it's hopeless,"" Marks said. The market has sold off amid rising fears about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on economic growth. There were more 79,000 confirmed cases of the virus around the world, with new cases in Italy and South Korea accelerating over the weekend. Marks said that the market is slightly expensive compared with historical levels and that he is unsure what the impact of the coronavirus outbreak will be. ""What I've been saying for months is that I'm afraid to be in the market today. I'm also afraid to be out,"" Marks said. Marks, whose firm has about $125 billion in assets under management and is mostly invested in the credit market, said there was not one specific area that he thought offered a great buying opportunity. ""They're are no screaming bargains today. It's all a matter of finding the examples within each asset class that are a little more attractive than the others,"" Marks said. Marks also said that he would support former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's presidential run and would be open to a higher personal income tax rate and a financial transactions tax.",finance

Once a fan of the $20 Samsung SCH-U320, Buffett is now using Apple's latest iPhone 11. He's been a longtime user of the flip phone, even though Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest business, behind insurance and railroads. Now, he said, the flip phone is ""permanently gone"" even though he admitted he mostly uses the iPhone for phone calls.

Then, just as heavy rain began to bring the situation under control, came the coronavirus outbreak in China “ now the top source of international visitors to Australia. Tourism from China, already greatly reduced, ended with the ban on non-citizens travelling from China. 


      Read more:
      We depend so much more on Chinese travellers now. That makes the impact of this coronavirus novel


 The general assumption has been that, once the immediate crises are over, Australia's tourist numbers will bounce back.  Optimists point to examples such as Japan following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 15,000 people, resulted in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and forced more than 500,000 people to evacuate.  Tourism to Japan took a hit. International visits in 2011 fell 28%, to 6.2 million from 8.6 million in 2010. By the end of 2012, however, numbers were back to more than 8.3 million. Tourism to the devastated Fukushima region took a little longer to bounce back, but by fiscal 2015 had recovered to nearly 90% of numbers in fiscal 2010.   The same was true of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that wreaked catastrophic damage and killed an estimated 230,000 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and other countries in the Indian Ocean region.  Terrorist attacks in major cities have a similar immediate impact on travel, but this soon dissipates. There are, however, good reasons to think this time is different. First, most disasters of this kind have been single-day events. Relief efforts and  damage assessments can dominate the news for a week or more, but other events soon take their place.  By contrast, Australia's bushfire emergency ran for months, generating extensive worldwide coverage for much of this time. The COVID-19 outbreak epidemic is still front-page news and will probably remain so until it has been contained. Second, the typical shock of this kind has no long-term effect on perceptions of the country where it takes place. The vulnerability of the Pacific Rim to earthquakes and tsunamis has long been known, and the occurrence of an earthquake in Japan does not make another one any more likely (if anything the opposite).  Similarly, terrorist attacks can and do happen anywhere. While there are countries where terrorism risks discourage most tourists “ Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria being the top four “ in most of the world no possible destination is more or less at risk than any other, and the risk remains even if you stay at home.    By contrast, the bushfire cataclysm has been unprecedented in terms of duration and the areas in southeast Australia destroyed. Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra were all cloaked in smoke.  The image of Australia as a clean, green destination for outdoor fun “ promoted in an advertising campaign in Britain featuring Kylie Minogue even as the disaster raged “ has been replaced by burnt-out landscapes where the next fire may be even worse than the last.

      Celebrity concern about bushfires could do more harm than good. To help they need to put boots on the ground


 The Australian government's handling of the issue has added to negative perceptions. International coverage of the bushfires has repeatedly mentioned the coal-loving Australian government's failure to deal with the fact its fossil fuel exports contribute to the conditions that make catastrophic fires more likely.  It's a rude dose of reality for Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a former tourism-promotion bureaucrat whose lackadaisical, image-obsessed initial response to the fires has caused him to be lampooned on social media as #scottyfrommarketing.  And yet a generation before Morrison came on the scene, Australia was already lying to itself and the world about its role in the climate change that has fuelled this disaster. If any goodness can sprout from the devastation of these fires, it will start with a more honest reckoning about how successive governments have sold off Australia's future for a handful of coal. Finally, the bushfires affected as many tourists as locals. The fires in southern New South Wales and eastern Victoria in particular trapped thousands of tourists taking Christmas-New Year holidays in normally pleasant seaside resorts. This is not usually the case with disasters, with some exceptions. Most of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings were tourists, for example, as were the majority of more than 4,000 people killed in Thailand by the Boxing Day tsunami.

Jonathan Shieber,2/24/2020,techcrunch,Karius raises $165 million for its liquid biopsy technology identifying diseases with a blood draw,https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/karius-raises-165-million-for-its-liquid-biopsy-technology-identifying-diseases-in-a-drop-of-blood/,"What Karius is good at is identifying those novel microbes before they become an outbreak like coronavirus, says Mickey Kertesz, a chief executive whose life sciences startup just hauled in $165 million in new funding. While the new money may have been raised under the looming threat of Covid 19, the company's technology is already being used to test for infection-causing pathogens in immunocompromised pediatric patients, and for potential causes of complex pneumonia, fungal infections and endocarditis, according to a statement from the company.  Liquid biopsy technology has been widely embraced in cancer treatments as a way to identify which therapies may work best for patients based on the presence of trace amounts of genetic material in a patient's bloodstream that are shed by cancer cells. Karius applies the same principles to the detection of pathogens in the blood ” developing hardware and software that applies DNA sequencing and machine learning techniques to identify the genetic material that's present in a blood sample. As the company explains, microbes infecting the human body leave traces of their DNA in blood, which are called microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA). The company's test can measure the cell-free DNA of more than 1,000 clinically relevant samples from things like bacteria, DNA viruses, fungi and parasites. These tests indicate the types of quantities of those pathogens that are likely affecting a patient.  We're through the early stages of adoption and clinical studies show that the technology literally saves lives, says Kertesz. Its early successes were enough to attract the attention of SoftBank, which is backing the company through capital raised for its second Vision Fund. While SoftBank has been roundly criticized for investing too much too soon (or too late) into consumer startups which have not lived up to their promise (notably with implosions at Brandless, Zume and the potential catastrophe known as WeWork), its life sciences investing team has an impressive track record. They have the experience and the expertise and the network that's very relevant to us, Kertesz said of the decision to take SoftBank's money. That's the team that was on the board of Guardant Health [and] 10X Genomics. Both of those companies have proven to be successful in public markets and with validated technology. That's a feature Karius shares. The company's published an analytical and clinical validation of its test in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Microbiology showing that its test identified more quickly and more accurately the likely pathogens causing an infection when compared to standard methods.  With initial validation behind it, the company raised its new cash to pursue rapid commercial adoption for its tests and to continue validating applications of its technology while exploring new ones. Among the primary areas of exploration is the identification of new biomarkers, which could serve as indicators for new diseases (like Covid 19). As humanity we haven't figured out infectious diseases yet, said the company chief technology officer, Sivan Bercovici.  For the microbial signatures that our technology can't identify, we continuously bring in additional high-quality genomic blueprints from public databases, and we separately aggregate that data in a pool we call  dark matter for further investigation. One of the biggest challenges is how to know that you simply don't know, Karius  works by digitizing the microbial information in a blood sample and uses machine learning and DNA  sequencing to recognize the microbial signatures. The company uses public databases that have records of over 300,000 pathogens. For the ones that the company can't identify, it creates a identifier for those as well. At $2,000 per test, Karius' biopsies aren't cheap, but they're safer and more cost-effective than surgeries, according to Kertesz. It's obviating the need to dig into a patient for a piece of tissue and the technology is already being used in more than 100 hospitals and health systems, the company said. With that kind of reach, new investors, including General Catalyst  and HBM Healthcare Investments, were willing to sign on with SoftBank's Vision Fund and previous investors like Khosla Ventures and LightSpeed Venture Partners to participate in the latest round. Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of deaths worldwide. Karius' innovative mcfDNA technology accurately diagnoses infections that cannot be determined by other existing technologies, said Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.",tech
Jonathan Stempel,2/24/2020,reuters,"Warren Buffett calls coronavirus outbreak 'scary stuff,' but says he won't be selling stocks",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett/warren-buffett-calls-coronavirus-outbreak-scary-stuff-but-says-he-wont-be-selling-stocks-idUSKCN20I1AB,"Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Monday called the coronavirus outbreak scary stuff but said that it was no time to sell stocks despite the threat of a pandemic. Speaking on CNBC, Buffett said investors with a 10- to 20-year time horizon and focused on companies' earnings power will fare well in stocks, and that the outbreak has not changed his long-term outlook. It is scary stuff, Buffett said. I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks. Markets worldwide fell on Monday on concern about how the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, which began in China and has spread to countries including Italy, South Korea and Iran, could disrupt supply chains and slow global economic growth. Buffett, however, said long-term investors should not get caught up in daily headlines, and that Berkshire would certainly be more inclined to buy stocks than on Friday. If you look at the present situation, he said, you get more for your money in stocks than bonds. He said this was true though the U.S. economy, while sill strong, had become a little softer than it was six months ago. The economy grew 2.3% last year but has experienced slower consumer spending and industrial production. Buffett spoke two days after Berkshire said operating profit fell 3% in 2019 to $23.97 billion, hurt by losses from insurance underwriting, while unrealized gains in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other investments boosted net income to a record $81.42 billion. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has more than 90 operating businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer and Dairy Queen ice cream, and Buffett said the coronavirus outbreak has affected a significant number. Many of the roughly 1,000 Dairy Queens in China are closed, while those that are open aren't doing any business to speak of, Buffett said, while Johns Manville insulation and Shaw carpeting have seen supply chain disruptions. There's always trouble coming, he said. The real question is where are those businesses going to be in five or 10 years. Berkshire's stock price has trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX over the last decade, and Buffett said it will not trounce the broader market as it once did, in part reflecting its size and roughly $558 billion market value. Buffett said Berkshire over the long term is unlikely to be in the top 15% or bottom 30% of stocks, but will outperform in down markets. Any long-term outperformance will be minor, but it will be done in a very very safe manner, he said.

Jonathan Stempel,2/24/2020,reuters,Rising stocks fuel record profit for Buffett's Berkshire; operating profit disappoints,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-results/rising-stocks-fuel-record-profit-for-buffetts-berkshire-operating-profit-disappoints-idUSKCN20G0JE,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Saturday posted a 23% decrease in quarterly operating profit, while soaring prices in stock holdings such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) enabled the conglomerate to smash its old record for full-year earnings. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett defended Berkshire's foray into stocks, which comes amid a four-year drought since its last major acquisition that has left Berkshire sitting on $128 billion of cash. Berkshire did step up repurchases of its own stock, buying back roughly $2.2 billion in the quarter. Repurchases totaled $5 billion for the full year. I am delighted with the increased commitment to share repurchases, said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests $13 billion, of which 13% is in Berkshire. It may be a very large arrow in Berkshire's quiver to increase intrinsic value on a per-share basis. Nonetheless, while the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units showed improvement, reinsurance operations weighed on operating results, and the Geico car insurer posted subpar performance as loss claims eclipsed premium growth, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. The big miss was on the insurance front, though energy and railroads were stronger, Seifert said. It will be interesting see the impact of coronavirus on freight traffic in the first quarter and beyond. Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to $4.42 billion, or approximately $2,720 per Class A share, from $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per share. Berkshire did not write down its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), which is struggling to rebound from years of cost-cutting amid changing consumer tastes, though its market value is well below the $13.8 billion carrying cost on Berkshire's balance sheet. Net income, reflecting stock gains, totaled $29.16 billion, compared with a net loss of $25.39 billion a year earlier. For all of 2019, net income totaled $81.42 billion, topping the record $44.94 billion for 2017, when Berkshire benefited from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Such huge swings stem from an accounting rule requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income. Buffett wrote that companies whose stocks Berkshire owns are generating returns that are remarkable under any circumstances, especially compared with returns on bonds. Apple soared 86% in 2019 and 31% in the fourth quarter alone, leaving Berkshire with a $73.7 billion year-end stake. Berkshire's stock was a laggard in 2019, rising 11% compared with a 31.5% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, in part reflecting the drag from the cash stake.

Jordan Novet@jordannovet,2/24/2020,cnbc,HP (HPQ) earnings Q1 2020,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/hp-hpq-earnings-q1-2020.html,"HP shares moved as much as 6% higher in extended trading on Monday after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and  earnings guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. The company also announced an expansion of its share buyback authorization. Here's how the company did: HP's revenue declined 0.6% on an annualized basis in the quarter, which ended on January 31, according to a statement. The new strategic and financial value creation plan comes as HP faces Xerox's repeated efforts to buy the company. The most recent proposal from Xerox ""meaningfully undervalues HP, creates significant risk, and compromises HP's future,"" HP said in a statement. HP said it's ""reaching out to Xerox to explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP's strategic and financial plan."" Shares of Xerox were up 1% after hours. The repurchasing move is not a surprise. HP had said earlier that on Monday it would provide new details on driving shareholder value, including drawing on its balance sheet. The board has now authorized $15 billion for share repurchases, up from the $5 billion authorization announced in October. In total, HP is now aiming to return about $16 billion to shareholders between fiscal years 2020 and 2022. For the fiscal first quarter, HP's revenue from Personal Systems, the segment including PCs, totaled $9.89 billion, up 2% and falling short of the $10.52 billion estimate among analysts surveyed by FactSet. Printing segment revenue came out to $4.72 billion, down 7% and lower than the $4.85 billion FactSet consensus estimate. With respect to guidance, HP said it expects 49 cents to 53 cents in earnings per share in the fiscal second quarter, excluding certain items. The middle of range, at 51 cents, is less than the 54 cents per share that analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected. For the full 2020 fiscal year HP called for $2.33 to $2.43 in earnings per share, excluding certain items. The middle of the range, at $2.38, tops the $2.25 Refinitiv consensus estimate. HP also issued earnings guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. It's calling for $3.25 to $3.65 per share, excluding certain items. The middle of that range, $3.45, is well above the $2.35 Refinitiv consensus. HP announced new long-term target operating margins of 3.5% to 5.5% for its Personal Systems unit and 16% to 18% in the Printing segment. Xerox's efforts to acquire HP, which is worth more than four times Xerox, have been public since November. HP sees Xerox, which makes printers and scanners, as a competitor in the printing part of its business. On a conference call on Monday, though, HP CEO Enrique Lores said ""there is no overlap between Xerox and over 90% of HP's business."" On Thursday HP said its board had adopted a shareholder rights plan that ""should encourage Xerox (or anyone else seeking to acquire the Company) to negotiate with the Board prior to attempting to impose some combination that is not in the best interests of the HP shareholders."" Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has positions in both HP and Xerox, criticized HP's board in December for turning down Xerox's offer to buy the company for $22 per share. ""Over the years, I have seen many obvious 'no-brainers' that would greatly enhance value and have worked hard to facilitate these, but I can say without exaggeration that the combination of HP and Xerox is one of the most obvious no-brainers I have ever encountered in my career “ one where activism should not even be necessary at all because the merits of the combination are so obvious to everybody involved,"" he wrote in a letter to HP shareholders. In January Xerox said it would nominate 11 people to replace HP's board. And on February 10 Xerox raised its offer to $24 per share, or about $34 billion. ""We believe that consolidation in the space is much needed, but remain skeptical of the financial position of a combined HPQ/Xerox, as it will significantly leverage the firm, while also offering limiting growth opportunities,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, who has a buy rating on HP stock, wrote in a note distributed to clients on the day Xerox boosted the offer. Lores addressed the coronavirus on Monday's call. ""We are actively working to return to full production as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""We are working with our logistics providers to ensure we get the necessary capacity to meet customer demand. Overall, we are viewing the situation as temporary in nature, and we are aggressively navigating the challenges."" The company expects to see an impact from coronavirus in fiscal second-quarter results, Lores said. The coronavirus impact could delay effects from companies upgrading to PCs running Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system, which could lead to better results in the second half of the 2020 fiscal year, finance chief Steve Fieler said on Monday's call. Shares of HP were up 8% since the start of the year before Monday's after-hours rally. WATCH: HP adopts 'poison pill' to fend off Xerox's takeover attempt",finance

Chip Stocks Are Tumbling. Analyst Says Coronavirus Risk Is Growing. Shares of Gilead (ticker: GILD) were up 3.7% at midday. Remdesivir is not yet approved to treat any disease, though animal research suggests it is active against MERS and SARS, both of which are closely related to COVID-19 , the new coronavirus. Studies have been initiated in China to test the drug in coronavirus patients. The news came as fears that the epidemic is spreading quickly outside of China rocked markets on Monday, knocking the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 3.4% by midday. Aylward delivered his comments while wearing a surgical mask at a briefing in China on the country's response to COVID-19. He said that delays in enrolling patients in an ongoing study in China, reported last week by The Wall Street Journal , indicated that world health authorities were not focused enough on the therapies with the best chance of success. The struggle to recruit patients was not just because the numbers are falling, but because we are doing lots of other studies with things that are less promising, Aylward said. And we have got to start prioritizing enrollment into those things that may save lives and save them faster. And that's a global issue. Aylward's comments were reported earlier by Bloomberg News . Gilead shares are currently up 11.3% so far this year. Analysts have previously written that it is not clear whether a treatment for COVID-19 would constitute a significant financial benefit for Gilead. This little bit of time can be so important, Aylward said. We will gain a bit of time, but we have to be using that time better than we are today. Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com",business

The dollar index, which measures the greenback versus a basket of major currencies, rose by around 0.8% last week, before slipping back Friday following some disappointing economic data. On Monday the index was trading flat around 99.244, although since mid-January when the outbreak of the new coronavirus took hold, the dollar index is up around 2%. In an outlook note entitled ""The dollar way or the highway,"" ING strategists flagged an ""alternative perspective"" behind the recent dollar strength: ""that investors are quintessentially lacking alternatives in the G-10 space."" ""A rebound in the most exposed currencies to China may still not be a story for next week (even if risk recovers), while grim data should keep JPY (yen) and EUR (euro) unable to recover,"" Francesco Pesole, forex strategist at ING, said in the note published Friday. ""With no alternatives in G-10, the dollar can hold on to its throne for now."" On Monday he reiterated that ""the dollar remains the currency of choice in G-10 space."" JPMorgan analysts Daniel P Hui and Benjamin Shatil highlighted that although foreign exchange markets had in some ways reacted to the new coronavirus outbreak in the expected risk-on/risk-off manner, there was a ""troubling development whereby some 'safe haven' currencies have been anything but."" The Japanese yen, for instance ” traditionally viewed as another safe-haven currency ” has been hit hard by the spread of the virus. Indeed, the strength of the dollar index last week was driven by a sharp move higher in USD/JPY. As of Sunday, Japan had 132 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the World Health Organization, which included 27 new cases compared to the day before. On Monday, the dollar slipped 0.9% to 110.64 yen, but was still up around 0.7% over the last seven days. JPMorgan's Hui and Shatil argued that the list of viable safe currencies had narrowed to just the Swiss franc and U.S. dollar, with the yen no longer a defensive play. ""The bias is for the default USD bid to persist on risk of further growth downgrades and chronic Japanese and European weakness,"" the analysts said on Friday. Speaking to CNBC Monday, David Pierce, director at GPS Capital Markets, agreed that the safe-haven play was proving tricky for investors across different asset markets. ""It's not just the dollar, it's the Treasurys that have been very safe. And we're seeing a lot of money coming out of equity and into more long-term stable-type investments like bonds,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs."" ""The dollar has obviously been one that has been really strong for us ¦ People are really looking for safe havens and it's a tough find right now."" On Monday, a flight to U.S. Treasury bonds pushed yields ” which move inversely to prices ” sharply lower. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 1.37%, its lowest level since 2016.",finance
Katrina Turrill,2/24/2020,express,Coronavirus cure: Does a vaccine exist? Who will be first to get the vaccine?,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1246500/coronavirus-cure-vaccine-update-symptoms," Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks have continued to expand in South Korea and Italy over the last week. As of Monday, there were at least 77,150 confirmed in mainland China, where the virus originated, bringing the global total to more than 79,000. In some places, coronavirus has also proven deadly, with the death toll currently sitting at 2,620. But is there a cure for coronavirus? Is there a vaccine that can help prevent people getting the virus, stopping its widespread? A vaccine to prevent coronavirus is yet to exist, but Professor Stephen Turner from Monash University, said there are a now a number of initiatives that are aiming to develop new vaccines for the COVID-19 virus. This includes the CEPI initiative (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation). So how easy it for a vaccine to be developed? READ MORE: Coronavirus symptoms: How to tell if it's not cold or flu - the key signs you have virus  Professor Turner said: In principle, it is relatively straight forward to design and do preclinical testing of novel vaccine platforms, there are many new technologies being developed. The difficulty is getting such platforms into humans. There are many steps before any vaccine is approved for human use. It has to be shown to be safe, as well as effective. How long it will take for a vaccine to be administered is a hard question according to Professor Turner, as it depends on any vaccine candidate meeting regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness. He added: There is the capacity to fast track experimental vaccines where there is a really public health need/public health imperative. There is a recent example of rapid testing of a new Ebola virus vaccine. So who will be first to get the vaccine? First responders, health care workers and public health officials will most likely be first in line to get the vaccine to help treat those infected.  Professor Turner added: It's then likely those most at risk from COVID-19 to be given the vaccine, for example the elderly and those with underlying issues such as respiratory/cardiovascular problems. Coronavirus has three main symptoms, these are: The NHS is advising you call 111 if you've been:  You shouldn't go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. You should call 111, stay indoors and avoid close contact with other people. As there's currently no vaccine for coronavirus, the NHS is also advising things you should do to avoid catching or spreading germs.

It's one thing to price in a massive first-quarter growth hit from China being shut down (Goldman estimates a 0.8-point drag on the U.S.), and another when you have to add the rest of the world's biggest economies to that list. Your bright spots in the market today pretty much sum things up: Zoom is up 6%, because why ever hold a conference in person again? And Gilead is up 5% after a WHO official said at a briefing in Beijing that its experimental drug remdesivir is ""one drug right now that we think may have efficacy."" We'll have a whopper of a show today covering every possible facet of the story and, importantly, getting the latest reports from China, Italy, and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield is sinking back to almost record lows. It's trading under 1.37% as I write this, and I believe the all-time low is somewhere around 1.31%. We started the year at 1.9%! What's that going to mean for the U.S. housing market if the economy actually keeps chugging along? Housing, recall, is already plagued by shortages of affordable homes in particular. Plunging rates could worsen that, while not helping in new buyers who don't have enough for 20% downpayments. I'm starting to like the Mark Grant (of B. Riley FBR) line: it's a ""Borrower's Paradise*."" His recommendation to investors on the other side of that is to consider quality closed-end mutual funds. But I just keep thinking about what longer-term distortions this is creating, especially since yields are global now but their impact is local. And let's not forget the other big news out of the weekend: Bernie Sanders' big step towards being the Democratic party presidential candidate. I think it's not so much that his supporters are unaware of his Communist sympathies as willing to overlook them in order to advance--most importantly--Medicare For All. Most people I follow are dismissing M4A as pie-in-the-sky, never-gonna-happen nonsense, but I'm not so sure. If voters in this country want government-run healthcare badly enough to advance Bernie, I actually think it's probably going to happen here soon enough. And why not now? You certainly wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Remember--it's a Borrower's Paradise. See you at 1 p.m! Kelly *Who wants to write the song? P.S.--The Exchange is now a podcast!

The proposed spending deal could be sent to Congress as soon as this week, the source said. The Washington Post first reported the White House's preparations Monday morning. The Post reported that the package could include a request for about $1 billion in funding ” but that amount should not be considered the last word as plans are still being finalized, CNBC's source said. The coronavirus has killed at least 2,600 people around the world and infected tens of thousands so far. The World Health Organization declared the virus a global health emergency last month. The Trump administration in late January imposed travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines for at-risk citizens returning to the U.S. A White House official told CNBC on Monday that President Donald Trump is receiving ""regular updates"" on the virus. ""This is obviously a priority and the president is paying close attention. There have already been cases in the U.S. and person-to-person transmission in the U.S. One of the things the U.S. and President Trump have been able to do is to have policies and systems in place to make sure we're on top of it,"" the official said. ""It was briefly in the wild in the U.S. and we were able to pull that back,"" according to the official. Trump himself tweeted later Monday that ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA."" He added that the stock market ” which had just closed its worst trading session in two years ” is ""starting to look very good to me!""  A recent spike in the number of people infected with the deadly coronavirus has shaken governments and markets alike. Stocks tanked Monday amid the surge in cases outside of China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus. The White House official told CNBC that the market is reacting to the news of the day, and said that the economy remains strong. ""The idea that the Dow dropping 800 points currently is somehow an indictment of the president and his policies, I think that is ridiculous,"" the official said.",finance
Kevin Stankiewicz@kevin_stank,2/24/2020,cnbc,Jim Cramer: Investors can stay in market after coronavirus sell-off,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/jim-cramer-investors-can-stay-in-market-after-coronavirus-sell-off.html,"Investors should remain in the market despite Monday's major coronavirus-induced sell-off, CNBC's Jim Cramer said. ""Stay in. Stay in,"" Cramer said on ""Closing Bell."" ""We're getting a comprehensive decline. I think you can start buying the staples tomorrow."" The ""Mad Money"" host reiterated his belief that drug companies remain attractive in the current market conditions. ""You just don't want to be in the cross hairs of what I regard as being anything that's made in China or anything travel,"" he said, pointing to sectors such as hotels, airlines and cruise operators. Oil stocks are also ""so wrong,"" he said. Cramer's comments came shortly after the bell Monday, a session in which all three major U.S. indexes closed down more than 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1,031.61 points lower, marking its biggest point drop since February 2018. The S&P 500 dropped 3.35% to 3,225.89 en route to its worst day in two years, essentially wiping out the index's year-to-date gains. The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.71% to conclude the session at 9,221.28. The sell-off came in response to news that coronavirus cases were surging across the globe, particularly in South Korea and Italy. The vast majority of the more than 79,400 cases are still in mainland China, but the recent spread to other countries has investors grappling with the potential for global economic slowdown. Cramer has said he did not believe Wall Street was fully grasping the magnitude of the coronavirus. ""The virus is totally underrated,"" he said late last week. Cramer said on Monday that last week's market moves, which saw industrial stocks such as Illinois Tool Works run to the upside, showed investors were ""nuts in what was being bought."" ""I mean, how could Illinois Tool Works be hitting like its all-time high last week?"" he said. But Monday's pullback gives investors a chance to consider their strategies, Cramer said. ""Now we're going to come down and people have to start thinking about their time horizon,"" he said. ""Remember you don't make much money in bonds. You're going to get the [buying] opportunities that you haven't had that you should have gotten."" Cramer said he realized not every investor may have a lot cash to deploy into the opportunistic corners of the market. That is a fixable problem, though. ""I think it's still not to late sell if you don't have any cash,"" he said.",finance

""I look at these drug companies and I think, 'Wouldn't that be a great place to go if the market really falls apart?'"" Cramer said. ""They're so good and they haven't come down."" Earlier Monday, Cramer tweeted that the sell-off in response to the deepening coronavirus outbreak indicated further negative effects on U.S. multinational companies' earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw significant declines as the virus's outbreak takes deeper roots outside of mainland China, where a vast majority of the cases are located. Coronavirus cases have risen in Italy, now home to the largest outbreak outside of Asia. There also are now more than 830 cases and seven deaths in South Korea as the country's authorities raised their alert to the ""highest level."" On ""Squawk on the Street,"" Cramer pointed to Gilead Sciences as one potential buying opportunity, noting it has a drug being used in a coronavirus trial. Shares of the biopharmaceutical company were up more than 4% early Monday, standing in contrast to markets around the globe that are falling due to increased concerns about the coronavirus. The ""Mad Money"" host said there is much uncertainty around the fate of Gilead's antiviral remdesivir as a possible treatment for coronavirus. But he noted that a World Health Official on Monday suggested the drug may prove effective. ""If Gilead works, anybody who sells here is going to say, 'Why did I sell it when there was such ingenious science going on?'"" Cramer said. In general, he cautioned investors against buying heavily into Monday's declines. ""If the world slows, you're going to regret that you bought heavily here unless you're going to [be] buying Merck,"" Cramer said, referencing the potential benefits of the pharmaceutical company's Keytruda to treat cancer. GlaxoSmithKline is another example of a stock that could remain attractive, Cramer said. He said the British pharmaceutical company has new developments around its anti-cancer efforts and it maintains a strong dividend yield. ""If you own companies that are directly in harm's way, maybe you sell some. But then you redeploy into things that are just kind of bulletproof,"" Cramer said. ""Do you want to sell a drug company that may be working?"" Disclaimer",finance

According to Apple's website, 29 of Apple's 42 retail stores in Mainland China have re-opened, although many are operating on limited hours. Earlier this month, Apple temporarily shuttered all of its stores and corporate offices in China due to ""an abundance of caution."" Last week, Apple warned that it would miss its $63 billion to $67 billion estimate for March quarter revenue due to the coronavirus and efforts to mitigate its effect. Apple pointed to the closure of its stores in China as well as limited hours and low customer traffic as reasons why demand for Apple products on the mainland had been affected. Apple also warned at the time that iPhone supply could be constrained due to issues with manufacturing in China. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note on Monday that Apple's iPhone sales in China were up 5% year over year in January, significantly outperforming the rest of the Chinese smartphone market, citing Chinese government data. However, he warned that due to the shutdown of retail stores and a ""gradual and uncertain pace of normalcy"" that February shipments could worse than expected.",finance

Currently, Apple laptops and desktops use Intel processors, while the company's iPhones and iPads use Apple-designed processors using ARM technology. The first Mac with an ARM processor could enable Apple to more closely control the Mac release schedule and deliver improvements, such as improved battery life. But it may face challenges ensuring that the apps that run on Mac computers will also run on the new models, since the processors are different. Kuo believes that Apple's processor will use a 5 nanometer or ""5nm"" process for the chips in many of its upcoming products. 5nm is a measure of how small, dense, and advanced the chips can be manufactured. He said the 5G iPhone and new iPads planned for 2020 will also use the new 5nm chips. ""We expect that Apple's new products in 12“18 months will adopt processors made by 5nm process, including the new 2H20 5G iPhone, new 2H20 iPad equipped with mini LED, and new 1H21 Mac equipped with the own-design processor,"" Kuo wrote. Kuo's research at TF Securities focuses on Apple's supply chain and the companies it contracts with to make computer parts, and he has a reputation for accurately predicting Apple products before they are announced. Kuo said the deadly COVID-19 virus, which is disrupting electronics manufacturing, will not have any impact on Apple's roadmap for 5nm chips, which he says Apple has increased investment in. The coronavirus may hurt Apple's competitors' development processes more, Kuo said, because Apple will use more resources from companies like chip foundries.",finance
Kim Lyons,2/24/2020,theverge,China reportedly using WeChat and Twitter to find and silence people sharing coronavirus information,https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151404/china-wechat-twitter-coronavirus-critics-protest-information-share,"The Chinese government is tracking down people on social platforms like Twitter and WeChat who share what officials consider to be negative information about the coronavirus outbreak, Vice reports. The regulation of protest and dissent is not new in China, but people who have shared information about the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan describe relatively tame social media interactions that nonetheless resulted in both direct and indirect responses from the Chinese government, according to Vice. The coronavirus has become a subject of dissent in China, with online protests like the one following the death of whistleblower Li Wenliang racking up angry reactions that are then swiftly taken down. The hashtag I want freedom of speech spread on Chinese social media site Weibo in the hours after Li's death, racking up 2 million posts that were removed by the following day, NPR reported. But Vice says the crackdowns are starting to focus on individual and sometimes totally benign posts rather than just larger mass movements. A Chinese man vacationing in California told Vice that he was trying to share information about the coronavirus with family in Wuhan on WeChat. He says he believes the Chinese government pushed friends in China to ask about his whereabouts in the US and received a warning that someone in Shanghai was trying to access his WeChat account. Another man based in China said that officials visited him at his home in Dongguan after he responded to a tweet that was critical of how the Chinese government handled the spread of the virus. The officials told him his tweet was an attack on the Chinese government. His phone was confiscated, and he was forced to sign a statement saying he would not repeat the so-called threat, Vice reports. Related More than 2,600 people have died after contracting the new coronavirus, and it's sickened more than 79,000 people since it was first detected in Wuhan in December. The Chinese government has been harshly criticized for its mishandling of the outbreak, which has included censoring news reports about the situation in Wuhan and taking down Wuhan residents' social media posts, many of which reportedly described dire conditions. China also has cracked down on the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). Many people in China use VPNs to try to evade government censors online. The government has even instructed health workers not to mention the coronavirus in group chats, Vice reports.    ",tech
"Laurence Frost, Alistair Smout",2/24/2020,reuters,Airlines plunge as Italian coronavirus outbreak threatens longer crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-airlines/airlines-plunge-as-italian-coronavirus-outbreak-threatens-longer-crisis-idUSKCN20I234,"European budget airlines bore the brunt of Monday's plunge in global stock markets as the arrival of the coronavirus in Italy pointed to a longer, deeper crisis than many have banked on. EasyJet (EZJ.L) dropped 16.4% and Ryanair (RYA.I) 13.5% as airlines were forced to reassess the fallout from the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus across Asia and beyond, with South Korea, Italy and Iran now struggling to contain outbreaks. Although airlines have yet to suspend any Italian flights, the new outbreaks raised the specter of serious upheaval extending into the lucrative summer tourism season on a day when European stocks suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016. Concerns are growing that COVID-19 continues to spread and will impact demand to and from other European countries, Credit Suisse analysts said. Ireland, meanwhile, advised citizens to avoid some destinations in Italy, a major leisure market. While budget airlines are most exposed to Italy, Credit Suisse added that lower-margin legacy carriers are at risk from a broader traffic slump if the contagion unnerves consumers. In an email to frequent flyers on Monday, Singapore Airlines highlighted the air filtration systems on its jets as well as enhanced cleaning procedures between flights, including disinfectant fogging and removal of headrest covers. Among full-service European carriers, shares in Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA), Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) all fell about 9%. The market reaction is a reflection of the fear and uncertainty of the virus being in Europe and particularly in Italy, said Stephen Furlong, transport analyst at Dublin-based brokerage Davy. Air France-KLM last week said the virus would wipe 150 million to 200 million euros ($163 million to $217 million) off its earnings, assuming that flights suspended in January resume in April - a scenario that now looks increasingly optimistic. On the same day, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicted that the impact would echo that of the 2003 SARS virus outbreak, with an estimated $28 billion hit this time. It could well be significantly more than that, given the news over the weekend of cases in Iran and Italy, Phil Seymour, chief executive of aviation consultancy IBA, said on Monday. Some carriers that have suspended China services are likely to add capacity on other routes in the hope that they will benefit from displaced Asia leisure traffic, Seymour said. Carriers including Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) have already begun to reassign larger planes to transatlantic flights and Air France-KLM said it was considering redeployment options. But there are inherent dangers, Seymour warned. If you increase capacity too much because you've overestimated that demand shift, you just create a price war, he said. The crisis could ultimately force more bankruptcies among weaker carriers, which would benefit a fragmented European sector in need of consolidation, Davy's Furlong said. In the nearer term, however, it has darkened the industry's profit outlook just when market fundamentals had appeared to be improving. It looked like supply was going to be behind demand heading into this summer, Furlong said. This could rebalance that. Reporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by David Goodman",business

American Airlines shares dropped 8.5% to $25.45, a more than four-month low. Delta Air Lines' stock lost 6.3% to end at $54.23, lowest price in nearly four months, while United Airlines ended off 3.3% and Southwest Airlines fell 4.3%. The S&P 500 ended the day 3.4% lower. Close to 80,000 cases of the virus, now known as COVID-19, have been reported along with at least 2,621 deaths. Cases outside of China, where most of the infections are located, have increased, with Italy reporting more than 220 and South Korea confirming more than 830. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned citizens not to travel to affected areas, helping drive down shares of European carriers. Budget airline easyJet lost nearly 16.7% while rival Ryanair fell 13.5%. Deutsche Lufthansa fell 8.8%, British Airways' parent, International Consolidated Airlines Group, fell more than 9% and Air France-KLM lost 8.7%. More than 200,000 flights to, from and within China have already been canceled because of the virus, according to aviation consulting firm Cirium, and more disruptions are possible if the virus continues to spread. The coronavirus is expected to eat into carriers' revenue this year. Air travel demand globally is set to fall for the first time since 2009 and cost airlines some $29 billion ” mostly in the Asia-Pacific region ” in revenue, the International Air Transport Association warned last week. All U.S. carriers have already suspended service to mainland China and Hong Kong because of the outbreak of COVID-19. New cases in South Korea, Iran and Italy have added to concerns about the rapid spread of the virus, as airlines look ahead to the busy travel periods in the second and third quarters. ",finance

However, one rumoured super-spreader has recently provided a spark for the disease in Italy which has since ignited more than 200 cases in the country's northernmost regions.  Italy's coronavirus cases have taken hold in the north of the country, around the northern border regions. While the number of cases has alarmed both authorities and the general public alike, the Italian government has taken care to prevent further spread. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises people staying in the country should follow local instructions.

The government in Rome has locked down towns, shut schools and banned gatherings in the wealthy north “ including the financial capital of Milan - to stem a surge of coronavirus infections. That risks hurting growth in Europe's industrial core. It's also an experiment in how far democratic economies can push draconian measures. With more than 200 confirmed cases as of Monday, and four deaths, Italy has become the European country most affected by the potentially lethal Covid-19 disease. That's a tiny fraction of the nearly 77,000 cases reported in China, the epicentre of the crisis. Yet the rapid rise in infections has rightly prompted Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government to introduce sweeping measures. Italy is no stranger to health emergencies. Severe epidemics are embedded in its rich culture. Alessandro Manzoni's novel The Betrothed depicts the outbreak of plague in Milan in the 17th century and the cruel manhunt for the source of the disease. The racy storytellers of Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron hide in a villa outside Florence to escape a 1348 outbreak of the same disease. Yet the latest crisis comes at a difficult moment. The euro zone's third-largest economy contracted in the final quarter of 2019, and the government expects GDP to grow a meagre 0.6% this year. Though the strict quarantine affects around 50,000 people, a one-week ban on public activities including concerts at La Scala of Milan and Venice's Carnival affects tens of millions. The northern region of Lombardy alone generates around a fifth of national output and nearly a third of exports. The 4% drop in Italian stocks on Monday morning reflects fears of a severe slowdown. Unlike China, which has imposed unprecedented restrictions, Italy operates within the limits of its democratic system. The measures approved by decree at the weekend must be confirmed by parliament. The risk is that policies which impinge on personal liberties and hurt businesses and consumers trigger a backlash against Conte's already frail government. An extended outbreak could also test the free movement of people and goods to bordering European countries. That makes Italy a petri dish for fighting viruses in western democracies.

Lizzy Gurdus@lizzygurdus,2/24/2020,cnbc,Coronavirus fears take over for record rally 'FOMO',https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/coronavirus-fears-take-over-for-record-rally-fomo.html,"Step aside, FOMO. There's a new market-moving force on Wall Street that's trumping investors' ""fear of missing out"" on the record rally, one that left the major averages in the red on Friday with their first weekly losses in nearly a month, says Craig Johnson, senior technical research analyst at Piper Sandler. Until recently, even with the coronavirus outbreak stoking fear with global investors, ""We've been seeing equities rallying and some stocks going parabolic out there,"" Johnson said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""But with the recent sell-off we're seeing, now it looks like a market that's going into 'FOCO,' which is the fear of the corona[virus] outbreak,"" he said. Johnson pointed to a chart comparing the S&P 500's performance in the last two years with that of the Cboe Volatility Index, more commonly referred to as the VIX or the stock market's ""fear gauge."" When the VIX begins to break above its 200-day moving average ” identified in purple on the chart below  ” it tends to indicate that investors are ""going into a bit of a risk-off mode,"" the analyst said. The S&P's weakness during those times seems to reflect that as well.  ""That's exactly what we're seeing right now,"" Johnson said. ""Couple that together with our longer-term measures of market breadth that ... issued a sell signal just a few weeks ago, and this is a market that's setting up, perhaps, to be using the coronavirus fears as a reason to be taking some profits in here, at least short term."" On Friday, the key level Johnson was watching in the S&P was 3,720, roughly the level of the index's 50-day moving average. He saw that level as a floor of support, adding ""we would buy the dip"" if the S&P were to fall that far. The S&P ended trading down more than 1% on Friday, at 3,337.75. Steve Chiavarone, an equity strategist, portfolio manager and vice president at Federated Hermes, said that while he didn't want to diminish the seriousness of the lives lost to the coronavirus, he didn't see the market impact lasting very long. ""From an economic perspective, our view is that viruses, natural disasters, government shutdowns, Boeing shutdowns, for that matter, ... represent demand deferred, not demand destroyed, meaning that if corona disrupts the supply chain around the iPhone and the iPhone doesn't come out in September, but it comes out in December, people are not going to not buy it. They're just going to buy it later,"" Chiavarone said in the same ""Trading Nation"" interview. Earnings and economic growth may be dented in the short term, he said, but he doesn't expect the coronavirus to be the story of the market in 2020. ""We think what you're dealing with is going to be a first half that's going to be on the weaker side from corona[virus], from Boeing, but we think that the second half is going to be a kind of V-shaped recovery,"" the strategist said. With the U.S. consumer strong, interest rates low and the Federal Reserve's 2019 stimulus ""filtering through"" the U.S. economy, the underlying growth drivers are still in place to sustain a second-half recovery, Chiavarone said. ""What we would suggest for investors is when you look at parts of the market ” particularly the cyclicals ” where you've really got names that are getting beat up because maybe they're tied to tourism or trade or supply chains, start to bargain hunt,"" he said. ""Start to look for opportunities there because we think once the economy rebounds in the second half, those names are going to rebound pretty strongly."" While Johnson maintained that, for tactical investors, ""it's time to take some profits"" in the near term, he agreed with Chiavarone on the long-term outlook. ""We still have a 3,600 year-end price objective"" for the S&P, he said. ""But, in the near term, ... whether this is a V-shaped bottom or a U-shaped bottom here for the coronavirus, it's going to be a little [un]settling for investors until they understand where those earnings estimates go.""

Stocks fell sharply Monday as the number of coronavirus cases outside of China surged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding more than 1,000 points intraday and erasing its year-to-date gain. But as investors fretted over the outbreak's potential impact on the global economy, market commentators largely agreed that this drop, however vicious, was warranted after months of a seemingly unstoppable rally. Here's what three of them said Monday about the plunge: Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of CalSTRS, advised investors to think long term: ""We're going to sit back. The market is finally reacting to the risk of the virus, something that I was surprised [didn't happen] last week when we hit record highs. We don't even know the full measure of it yet, obviously. The fact that cases are dropping in China is a good sign, but when they open up their economy and people travel, that's going to probably increase the number of cases. So, you've got to think long term and you've got to back away from a day like today and not just react. Don't think in 91-day increments, but think more in decades like Warren Buffett does."" Kevin Caron, co-founder and senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, said the global economic backdrop still looked relatively strong: ""There's a lot of good things going on beyond the immediate news, [including] the improvement in tone in terms of the overall global economy. There was a lot of pump-priming from central banks over the last year or so. There has been a drawdown in inventories around the world and that could lead to a more sustained pickup this year. Unfortunately, right at the moment where you would be looking for that pickup to start to get some real lift, we've been hit with this coronavirus, which does have some real impacts. There are very significant supply chains in China, and when you look at the IHS Markit Services survey from last week, it was a very large drop here in the United States. So, we're weighing the bigger picture, which is one that is, we think, going to move towards an improved economy later this year, but we have the near-term challenge and uncertainties surrounding coronavirus and the spread of that virus, which has significant impacts, as we see today, in the near term."" Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory: ""We've gone over six months without a normal correction. You layer on the coronavirus, which provides more uncertainty, and we think the risk-reward near term remains mixed on it. So, from our perspective, what does that mean? That means maybe bringing equity allocations that have run up quite a bit back to targets, maybe a little bit of cash. In some of our more tactical portfolios late last year we added a little bit of gold. I just want to say, longer term, we still think the bull market trend is intact, but when you shut down the second-largest economy in the world, that's going to have some impact.""

Lora Kolodny@lorakolodny,2/24/2020,cnbc,Tesla shares tumble on coronavirus fears driving broad market sell-off,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/tesla-shares-tumble-on-coronavirus-fears-driving-broad-market-sell-off.html,"Tesla shares tumbled on Monday amid a broader market sell-off driven by investors' coronavirus concerns. The COVID-19 epidemic in China could turn into a pandemic, with infections on the rise in Iran, Italy and South Korea. Tesla, which recently began manufacturing operations in Shanghai, saw its shares close down 7.5%, ending the day at $833.79. Tesla also relies on many Chinese suppliers to make its electric cars, and is hoping to sell more cars to Chinese consumers. By way of comparison, the S&P 500 lost 3.35%, and most large-cap tech stocks with limited exposure to China dropped around 4%. As the outbreak emerged, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said on a 2019 fourth-quarter earnings call that the coronavirus outbreak would only cause the business a week-and-a-half production delay in China. By Feburary 13, 2020, the company changed its tone and said in an annual financial filing that the coronavirus outbreak may have a material adverse impact on its business. Tesla Investors have also been concerned about the final results of an Autopilot-related crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB plans to deliver that report on Tuesday afternoon in Washington D.C. (It originally planned to reveal its findings in the morning, but postponed the report.) Tesla CEO Elon Musk frequently claims that Autopilot saves lives. However, the safety of this automated driver assistance system, which is standard in newer Tesla vehicles, is still being evaluated by third party researchers. The NTSB previously recommended that all automakers with automated driver assist systems on the market -- including Tesla Autopilot, Cadillac Super Cruise, Nissan ProPilot or Volvo Pilot Assist-- implement changes to keep drivers attentive while using them, and to prevent abuse or mis-use of the technology. Tesla drivers often boast online about using Autopilot features such as Autosteer to drive without touching the steering wheel, and others fall asleep behind the wheel. They do this, even though the fine print of Tesla's vehicle owners manual cautions drivers: ""Autosteer is a BETA feature,"" and ""Warning: Autosteer is a hands-on feature. You must keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times."" Tesla's own marketing videos previously depicted drivers with their hands off the wheel.",finance

And if that decline goes past 1,000 points, it could be the biggest one-day drop since 2018. If you're like many investors, you may be inclined to check your investment balances, including your 401(k), in reaction to the news. Yet reacting to a sudden market fall is exactly what you shouldn't do, according to one expert. ""Volatility is inherently frightening,"" said Dan Ariely, professor of behavioral economics at Duke University and chief behavioral economist at personal finance app Qapital. ""Being frightened means that we are paralyzed, we think about it too much."" ""It influences our well-being, and it doesn't necessarily lead to good decisions,"" he added. In 2008, when the markets were going crazy, Ariely found himself checking his own accounts more frequently as everything changed every half hour. On a Friday morning, before a weekend away with his wife, he found himself consumed with checking his investments. And the compulsion put him in a bad mood. ""I wasn't going to sell,"" he said. ""I wasn't going to buy; I was just kind of looking obsessively. ""It was about noon when I realized I was out of control,"" Ariely said. ""I was looking too much."" Consequently, Ariely decided to enter his password wrong three times and lock himself out of his account. ""I couldn't check anymore, and the weekend was much nicer,"" Ariely said. What's more, Ariely took his time before fixing his account so that he could check it again. ""If we're going to look at it going up and down, we're just going to be more miserable,"" Ariely said. ""We're not only going to be more miserable, but act on it."" Those moves often include fleeing from stocks to bonds or cash ” investments with a higher expected value for those with a lower expected value. ""Historically, those are some of the biggest mistakes that people can make,"" he said. Checking numbers, too, often can make it more difficult to accurately interpret trends, according to Ariely. Take weight loss, for example. If people look at their weight in precise measurements with decimals ” say 162.3 pounds ” they tend to create stories to make sense of what they are seeing. And the result is often that they become unmotivated, Ariely said. If instead people look at their weight data in a less granular way, say how it trends over several weeks, they can more accurately see what is happening. Plus, they tend to get less anxious and take better care of their health, he said.

Lou Whiteman,2/24/2020,fool,Why Shares of Southwest Airline Are Falling Today,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/24/why-shares-of-southwest-airline-are-falling-today.aspx,"Shares of domestic-focused Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) so far in 2020 had held up better than shares of the company's more international-dependent rivals, with the stock up more than 5% for the year heading into this week's trading compared to the NYSE Arca Airline Index's 5% decline. That all changed on Monday as Southwest shares fell 5% on word the coronavirus is expanding rapidly around the globe. Southwest shares joined in a broader market sell-off after reports of widespread coronavirus cases in Italy and South Korea. Airline stocks are a logical target for investors looking to reduce risk, and indeed airline shares were hard hit in January as the coronavirus outbreak originally worsened. But the conventional wisdom then was the coronavirus was a problem mainly in China or, at most, Asia, and carriers like Southwest that only fly domestically and to the Caribbean were not caught up in the initial sell-off. The virus's aggressive spread is making investors question that initial assumption and reconsider the potential impact on Southwest and other U.S.-focused travel businesses. Even if the U.S. averts a widespread outbreak, the renewed focus on the virus is coming just as U.S. travelers are in the process of planning summer vacations. It's at least possible that concerns about the virus will suppress U.S. travel demand during the key summer holiday season and impact the results of Southwest and other airlines. The market hates uncertainty, so it's no surprise to see shares of Southwest selling off today. Southwest has other challenges on its plate right now, most notably its reliance on Boeing's troubled 737 aircraft, so it might make sense for those with a low risk tolerance to watch from the sidelines. But for a long-term holder with the stomach to ride through turbulence, Southwest is just as good an investment today as it was a month ago. There is likely to be continued volatility as this situation plays out, but Southwest has the wherewithal to power through these headwinds.",business
"Luke McGee, Sharon Braithwaite and Paul P. Murphy, CNN",2/24/2020,cnn,"As coronavirus cases rise in Italy's north, people warned not to panic-buy ",https://cnn.com/2020/02/24/europe/italy-coronavirus-outbreak-monday-intl/index.html," Italy was racing Monday to contain the first major outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus in Europe, prompting fears that the international community is losing the battle to prevent the virus from becoming a full-scale pandemic. Is it safe for travelers to visit Italy? The epicenter of the outbreak is in northern Italy, where at least 7 people have died and the number of confirmed cases jumped from three on Friday morning to at least 229 by Monday evening. Authorities announced sweeping restrictions over the weekend for parts of the regions of Lombardy and Veneto. The restrictions affect about 100,000 people, the civil protection agency estimated on Monday. While most of the cases have been reported in the two regions, there were additional cases in Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Lazio. A team of health experts from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control arrived in Italy on Monday, to assist local authoritie s. Read More Tourist attractions have been closed, private meetings have been banned and schools have been shut. People inside these areas are being asked to stay inside and avoid contact with others. The measures also include transport restrictions in some places and the surveillance and quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus, according to Italy's health minister. The WHO said it was concerned over what it called the ""rapid"" increase in reported cases in Italy. ""However, it should also be noted that based on current data, in the majority of cases (4 out of every 5) people experience mild or no symptoms,"" the organization said in a statement. Stranded lobsters and missing wedding dresses: The coronavirus is a daily reminder of China's global reach While European officials are still urging for calm and Italian authorities believe that the spread has been contained, the fact that an outbreak of this scale has happened in a European Union member state will spark fears of wider contagion, given the EU's Schengen Area, which allows people in most EU member states to move between countries without border checks. The majority of the deaths and cases are in Lombardy, not far from Milan, the region's capital and world-famous tourist hotspot. The city was far quieter than usual on Monday morning, with even its famous Gothic cathedral closed to tourists. And even in this major financial capital, the news of the outbreak appeared to trigger a run on some supermarkets. People wearing respiratory masks wait to get into a supermarket in Casalpusterlengo, southeast of Milan, on Sunday. Beppe Sala, Milan's mayor, said that ""rather than dashing to the supermarkets to grab food, perhaps we should spend time looking after the most vulnerable, such as old people, who are particularly at risk."" Petra Dalla Tor, a resident of Milan, told CNN that while some shelves were empty at her supermarket, she was able to stock up on enough supplies to tide her over. ""[I've] never seen it before, but I must say that the rest of the supermarket was okay, the empty shelves were only regarding pasta, biscuits, and canned goods. No problem with fresh fruits and vegetables,"" she said. ""I don't really understand how serious the situation is, so I just wanted to buy something and be prepared for the week,"" she added. ""Masks are unavailable in all the pharmacies and via Amazon it will take a couple of weeks to have them ... people bought all of them and pharmacies run out of stock, I guess. Same with hand sanitizer."" A half-empty supermarket shelf in Milan. Viktoria Bozukova, a Milan resident, told CNN she had looked for masks in eight shops on Sunday and three on Monday but that all were sold out. ""There are no masks and they don't know when they are going to have [them],"" she said. Attilio Fontana, Lombardy's president, has urged residents to stay calm and stop panic-buying, saying ""rushing to stock up on food doesn't make any sense. There are enough supplies."" Matteo Marconi, who lives in the small municipality of Castiglione d'Adda, said he had not experienced the same level of supermarket runs reported in Milan. ""The only real queue was at the pharmacy where a civil protection officer regulates the entrances ... for now it feels like a long weekend, but eventually I think it will start to feel like a situation of constraint,"" he told CNN. ""We live by the day. There are very few people around and they wear masks ... We live near the countryside so we can go outside and walk around, but we limit contact with others as much as possible."" A sign indicating that facemasks are sold out in one pharmacy in Venice on Monday. Meanwhile in Venice -- capital of Veneto -- the situation is complicated by the fact that the city is in the middle of its annual carnival, one of the largest tourist events in the Venetian calendar. Before it was canceled, it was due to run until Tuesday, which meant an increased number of visitors, putting greater strain on local authorities. Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, confirmed on Sunday that there had been several dozen cases in the region, including two in the city of Venice. He said that private and public meetings were banned until March 1. The people of Venice are letting their frustrations be known. Roberto, who works at a bar in St. Mark's Square, said, ""Why are they here? Why aren't we blocking them,"" while pointing to a group of Chinese tourists. ""This could have been avoided if we closed the ports, blocked all flights coming from China, Korea, Japan."" People wearing protective masks in Venice on Sunday. While countries like Germany, Switzerland and Austria are not imposing travel restrictions on people coming from Italy just yet, fears will remain over Europe's ability to contain a crisis like this. The combination of the continent's relatively open borders and a highly infectious virus that experts say can spread without a carrier showing any sign of symptoms means that the potential is there for the situation to worsen in a hurry. As Stella Kyriakides, the European commissioner for health, tweeted on Sunday : ""Viruses know no borders, it is only through global cooperation and coordination that we will be able to contain the spread of #COVID19.""

Mark DeCambre,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Why the coronavirus outbreak is delivering a fresh dose of recession fear to stock-market investors,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-coronavirus-outbreak-is-delivering-a-fresh-dose-of-recession-fear-to-the-stock-market-2020-02-22?mod=article_inline,"The old saw used to be that when the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. Now, a more apropos adage for market bears may be that when an outbreak of coronavirus grinds the world's second-largest economy to a halt, the rest of the world catches a recession. Indeed, recession fears resurfaced on Wall Street last week, even as equity markets stood not far from all-time highs, amid volatile trade that whipsawed mostly on jitters that supply chains and economies could suffer from the spread of the infectious illness that originated in Wuhan, China, known as COVID-19. The [coronavirus spread] definitely injects an element of uncertainty into markets for the near term and for the longer term as well, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. Stocks sold off sharply Monday to add to last week's decline, with the Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -1.79% down 779 points, or 2.7%, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.32% dropped 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.57% shed 2.9%. Analysts at BofA Global Research said the probabilities of a recession have increased and that is reflected in the action in yields for the 10-year Treasury note and the 30-year Treasury bond, which plunged Friday to its lowest rate on record. Investors will flee to the presumed safety of U.S. government bonds, driving yields lower, with the hope of avoiding losses that can derail riskier assets in a selloff. Read: Gold, Treasury prices soar as coronavirus fears spark global stock-market selloff and flight to safety The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.417% fell a further 9 basis points Monday into uncharted territory at 1.826%. The 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.674% , which last week tumbled below the key level of 1.5%, wa down 10 basis points at 1.371%. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices. BofA said a move for the 10-year below 1.4% could represent a tipping point for the market, one that raises the probability for a recession, particularly if the Federal Reserve continues to hold benchmark rates at the current 1.50-1.75% range. Here's how BofA's analysts put it (see attached chart): Indeed, breaking 1.4% in an on-hold context for the Fed creates a significant inversion of the curve, pushes recession signals higher¦ Source: BofA Global Research Part of the worry for fixed-income folks is the flattening of the yield curve, which traces yields across maturities from short-dated to longer term. Once flat, there is a greater potential for the curve to invert, leaving short-end debt paying out more than longer-dated obligations. Inversions are seen as a reliable indicator of an economic downturn or recession. And one key measure of that, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year T-note yield, stood at less than 10 basis points on Monday. Already, the 3-month T-bill yield TMUBMUSD03M, 0.178% at 1.505% trades above the 10-year rate. Read : 5 things investors need to know about an inverted yield curve For some, the reading of services activity from IHS Markit released on Friday also elevated recession concerns , which fell 4 points to 49.4. Any number over 50 signifies expansion; below 50 points to contraction. Tom McClellan, a prominent technical analyst , said the yield curve inversion that occurred in the summer of last year is still in force and that market participants have been too dismissive of that recession signal (see attached chart): Generally speaking, it takes about 15 months for those effects to show up in overall economic data, he wrote in a Thursday research note. Recession signals Last year's yield curve inversion is still yet to be felt, and that is not even factoring the additional economic slowdown effect from the coronavirus, McClellan wrote. Amid all this recession talk, Gold US:GCJ20 has been on a tear. The precious metal often draws heavy bids during market uncertainty. On Monday, it extended gains, rising 1.7% to $1,676.50 an ounce after last week finishing at its highest level since 2013. Investors couldn't stop talking about the shiny yellow metal, even through it's unclear if those bets will pay out over a longer term. Even so, the Fed doesn't yet seem inclined to lower rates to placate nervous investors. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank is unlikely to lower interest rates given the positive economic outlook. On CNBC on Friday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard appeared to be sanguine about the health of the U.S. economy, even as they watched coronavirus closely. BMO's Ma said that those takes may be justified because the health of the domestic economy doesn't appear to be one genuinely signaling that a recession is afoot. Corporate earnings for one have been mostly solid. Q4 results came in better than expected, rising 1.6% versus the expected 2.1% decline, representing the 32nd consecutive quarter in which actuals beat end-of-quarter estimates, said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. However, he said the outlook was softening, noting that 2020 forecasts are now at 5.9% versus the 7.9% at the start of the year.",business

There are now 79,407 cases of COVID-19 in 32 countries and 2,622 deaths, according to the most recent reports . However, gauged by the market's performance during the onset of other infectious diseases, including SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola and avian flu, Wall Street investors may have little to fear that the pathogen will sicken a U.S. stock market that finished 2019 with the best annual return in years and finished Thursday trade at all-time highs. That said, many investors are recommending caution amid the current bout of coronavirus that was reportedly first identified late last year in Wuhan City, China. The ability of the virus to halt travel and harm consumption, particularly in Beijing, are some of the ways an outbreak is likely to have economic implications that could wash up on U.S. shores. Risk velocity “ the pace at which major risks and black swan' events can affect asset prices “ is elevated in today's markets compared to 10 years ago for three key reasons, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, in a research note, referring to the theory for the impact of unexpected events on markets and economies, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable . The strategist said a social-media driven news cycle, the interconnectedness of global supply chains and a pricey stock market, make Wall Street more vulnerable to a black swan. External shocks can derail economic trends and abruptly alter market sentiment. Not all risk is economic policy or monetary, wrote David Kotok, chairman and CIO at money manager Cumberland Advisors, in a recent research note. On Thursday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.10% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.69% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.10% all had been trading near records up until Monday. However, investors have been attuned to updates on the spread of the disease. Historically, however, Wall Street's reaction to such epidemics and fast-moving diseases is often short-lived. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the S&P 500 posted a gain of 14.59% after the first occurrence of SARS back in 2002-03, based on the end of month performance for the index in April, 2003. About 12 months after that point, the broad-market benchmark was up 20.76% (see attached table): Epidemic Month end 6-month % change of S&P 12-month % change of S&P HIV/AIDS June 1981 -0.3 -16.5 Pneumonic plague September 1994 8.2 26.3 SARS April 2003 14.59 20.76 Avian flu June 2006 11.66 18.36 Dengue Fever September 2006 6.36 14.29 Swine flu April 2009 18.72 35.96 Cholera November 2010 13.95 5.63 MERS May 2013 10.74 17.96 Ebola March 2014 5.34 10.44 Measles/Rubeola December 2014 0.20 -0.73 Zika January 2016 12.03 17.45 Measles/Rubeola June 2019 9.82% N/A ” Source : Dow Jones Market Data SARS resulted in a total of about 8,100 people being sickened during the 2003 outbreak, with 774 people dying, according to data from WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Separately, the S&P 500 rose 11.66% in the roughly six months following reports of the 2006 Avian flu virus ” a fast-moving pathogen also known as H5N1. The market gained 18.36% in the following 12-month period. Data are similar for equity performance across the globe based on data from Charles Schwab, tracking the MSCI All Countries World Index 892400, . The index has gained an average 0.4% in the month after an epidemic, 3.1% in the ensuing six-month period and 8.5% a year later (see graphic below): The severity of the virus, ultimately, will dictate the market's reaction and just because indexes had managed to shrug off the contagion from outbreaks in the past doesn't mean that will be the case this time. For one, coronavirus occurred during the important Lunar New Year, when Asia tends to see peak travel and consumer spending. There are concerns that the coronavirus may spread quickly within and beyond China, causing economic and market damage. This is particularly a concern as travel ahead of the Lunar New Year is getting underway, wrote Jeffrey Kleintop, Charles Schwab's chief global investment strategist. The Wall Street Journal reported that the incubation period for the virus is around 14 days, citing health officials. People are most likely not contagious before symptoms develop. A pandemic couldn't come at a worse time for China's sluggish economy, which slowed to 6.1% rate of annual growth last year, according to gross domestic product figures released last Friday, which reflected the lowest reading for Beijing in nearly three decades.

Equity markets react unpredictably to the unknown; nevertheless, such events should not be examined in isolation, but viewed in common with other prevailing market conditions, according to a 2006 report commissioned by Fidelity Investments and cited by Bloomberg News . Indeed, potential disruptions to China's economy and factories could be significant because the country's share of the world economy by some measures has climbed to 19.3% in 2019, according to data from the International Monetary Fund (see attached chart).

Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, went on to say during a Beijing briefing that remdesivir seems to be the ""one drug right now that we think may have efficacy."" Shares of Gilead shot up by as much as 6.9% following the briefing. Remdesivir was originally developed to be an Ebola vaccine, but it proved less effective than was hoped against that disease. However, back in January, one COVID-19 patient who received remdesivir on a compassionate use basis saw a substantial improvement in symptoms. Since then, the Chinese government has started human trials with remdesivir, with WHO stating that clinical results would be available within weeks. Although the COVID-19 epidemic is becoming a major worldwide issue, developing a treatment for it might not be all that lucrative. Geoff Meacham, an analyst at Bank of America, has said that remdesivir as a coronavirus treatment would have little long-term impact to Gilead's bottom line, at best bringing in $2.5 billion in one-time revenue for the biotech giant.

"Matias Grez, CNN",2/24/2020,cnn,Neymar sees red in Paris Saint-Germain's thrilling comeback win against Bordeaux,http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/football/neymar-red-card-psg-bordeaux-ligue-1-spt-intl/index.html," Paris Saint-Germain bounced back from the disappointment of its Champions League defeat by Borussia Dortmund with victory over Bordeaux -- but it was far from straightforward. The two teams shared seven goals in one of the most thrilling games of the Ligue 1 season, as PSG came from a goal behind to secure a 4-3 win and extend its lead at the top of the table to 13 points. But the game ended on something of a sour note with Neymar shown a red card for a second bookable offense after clumsily hacking down Yacine Adli. The Brazilian appeared to have been left aggrieved after referee Willy Delajod declined to award him a number of free kicks; Neymar left the pitch sarcastically applauding the official and tore his shirt off in frustration. Though the victory will come as a relief to PSG, there will be some concern for coach Thomas Tuchel at the number of goals his team is conceding. Read More As well as the two conceded midweek against Dortmund, PSG shipped another four in last weekend's frenetic 4-4 draw against Ligue 1 struggler Amiens. READ: Neymar and Kylian Mbappe hailed as 'two of the best four players in the world' by PSG's Leonardo READ: Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi charged with criminal offenses in FIFA case Neymar received his second yellow card for a clumsy challenge on Yacine Adli. Cavani landmark To compound its defensive frailties, PSG lost captain and central defender Thiago Silva to a thigh injury after 25 minutes, which makes the Brazilian a doubt for the French Cup semifinal against Lyon and the Champions League second leg against Dortmund next month. There was some good news for PSG as striker Edinson Cavani scored a landmark 200th goal for the club since moving to the French capital in 2013, netting the equalizer after Hwang Ui-jo had opened the scoring for Bordeaux. Though he has struggled for fitness and game time this season, scoring only five goals, the Uruguayan is the club's all-time record goalscorer. After Marquinhos, who replaced the injured Silva as captain, had given PSG the lead once again, then arrived arguably the strangest goal of the weekend. Stand-in PSG goalkeeper Sergio Rico shanked his clearance straight into the shins of Bordeaux defender Pablo and the ball cannoned into the goal. Marquinhos once again came to PSG's rescue, scoring again to mark his first ever double for the club, before Kylian Mbappe got the fourth goal soon after. Edinson Cavani celebrates his 200th goal for PSG. Ruben Pardo's thunderbolt seven minutes from time set up a nervous finish for the Parisians but they held on for victory, despite going a man down in the dying stages. While there is no doubt PSG can be devastating going forward and possesses one of the most lethal attacking forces in Europe, any hope of winning a maiden Champions League title will be surely be over if Tuchel can't find a way to plug the leaks in defense. Message of solidarity For the match against Bordeaux, PSG replaced its regular shirt sponsor with the message ""Stay Strong China"" in English and Chinese to show support for the efforts in fighting the deadly coronavirus. PSG's official sponsor was replaced with a messge of solidarity for China. Since the outbreak at the end of 2019 -- which is believed to have come from a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province -- more than 2,600 people are confirmed to have died and more than 79,000 people have been infected. Before the match, banners in the middle of the pitch and in the team photo also showed the message of solidarity on a weekend that saw the coronavirus affect European football. A number of matches in Italy's Serie A were canceled as the government put emergency measures into place after a spike in cases in the country.",general

Michael Dezuanni,2/24/2020,theconversation,3 ways to help children think critically about the news,https://www.theconversation.com/3-ways-to-help-children-think-critically-about-the-news-131454,"Like adults, children use the news to learn about what's happening in the world. But the circulation of misinformation, such as the recent spread of fake news about COVID-19 (the disease caused by coronavirus), blurs our understanding of events and issues. In 2017, we conducted the first nationally representative survey of how Australian children, aged eight to 16, consume news. We found children as young as eight are interested in news. But there are few news media designed specifically for children in Australia.  The three national news programs for children are News Corporation's Kidsnews, an independent daily news podcast Squiz Kids and the ABC's longstanding Behind the News (BtN), which our research shows is popular with eight to 12 year olds.  Although children's news programs are important, safe and appealing, children are still exposed to other types of news. Our survey found 73% of children regularly consume the same news as their parents or guardians and 49% get news from social media sites, which increases with age. Our survey also found only one third of young people felt they could distinguish fake from real news. Here are three things you can do (whether you're a teacher or parent) to help children critically think about the news. In our research children considered a range of items “ from breakfast morning television segments to YouTube celebrity videos “ as news. To help decide if a source is reliable they can ask the following questions: is this a straight presentation of the facts or does it include opinion? A fact is objective information, supported by evidence, and it can be checked to ensure it is right. Opinions are subjective thoughts about an issue nobody can prove are right. If opinions are presented as facts this is misleading are the people essential to this story included? If a story makes claims about organisations or groups of people, they should be given the opportunity to reply to these claims. This series of materials from ABC Education can help children distinguish fact from fiction, including how to quickly identify fake videos and images. You may like to begin with their fun quiz, which highlights how complicated it can be to identify real news from misinformation (for children 12+). In our survey, 71% of young Australians said news often or sometimes upset them and 57% said it scared them. It's not all negative though, as 69% said news often or sometimes made them happy or hopeful and 48% said it motivated them to respond to the situation being reported.  Discussing how children feel about news can help them decide which programs are good for them and which they should avoid. While it's natural for news about major events and issues to evoke emotions, sometimes people can also seek to exploit our emotional responses for their benefit. Research shows catchy, provocative and sensationalist news headlines are more likely to receive clicks online. using sensationalist claims or headlines not supported by facts. These claims may say things like The wonder herb that stops coronavirus! or Coronavirus spreading fast on Sydney trains! using a shocking or altered image (such as one that suggests a celebrity might be pregnant or in a new relationship when she is not). to create clickbait, which is a sensationalist statement designed to encourage people to click on it. This can make money for a website's owner if they include advertising, since they will be paid based on how many people see and click an advertisement. In our survey, 38% of children said news does not treat people from different race and cultural backgrounds equally and 40% believed news does not treat men and women equally. Parents and teachers can help children be on the lookout for stories where some people are represented in a denigrating way that does not present their ideas fairly. In these cases it's best to seek out other news sources to consider how they are reporting the story. For instance, racist information has been presented as news in relation to coronavirus. Some sites claimed you could get it from eating Chinese food while others promoted the notion of it being a bioweapon made by China or the US.  This kind of misinformation contributes to discrimination. In Australia people of Chinese heritage have experienced racist attacks while many Australians have now stopped eating at Chinese restaurants.

Identifying misinformation in the digital age is a challenge for everyone.

The infection rate in China currently stands at around 77,000 while close to 2,600 lives have been claimed. Added to this, over 1,200 cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries and there have been over 20 deaths so far. n a note, Barclays analysts wrote: The market reaction to the coronavirus appears to be evolving, beginning to differentiate the currencies vulnerable to the virus from the rest.

In a letter sent to Global Affairs Canada on Saturday, 44 families said that poor communication and misinformation meant their relatives did not board either of the previous government-chartered flights. The families represent about 100 Canadian citizens and PRs who want to leave Wuhan. The families gave examples of language barriers, limited internet access and personal isolation as reasons why people did not board the flights, as well as general confusion about who was permitted to board the planes. We are pleading urgently with the government to have compassion to bring our families and loved ones home, the letter said. Over 500 Canadians have been evacuated due to the coronavirus since the crisis began, according to Global Affairs Canada. Two Canadian government-chartered flights have flown out of Wuhan, a government plane repatriated 129 Canadians from a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship docked in Japan, and a number of Canadians flew home on a United States government-chartered flight from Wuhan. China reported 77,150 cases of coronavirus on Monday, with a death count of 2,592. The majority of these are in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. The longer this ordeal carries on, and the longer the lockdown continues for these unfortunate individuals, the more danger it will impose on the Canadians stuck there, the letter read. Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters in Ottawa the government's attention was turning inward as the window closes in terms of stopping global spread, and it would have to be very thoughtful on how to proceed with any further repatriations.

American depositary shares of Chinese airlines declined, with China Southern Airlines Co. falling 5.2% to $27.82 and China Eastern Airlines Corp. falling 4.6% to $22.64. Stocks of cruise companies also took a hit. Cruises have drawn outsize attention for becoming incubators for the pathogen.

Though opportunities are likely to resurface after the epidemic resolves, the effect on leisure companies could be longer term, said Chris Gaffney, the president for world markets at TIAA Bank. The epidemic's expansion outside of China ""sent shivers into investors that this could grow into more of a pandemic,"" Mr. Gaffney told The Wall Street Journal. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Monday said the epidemic hasn't morphed into a pandemic, though it has the potential to. An epidemic generally refers to a disease that has spread over a large geographic area over a long period of time. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over many continents and countries, affecting large numbers of people.

With individual travel visas for visits by mainland China residents and group travel suspended, Macau's gross gaming revenue could plunge 90% in February and 80% in March, assuming no significant improvement in travel, according to Bernstein Research analyst Vitaly Umansky. Lauren Goodwin, an economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, said the asset manager is defensive on its portfolio as the epidemic remains a risk over the long-term unless infection cases diminish or the development of antiviral drugs materially progress.

The drop for oil accompanied a selloff in global equities and other assets perceived as risky, triggered by a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of China. The spread of disease caused by a coronavirus that emerged near Wuhan, China, late last year has sparked fears of a hit to supply chains and global economic activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 800 points , or 3%, as oil futures settled.

The precious metal is becoming a more widely desired currency again, Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer of GoldSeek.com, told MarketWatch. Volumes in it is rising and gold markets around the world will be trading it increasingly more so as one of the world's most liquid currencies. In the short term, gold is going to remain extremely volatile as the uncertainties around the current global economic impact from COVID-19 keeps the fear and uncertainties in gold's favor, he said. Read: Gold's rise to 7-year highs feeds talk of a climb to record prices of $2,000 and beyond However, there is a growing price premium with the gold price due to the virus”perhaps at $50 or more, Spina said.

On Saturday, the IMF said China's coronavirus epidemic will likely cut 0.1% from global economic growth and drag down China's economic growth to 5.6% this year. Worries about the disease's spread has driven the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.725% to 1.363% following a dip to $1.3513, its lowest since July 2016. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields. Lower rates can drive the appeal of gold because the precious commodity doesn't offer a coupon. Assets considered risky were taking a beating, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.64% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.36% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.14% down sharply on Monday after Asian and European markets fell for the session. Risk-off has taken hold of global markets as investors are growing incredibly concerned that the market could be on the verge of a massive meltdown as we are moving well past the weak Chinese recovery scenario, wrote Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, in a Monday research report. Italy has shut down schools, universities and museums across the country's north as the southern European country reported its fifth death from COVID-19, the disease caused by the strain of coronavirus that reportedly originated in Wuhan, China last year, and has claimed thousands of lives globally and sickened tens of thousands, The Wall Street Journal and others reported on Monday. The outbreak touching down in Europe comes as millions have been in lockdown in China due to the outbreak and fears that it could hurt the global economy. But since the virus was identified last year, it has rapidly spread to Japan, South Korea and other parts of the world. The U.S. Federal Reserve is more likely to be forced to cut interest rates to respond to economic growth concerns, partly driven by the spread of the coronavirus outside of China, according to economists at a top policy conference Monday .

The S&P 500 index lost 3.4%, erasing its 2020 gains and more. All 11 of its sectors declined, led by energy's 4.6% drop. A sharp rise in coronavirus cases and deaths outside of China had investors worried about the potential impact on global supply chains and consumer demand. But not every stock lost value as investors fled to haven assets like gold and U.S. government debt on Monday. Thirteen of the S&P 500's 505 components (some companies have multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's GOOGL and GOOG) managed to end up on the day. The 13 That Rose Source: FactSet Biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (ticker: REGN) was the top performer, closing up 5.5%. Bad news for a competitor was good news for Regeneron: 
        Novartis ' (NVS) Beovu macular-degeneration treatment had some concerning safety reports, suggesting that Regeneron's Eylea alternative could command a greater market share. Analysts upgraded Regeneron, sending its shares higher despite the coronavirus-spurred selloff. Fellow biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) rose 4.6%. It is developing a treatment for the new form of coronavirus that arose in central China last month”referred to as COVID-19. A World Health Organization official specifically singled out the potential for Gilead's Remdesivir treatment. The drug has shown to be effective against other forms of coronavirus in animals, and is currently in trials in China in COVID-19 patients. While stocks tumbled on Monday, gold hit its highest settlement price since early 2013. That pushed shares in gold miner Newmont (NEM) 1.7% higher. Investors sought the safety and stability of the metal. Some also sought to take down their risk exposure by buying defensive stocks in the consumer staples, health care, or utilities sectors. These companies' earnings tend to be relatively stable regardless of what the economy or the rest of the market does. After all, people still need to buy toothpaste, go to the doctor, and use electricity, even during a recession or a viral epidemic. True to form, a handful of consumer-goods companies rose, namely Clorox (CLX) (1.6%), Lamb Weston (0.5%) (LW), and Campbell Soup (0.1%) (CPB). Utility giant Dominion Energy (D) added 0.5%. Senior-housing real-estate investment trust Ventas (VTR) ticked 0.1% higher. A pair of operators of stock, bond, and options exchanges also emerged as beneficiaries of Monday's turmoil: MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), up 0.5%, and CME Group (CME), up 0.2%. The companies earn a commission whenever a bond or an options contract changes hands on one of its platforms, so whenever trading volatility increases, so do their revenues. Monday was the largest volume day of the year on U.S. exchanges. Public Storage (PSA) rose 0.3%, ahead of its earnings report on Tuesday. It had endured a big drop last week after the self storage company's competitor Extra Space Storage (EXR) gave poor profit guidance for 2020.

Nicole Wetsman,2/24/2020,theverge,Labs in the US will start looking for the new coronavirus this week,https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147157/coronavirus-lab-surveillance-flu-cdc-virus-tracking-testing,"Six public health labs in the US plan to start monitoring the general population for the new coronavirus this week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the risk of the virus still remains low for the general population. But activating the disease surveillance network will allow the CDC and other public health officials to find any undetected virus circulating through the country. It's important because right now, all the efforts are focused on people who have a direct link to China, or a direct link to lab-confirmed cases. There's no system in place to detect low-level transmission that might be under the radar, says Edward Belongia, the director of the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Population Health at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute. The six labs ” in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City ” are already part of the nationwide influenza surveillance network, and they conduct regular monitoring of all types of viruses. At the labs, samples from sick people are tested for various pathogens, creating a big-picture look at how much various diseases are spreading through the community. Surveillance hasn't started yet, in part because of problems with the test for the novel coronavirus developed by the CDC. The test that will be used for surveillance that was designed to diagnose people who have symptoms of the illness caused by the virus called COVID-19. It was distributed to public health labs around the country last week, but the majority of the labs had trouble running it. The CDC says this often happens during the rollout of a new test, but it has not specified what the reasons for the errors are. Once the tests are up and running, though, the existing system is well-equipped to start scanning for the new coronavirus, says Peter Shult. Shult is director of the Communicable Disease Division in the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, which is one of three National Influenza Reference Centers in the US. The whole concept of having something emerging and being able to deal with it with existing infrastructure is what we did with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, he says. We have more capacity now, and more experience dealing with a novel event. Efforts to track viruses circulating around the US mainly focus on the flu. Throughout the year, hundreds of public health labs test patients' respiratory samples to see if they're sick from the flu, and if so, what kind of influenza virus is causing their illness. After an initial layer of analysis, some samples are also sent on to one of the National Influenza Reference Centers or to the CDC directly so there can be more detailed information collected about them ” for example, the genetic sequence of the virus. Clinical labs at hospitals and other health care centers, which focus on diagnosing patients, also report data to the CDC. It all gives a very broad picture of influenza activity, Shult says. Another surveillance system called the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) overlaps with the influenza-monitoring programs. In many public health labs, any sample tested for influenza is then tested again for a range of viruses, including rotaviruses (which cause diarrhea) and a number of viruses that cause colds. The types and number of viruses screened for, though, vary state by state. Surveillance for the novel coronavirus will take advantage of all of these existing methods and platforms. According to the CDC, public health labs will be asked to test any sample that screens negative for influenza for the novel coronavirus. My take is that this is a way to rapidly stand up laboratories to really cast a broad net, Shult says. The labs probably won't be testing each sample by itself, though. Shult says he expects that they'll be told to mix multiple samples together to make it more efficient. Labs can do that because these samples aren't being tested to diagnose individual patients; they're only looking to see if the virus shows up in the population at all. Testing in batches is common in disease surveillance, and it's used regularly in HIV surveillance, for example. At the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, running new coronavirus tests wouldn't be particularly burdensome, Shult says. At smaller labs, though, with fewer resources, it might be more difficult, he says. They all have the capabilities to do it, but might not have the capacity. Once labs are able to run the tests and the novel coronavirus surveillance ramps up, the CDC will refine its methods. As we learn more, and if we start detecting the virus, we can make this a more effective and cost effective surveillance system. Or, if we test and finding nothing, it might mean there's nothing there, or that we're just not testing in the right areas, Shult says. It's something we'll have to struggle with for months to come. ",tech

""Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus, we are altering the production plan for our three week shoot in Venice, the scheduled first leg of an extensive production for Mission: Impossible 7,"" Paramount said in a statement Monday. ""During this hiatus we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts,"" the company added. ""We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves."" The Wrap was the first to report the news. As of Monday morning, more than 220 people had been infected in Italy with a majority of cases in the country's northern region of Lombardy and neighboring Veneto, where local authorities have shut down schools and gatherings in an effort to prevent the virus' spread. There are more than 79,000 confirmed cases and at least 2,621 deaths across the globa from the virus as of Monday. The movie, which is the seventh film in the franchise, was meant to shoot in Venice for three weeks, according to The Wrap. It is unclear if this delay will impact the release date for ""Mission: Impossible VII,"" which is currently set for July 23, 2021, or its budget. The previous film in the franchise ""Mission: Impossible ” Fallout"" cost around $180 million to make, not including its marketing spend. The ""Mission Impossible"" flick isn't the only movie production to be halted due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. In China all productions were told to cease shooting in the region, including the Donnie Yen-helmed ""Polar Rescue"" and at least 10 television shows. While some productions have since continued, since actors cannot wear masks during takes, shooting teams have been advised to remain small, limiting their crews to under 20 people when possible, according to a report from Variety. Additionally, Beijing's film bureau has said it will provide financial support to production companies and cinemas that have been hit hard by recent theater closures and production stoppages. It's unclear how or when that financial support will be doled out. Currently, cinemas across the country are shuttered and it's uncertain when they will be reopened. That could be bad news for American companies that are set to release massive blockbusters in the region in the coming months. Disney's ""Mulan"" has long been expected to perform tremendously well in China, but if theater closures continue that box office haul could take a hit. Disney has not said the movie's March release in China has been altered, but analysts are already bracing for the announcement. The biggest worry is that the film will be pirated over the internet, putting a dent in potential ticket sales. Still, once bans begin to lift and fears of the virus spreading wane, there is an expectation that people in China will once again flock to cinemas.

Opinion by Chelsea Clinton and Devi Sridhar,2/24/2020,cnn,US may pay price of Trump's ignorance on global health (Opinion),https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/opinions/trump-us-coronavirus-prepared-clinton-sridhar/index.html,"Chelsea Clinton is the Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation and teaches at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia.

Devi Sridhar is a professor at the University of Edinburgh's Medical School and holds the Chair in Global Public Health. Previously, she was associate professor in global health politics at Oxford University. They are the co-authors of ""Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) The coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China, last year is causing alarm across the world, with fear that this could become the next pandemic. Late last month, the World Health Organization declared the virus, named COVID-19, a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" and urged an immediate international response. It advised its member states to put in place national preparedness plans and procedures for identifying and responding to any COVID-19 cases that might present. The death toll of more than 2,600 people far exceeds that of the SARS outbreak nearly 17 years ago. Chelsea Clinton Devi Sridhar This outbreak is terrifying for the tens of millions of people impacted in Wuhan and in countries around the world, and it arguably could not come at a worse time for Americans. There's a famous adage in public health: ""Outbreaks are inevitable; epidemics are not."" Read More That's because experts across virology, genetics, epidemiology, mathematical modeling, political science, and anthropology are working to answer crucial questions, such as: When did the virus make the jump from animals to humans, and from which species? How widespread are cases, how infectious is the disease and how fatal is it? Scientists are also conducting crucial research to help develop a vaccine, diagnose cases more rapidly and develop public health containment strategies. Under former President Barack Obama, infrastructure was established to respond to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks and to ensure that they did not become pandemics. Why coronavirus is an ethical minefield Unfortunately, President Donald Trump has taken actions that many doctors and experts agree will leave the US less prepared to respond to COVID-19. He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding -- thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress. He's shown his antipathy toward addressing health emergencies like this one, most recently in his proposed 2021 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services, which would cut $3 billion from response and preparedness funds. We write this with long experience in global health and having looked closely at outbreak prevention and response in our book, ""Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?"" Two aspects in particular worry us about the White House's response, or lack thereof. We have a President uninterested in global health concerns, broadly disdainful of experts and recently obsessed with and distracted by his impeachment. Trump has often shown deep ignorance and cruelty on issues of global health. During the Ebola outbreak, when he was still a reality TV host, he said the US should not allow Ebola-infected citizens and aid workers to come back to the US and should let them ""suffer the consequences."" He even deliberately spread misinformation, saying Ebola was: ""Spreading all over Africa-and fast. Stop flights"" and ""The U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our 'borders.' Act fast!"" He said this even though halting flights would bring potentially harmful consequences , like ""hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,"" according to the World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Excessive fear of the Wuhan coronavirus can be dangerous In 2014-2015 during the Ebola outbreak, his apparent disdain lived largely on Twitter. Now, in addition to sharing his often false opinions on Twitter , he claimed earlier this month that the coronavirus would weaken in the warmer weather despite no evidence to that effect. The Trump administration is chronically inept at, and seemingly uninterested in, any type of long-term planning, given the numerous positions in government that remain vacant as well as the constant rotation of key cabinet positions and the ad hoc decisions made on the basis of a conversation or Fox News clip. That posture, colliding with an anti-science and anti-expert bias, has corroded our epidemic preparedness. Columbia University has even tracked more than 400 cases of the Trump administration's efforts to restrict or dismiss scientific research, education or discussion, or the publication or use of scientific information since 2016. The dissolution of the entire global health security unit and removal of global health security expert Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council was the final step in a process of undermining one of the Obama administration's key decisions on global health. Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter . Join us on Twitter and Facebook The unit monitored epidemics and ensured that public health planning was coordinated within the more traditional security infrastructure. The lack of a clear chain of command for pandemic response is exactly the opposite of what is needed during an outbreak: clear governance, strategic thinking and forward-planning. To put it simply, the Trump administration, by seeking to cut funding and rejecting proven solutions, is not sufficiently prepared to face a major threat like the novel coronavirus outbreak.  As the American people face what the World Health Organization has deemed a public health emergency, we need a strong leader who understands the importance of good governance, expertise and diverse perspectives in bringing outbreaks under control. The next election provides an opportunity to safeguard the health of people both in the US and around the world. We hope the Democratic candidates will outline what they would do to respond to the current coronavirus crisis and how they would prevent future epidemics through investments in research, expertise and infrastructure.",general

Italy's MIB index was down more than four percent, while declines in global financial powerhouses France and Germany were sharper than normal in European trading. South Korea's KOSPI stock market closed down 3.9 percent following news of seven deaths in the country and 700 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The pan-European Stoxx 600 benchmark also lost 3.5 percent of its value. The Dow Jones fell nearly 900 points at the open. Fear is sweeping through global stock markets, with economists downgrading growth forecasts for China and the wider global economy.

Rabobank analysts warned in a note Monday: Regular readers will know that our four projected COVID-19 scenarios were bad, worse, ugly, and unthinkable'.   Current news today suggests risks that the base case is rapidly shifting from bad,' meaning only China is impacted, to ugly,' where both emerging Asia and developed economies see soaring infection rates and deaths. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""The fear is that we could be looking at a scenario where the virus spreads aggressively in this part of the world too, so traders have the perfect excuse to take profits and get out of stocks because it wasn't that long ago that they were at fairly lofty levels."" AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said: ""There is lots of bad news on the coronavirus front with the total number of new cases still rising. ""Of course, there is much uncertainty about the case data, new cases outside China still looks to be trending up and the economic flow on has further to go with the Chinese economy likely to have contracted in the March quarter.""

Several UK businesses, including carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and Associated British Foods - the owner of clothing retailer Primark - have also reported disruption. Associated British Foods told its shareholders the company had stockpiled products to plant for the extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, adding it was well stocked for the coming months. But the company warned it is ""assessing mitigating strategies"" is case the financial disruption is long-term.  The death toll in China has surged past 2,500 and although reported death rates are falling, restrictions on businesses and the movement of people remain in place. These have been present for over a month, and have left the world's second largest economy fighting to turn its fortunes around. Coronavirus panic has also quickly spread across Europe, with a fifth person dying in Italy and Austria assembling a taskforce to discuss whether to introduce border controls with the neighbouring country. More than 200 people have been infected with COVID-19, with five deaths in the space of 48 hours. The latest victim was an 88-year-old man from the Lombardy region, making him the fourth victim in the area. On Sunday evening, Austria refused entry to a train travelling from Italy because there were two people with fever symptoms on board. Austrian train operator OBB told Sky News all train traffic to and from Italy had been suspended, but that suspension was lifted a few hours later. French director of health Jerome Salomon said the situation was worrying and warned of further cases in the country because of its proximity to Italy. He told the France Info radio station that ""anyone returning from Lombardy or Veneto with symptoms must be considered suspicious"" But he added there are no plans for border controls, while Germany also said it is not yet considering introducing similar measures.

Philip van Doorn,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Here are the worst-performing stocks Monday as investors panic over the coronavirus,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-worst-performing-stocks-monday-as-investors-panic-over-the-coronavirus-2020-02-24?mod=article_inline,"A heightened fear of the coronavirus spread over the weekend amid reports of scores of new infections in Italy, pummeling U.S. stock indexes on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.32% fell  1,032 points, or 3.6%, to close at 27,960.80. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.46% ended 3.4% lower and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.19% dropped 3.7%. Travel-related and technology stocks were hit particularly hard. The world's integrated supply chains have investors worried about potential disruptions among companies based far away from the areas that have been hardest hit by the virus. Many vulnerable people have lived in what Chris Dillon, T. Rowe Price's investment specialist for global capital markets, calls closed-habitat systems. These aren't limited to cruise lines, but include factories with dormitory housing for workers, such as Foxconn Technology 2354, -1.25% FXCOF, , which handles the final assembly of Apple's AAPL, +2.30% iPhones in China. In an interview Feb. 21, Dillon said: Foxconn has told its people not to go back to some of the dormitories, which could hinder a return to normal assembly schedules. Dillon said that while he and colleagues were not understating the human tragedy, it was important for investors to have perspective about the scale of the coronavirus. Last year, 42 million people contracted the flu and 61,000 died in the U.S. alone, he said.

Pierre BrianΓ§on,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Could Europe Deal With the Economic Impact of a Major Coronavirus Outbreak? Here are Some Reasons for Doubt,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/could-europe-deal-with-the-economic-impact-of-a-major-coronavirus-outbreak-here-are-some-reasons-for-doubt-51582551180,"Tourists wearing protective respiratory masks outside the Colosseum in Rome Getty Images The European economy slowed down more than was forecast in the last quarter of 2019, and it is still facing geopolitical risks while it braces for the full impact of Brexit in a few months. Now the coronavirus outbreak has become an economic risk: after Italy imposed a strict quarantine on at least 10 northern towns, it is no longer a distant danger in either space or time. This comes at a moment that could put not only the EU's economy, but its politics and institutions, under serious stress. Italy is Europe's third-largest economy, and its slowest-growing ” GDP is forecast to increase a paltry 0.3% this year, vs 1.2% for the whole eurozone. The coronavirus had been detected in one of the country's most prosperous regions of the industrial north, which could hit manufacturing and exports ” one of the few strengths of the Italian economy. There are already many reasons to doubt Europe's capacity to deal with the problem swiftly and decisively ” even before envisioning an even more serious spread of the virus. The bloc is likely to approach a possible severe crisis in the same way it did the euro crises of the recent past: by bickering and delaying, thus increasing the final cost of the decisions it finally takes. To fight a downturn, Europe can in theory consider fiscal stimulus or monetary easing, and preferably both. But policy makers already seem more eager to offload the hot potato than to think about serious ways to deal with a possible crisis. In the margins of the G20 meeting of finance ministers last weekend, both the French and Italian central bank governors warned that responsibility to deal with the fallout from the virus should fall on governments since the European Central Bank's policy is already loose enough. No matter that this runs contrary to the ECB's official party line, which is that it has, or could always find, new tools or instruments to deal with a worsening economy. The governors' statement is a good advance indication of the game of pass-the-parcel that Europe's policy makers will play when the time comes for serious decisions. On the central bankers' side, the strategic review that ECB President Christine Lagarde seems so keen on promoting could prove a serious distraction if a crisis hits. Until now it seemed that the next ECB governing council meeting in March would merely be an uneventful one, with policy unchanged. But with new risks tacked on a slowing economy, that may no longer be the case. Meanwhile, European governments have just shown how divided they are on fiscal matters in their discussions of the next EU multi-year budget, with an offensive of the self-described frugal countries, led by the Netherlands, who insist on shrinking common spending, in spite of the hole that the lack of U.K. contribution will leave in the budget. There is no doubt where they would stand if the question of a pan-European coordinated fiscal stimulus is raised. Germany has refrained from formally appearing alongside the frugals even though there is no doubt where the heart of German politicians is. But the ruling coalition government is too focused on domestic politics to care much about what to do in Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party was just trounced in regional elections in Hamburg and is still in search of a leader. Uncertainty is for now the only certainty in German politics, with the likelihood of Merkel's early retirement (instead of at the end of the Parliament's term in the fall of 2021) increasing by the day. Should a major crisis erupt now, the German political funk will prove a serious obstacle to European decision-making. Health policy is mostly a national matter, and is not included in the EU's remit . And for now, as UBS chief economist Paul Donovan has noted , fear is what matters economically when talking about the outbreak's impact. But what the EU's responsibility should be is to make sure it would and could help a member country hit disproportionately by the outbreak to cushion its economic consequences. There are reasons to doubt it will be up to the task.",business
Pippa Stevens@PippaStevens13,2/24/2020,cnbc,Turnaround Tuesday? Stocks tend to bounce back quickly from market drops like this one,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/turnaround-tuesday-stocks-tend-to-bounce-back-quickly-from-market-drops-like-this-one.html,"Monday's trading session was a bloodbath for the market as all major indices slid more than 3%, but if history is any indication, Tuesday might prove to be a different story entirely. According to Bespoke Investment Group, Monday was the 19th time the S&P 500 has shed more than 2% on a Monday, going back to March 2009. In the prior instances, following a hefty slide the index has, on average, returned 1.02% the next day as these drops have ""historically been bought with a vengeance in the near term,"" the firm said. Bespoke found that in 17 out of the 18 prior instances the S&P 500 also had a positive return over the subsequent week, with an average gain of 3.16%. Over the next month, there was an average gain of 6.08%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.56%, or 1,031 points on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 3.35% and 3.71%, respectively. Slicing the data even further, Bespoke found that when the S&P 500 drops more than 1% on Friday and more than 2% the following Monday ” as the index has currently done ” Tuesday's gain is, on average, slightly higher at 1.5%. The following week's gain stands at 3.98%, on average, with the subsequent month's gain coming in at 6.47%. Since the SPY, which tracks the S&P 500, began trading in 1993, it has only fallen more than 1% on a Friday and more than 2% the following Monday 13 other times. The last instance was in December 2018. Monday's sell-off was sparked by a surge in reported coronavirus cases outside of China, fueling fears of a prolonged global economic slowdown. ""The fact that the market is down a lot like this today I don't think is surprising given that people are rightly concerned that it may be spreading,"" Bespoke's Paul Hickey said Monday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""We don't know where it will go, and that's the problem ... as data comes in, only time will tell."" He said that data out of China cannot be 100% trusted, meaning that data coming out of other countries is being closely watched, which is why the increase in cases from Italy and South Korea, for example, ""rightfully"" freaked out many investors. ""If we go tonight and there's not another big escalation of cases, I think you could just as easily see the market up strongly tomorrow on some relief,"" he said. - CNBC's Nate Rattner and Jesse Pound contributed reporting.

Pippa Stevens@PippaStevens13,2/24/2020,cnbc,Highlights from Warren Buffett's 2020 Interview with Becky Quick,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/warren-buffet-interview-live-updates.html,"Warren Buffett joined CNBC's Becky Quick with an exclusive three-hour interview on ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. Below are all the highlights: As the coronavirus outbreak sparks fears of a slowdown in global growth, Buffett closed the CNBC interview saying his long-term outlook remains unchanged. ""We're buying businesses to own for 20 or 30 years. We buy them in whole, we buy them in parts ... and we think the 20- and 30-year outlook is not changed by the coronavirus."" ""I think Kraft Heinz should pay down its debt. Under present circumstances, it appears that it can pay the dividend and pay down debt at a reasonable rate,"" Buffett said. ""And it has too much debt, but it doesn't have debt it can't pay down. The debt holders are going to get the interest and the debt should come down by year-end. I think it will, and I think it can with the present dividend."" The Berkshire Chairman said he spoke to Microsoft founder Bill Gates about efforts to contain the spread and impact of the coronavirus. ""Now what they hope to get is a universal flu vaccine, but that's a long way off. It isn't impossible. I mean I asked my own ” my own science advisor is Bill Gates ¦ I talked to him in the last few days about it and he's bullish on the long-term outlook for a universal prevention of it."" ""Cryptocurrencies basically have no value,"" Buffett said, noting that they don't produce anything or mail investors checks. Instead, the value is derived from the belief that someone else will value the more highly in the future. ""In terms of value, you know zero,"" he said. As a conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway is known for acquiring entire businesses. But recently, Berkshire has favored buying shares of companies, but not the entire entity. ""There's quite a premium,"" Buffett said of buying an entire business. ""Part of the premium is because you can borrow so much money so cheaply in buying those businesses."" As the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury sank to its lowest level since July 2016, Buffett said there are ""very unusual conditions."" ""It makes no sense to lend money at 1.4% to the U.S. government, when it's government policy to have 2% per year inflation. The government is telling you we're going to give you 1.4% and tax you on it, and on the other hand we're going to presumably devalue that money at 2% per year. So these are very unusual conditions."" Despite owning a large position in Apple, Buffett famously never had a smartphone ” until now. ""My flip phone is permanently gone,"" he said. Buffett said it's difficult for Berkshire Hathaway to buy back large numbers of its shares. ""It's harder to buy back Berkshire Shares than say Bank of America buying back its stock ... they can really do it without moving the market."" ""Berkshire is held by people that really primarily keep it,"" he said. Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's third largest holding behind insurance and railroads, Buffett said. He called the company ""probably the best business I know in the world."" Berkshire owns roughly 5.5% of the business, he said. Buffett said he would ""certainly"" vote for Mike Bloomberg. ""I don't think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce. But sure, I would have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg."" Buffett said that while he's a Democrat, he's not a ""card-carrying Democrat"" and has voted for Republican candidates in the past. As Sen. Bernie Sanders surges in the polls, Buffett said, ""we will see what happens"" regarding the Democratic nominee. Buffett did say that he's a ""card-carrying capitalist."" In recent years there have been questions about what happens at Berkshire Hathaway in the era after Buffett, who is 89. ""Berkshire without me is worth essentially the same as Berkshire with me. My value added is not high, but I don't think I'm subtracting value,"" he said. ""I feel very good about the banks we own. They're very attractive compared to most other securities I see,"" Buffett said. Banks are a big part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, which is worth more than $248 billion. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, BNY Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp were all among Berkshire's 15 largest stock holdings. Correction: An earlier version misstated Buffett's title. He is chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire has been selling its stake in Wells Fargo, and Buffett said the bank is a ""classic in terms of one lesson,"" which is that the company should have attacked its phony accounts scandal ""immediately."" ""They had an obviously very dumb incentive system,"" Buffett said. ""The big thing is they ignored it when they found out about it."" Buffett said shareholders would be ""a lot better off"" if the bad practices weren't ignored, which was a ""total disaster."" While some have said that Berkshire Hathaway's businesses could be more profitable if the conglomerate were to split, Buffett said that would actually be bad for business. ""You can have spinoffs ¦ you cannot dispose of the entire business without having very substantial tax liabilities,"" he said. ""It would not produce a gain. Having them together, however, produces very valuable synergies."" ""There would not be a profit if we were simply to announce that over the next 24 months you could come in and buy any business we had and we would sell to the highest bidder,"" he added. Buffett said that while the coronavirus outbreak is daunting for the human race, it shouldn't impact investors' portfolio decisions. ""It is scary stuff. I don't think it should affect what you do with stocks, but in terms of the human race it's scary stuff when you have a pandemic,"" he said. Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting is May 2, which Buffett said the coronavirus could ""very well"" impact. The Berkshire Hathaway chief said that investors should not reach for yield beyond their risk-tolerance, even with interest rates so low and stocks seemingly like the only place to get a return. ""Reaching for yield is really stupid. But it is very human,"" he said, delivering sobering advice to folks near or in retirement. ""People say, 'Well, I saved all my life and I can only get 1%, what to do I do? You learn to live on 1%, unfortunately."" Berkshire Hathaway's cash balance now stands at $128 billion, leading some investors to question why the Oracle of Omaha hasn't put the firm's war chest to work. ""We'd like to buy more,"" he said, after being asked about his cash on hand. As passive investing becomes more and more popular, Buffett likened index funds to conglomerates, saying the American public is going ""wild"" with enthusiasm for passive investing. ""You buy 500 businesses all put together, and I mean that's the ultimate conglomerate."" Buffett said that while the U.S. economy still looks healthy, it isn't as robust as it was even half a year ago thanks to a combination of global headwinds. ""It's strong, but a little softer than it was six months ago, but that's over a broad range,"" he said. ""Business is down but it's down from a very good level,"" he added. Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its Wells Fargo position in the fourth quarter, filings revealed, but when Buffett was pressed for why the firm decreased its position he wouldn't reveal why. ""We've bought Bank of America and sold Wells Fargo,"" he said. As the coronavirus outbreak hits stocks, Buffett said, ""a very significant percentage of our businesses one way are affected."" He added, however, that the businesses are being affected by a lot of other things, too, and he said the real question is where those businesses are going to be in five to 10 years. ""They'll have ups and downs,"" he said. Specifically, he pointed to Apple and Dairy Queen being hit, as well as carpet maker Shaw Industries. Buffett said that no matter what's going on in the market, he's always been an overall net buyer of stocks. ""I've been a personal net buyer of stocks ever since I was 11, every year."" ""I haven't bought stocks every day. There have been a few times where I thought stocks have been quite high, but that's very seldom"" he added. As volatility in the market increases because of the coronavirus, Buffett said not to make investing decisions based on day-to-day moves. ""You don't buy or sell your business based on today's headlines. If it gives you a chance to buy something you like and you can buy it even cheaper, you're in good luck,"" he said, adding that ""you can't predict the market by reading the daily newspaper."" As stock futures dropped before Monday's opening bell, Buffett said ""that's good for us."" ""We're a net buyer of stocks over time,"" he said. ""Most people are savers, they should want the market to go down. They should want to buy at a lower price."" - CNBC's Tom Franck, Michael Sheetz and Matthew Belvedere contributed reporting.

Pippa Stevens@PippaStevens13,2/24/2020,cnbc,"Oil slides into bear market territory, posting worst day in more than a month",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/oil-falls-more-than-4percent-sliding-into-bear-market-territory-as-coronavirus-sparks-demand-fears.html,"Oil slid more than 5% at its session low on Monday, falling into bear market territory as the number of coronavirus cases outside of China surged. Investors are worried that a subsequent slowdown in the global economy could dent the demand for crude. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude shed 3.65%, or $1.95, to settle at $51.43 per barrel for its worst day since Jan. 8, while International benchmark Brent crude fell $2.20, or 3.8%, to settle at $56.30 per barrel. At the session low WTI fell to $50.45, while Brent traded as low as $55.13. Prices closed off the lows after Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser reportedly said that the coronavirus impact will be ""short term,"" according to a report from Reuters. Again Capital's John Kilduff said that the $50 level is critical for energy companies. ""This is it, this is the line in the sand. This is where they really start to hurt. This is where they start to not be able to service their debt, this is where the expense ratio does not work for Wall Street, for private equity, for anybody,"" he said Monday on CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange."" Raymond James cut its oil outlook on Monday as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. ""There is no escaping the fact that China ” the world's largest oil importer ” will have meaningfully weaker near-term oil demand than we had envisioned as the year began,"" analyst Pavel Molchanov wrote in a note to clients. Molchanov said demand in the first quarter will be reduced by an average of 1.5 million barrels per day. He said that a warmer-than-normal winter across the Northern Hemisphere is also hitting demand. Total confirmed cases of the coronavirus now stands at more than 79,400, while the death toll is more than 2,621. On Monday Italian news agency ANSA said that a seventh person has died in the country, with the number of confirmed cases exceeding 220. Citi was among the other firms cutting its oil outlook as cases of the coronavirus accelerate. ""The oil market is confronting new signs of weakness, largely from the coronavirus and its impacts on refinery demand for crude oil and from Russia's refusal to agree to an emergency OPEC+ meeting to curb oil production,"" the firm said in a note to clients. Citi said that it now believes inventories could grow to 2 million barrels per day in February alone, which will put ""even more sustained pressure on prices."" A week ago, the firm's forecast stood at a potential build of over one million barrels per day for the quarter. The firm also raised its first quarter build projection from 112 million barrels to 145 million barrels, and lifted its second quarter forecast from 53 million barrels to 94 million barrels. ""However, our draws for 3Q are lower vs. last week's estimates,"" the firm added. Molchanov added that since the virus and weather issues are transitory, ""the global oil market will need sustainably higher prices in order to avoid a major undersupply in 2021 and beyond."" - CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

Officials also praised the amazing staff at the National Biosafety Laboratory, China's only Level 4 microbiology lab. It comes after Mr Mosher, President of the Population Research Institute, said he believed the deadly coronavirus had escaped from the National Biosafety Laboratory. But Danielle Anderson, assistant professor and virologist at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, dismissed the claims, saying the lab staff were incredibly competent and excellent scientists. She told Health Feedback: I have worked in this exact laboratory at various times for the past two years. I can personally attest to the strict control and containment measures implemented while working there. The staff at WIV are incredibly competent, hardworking, and are excellent scientists with superb track records. Writing for the New York Post, Mr Mosher pointed to a directive released by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology which was entitled Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus. Mr Mosher said: Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn't it? And just how many microbiology labs' are there in China that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus'? But Ms Anderson said this was not unusual and this directive would be put in place immediately. She added: This sort of directive is something that is put in place immediately when dealing with a new pathogen. I can guarantee that every research lab or hospital that handles the virus, virus derivatives, patients, or patient samples has drafted a similar mandate. I know that all the institutes that my work falls under have done so. It is a positive directive designed to enhance safety. This was also supported by Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He said: Any responsible government would strengthen safety and security procedures in high-containment# labs that will and should be working with the novel coronavirus to develop countermeasures and diagnostics. And Peter Daszak, epidemiologist and president of the EcoHealth Alliance, warned against conspiracy theories saying they had real consequences. He told Journal Science: These rumours and conspiracy theories have real consequences, including threats of violence that have occurred to our colleagues in China. More than 2,470 people have been killed by the outbreak of the deadly virus, with most of them in China, since it emerged in Wuhan City in December. While there have been more than 79,000 suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Sorry, we are unable to accept comments about this article at the moment.

Rebekah Evans,2/24/2020,express,Coronavirus news: Experts warn outbreak could turn into PANDEMIC - more cases in UK and It,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1246691/coronavirus-news-covid-19-latest-UK-Italy-South-Korea-Iran-diamond-princess," New cases have been reported in the UK over the weekend, and parts of Italy have been placed into lockdown after a spike in reported cases. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at Exeter University, said: It is clear that all the important ingredients for a pandemic are now present. It's better to be honest and say it. The fresh instances of coronavirus in the UK all derived from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The ship had been quarantined for a number of weeks off the coast of Yokohama, Japan and was later evacuated. Passengers touched down in the UK at Boscombe Down military base, Wiltshire, on Saturday. However, the next day, it emerged that although patients were tested in Japan, their positive results for coronavirus did not arrive until they were back in the UK.   Four people who boarded the plane were confirmed to have the deadly disease. NHS England have said the people are now in hospitals across the UK - two in Sheffield, one in Liverpool and a fourth in Newcastle. Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England said: Four further patients in England have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to thirteen.  READ MORE: Coronavirus patient at large: Woman flees hospital and evades police  The virus was passed on in the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the patients are being transferred from Arrowe Park to specialist NHS infection centres. Meanwhile, in Italy, eleven towns across Lombardy and Veneto have been put into lockdown. These areas are often popular with British holidaymakers, some of whom have spent the half-term holiday in these regions. The rise in cases in Italy combined with a sharp spike in infections in Iran and South Korea has led experts to believe it is simply too late to be able to contain the virus.  DON'T MISSHolidays: Britons admit they would cancel travel over coronavirus [REVEALED]Coronavirus UK: COVID-19 can spread WITHOUT showing symptoms [SHOCK]Coronavirus: WHO reveals major protective' measure to combat virus [INSIGHT]   Six people have died in South Korea so far, with President Moon Jae-in placing the country on the highest level of alert. 600 people have been reported to have been struck down by the virus, which exhibits itself in flu-like symptoms. Iran has reported eight deaths from a total of 43 cases.   Professor Devi Sridhar, the director of Edinburgh University's global health governance programme, said: The window of opportunity to contain the outbreak is closing very quickly. And, Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an infectious diseases expert at King's College London told The Telegraph: The evolving situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy is very concerning. There has been the expectation that some countries might develop person to person transmission of SARS-COV2 following an imported case of infection from an affected country.   What is concerning is the lack of clear contact with such an individual in initiating clusters in these three countries, and particularly in Iran and Italy. This suggests that there has potentially been transmission from an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individual who had not been tested for SARS-COV2. If such a situation is true, then the chance of significant transmission from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals occurring within these populations for a period of time before the first cases were identified increases. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
Reshma Kapadia,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Coronavirus Is Cratering the Stock Market. Why It Can Still Get Worse.,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/coronavirus-is-cratering-the-stock-market-why-it-can-still-get-worse-51582568936,"Venice cut short its Carnival ; Beijing postponed its annual legislative session in mid-March and cases of the Coronavirus in South Korea soared , with companies like
        Samsung temporarily closing factories. Some strategists are beginning to reassess their view that the impact of the deadly outbreak would be contained to the first quarter”now warning that markets may be too complacent. The World Health Organization on Monday said the COVID-19 outbreak isn't a pandemic because it is not spreading in an uncontained way. Still, the spread of the virus to more countries, including South Korea” an export hub from components and chips that go into the world's gadgets”rattled investors trying to assess the economic damage. The S&P 500 fell 2.6% to 3249 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 800 points to 28193.75. Influenza has killed more people than the coronavirus, but the uncertainty around this virus has caused companies and countries to take much more extreme measures that are rippling through the economy. Italian officials shut down schools and museums and banned public and private gatherings in the northern part of the country as Italy became the site of the world's third biggest national outbreak of the deadly virus after South Korea and China. Roughly 24 million people and Italy's industrial hubs around Milan, Turin and Venice are under restrictions so far. Expectations for a pickup in South Korea's recovery have been upended and Xi Jinping said Sunday prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage amid concerns the outbreak could accelerate as Beijing begins to lift travel restrictions. That is causing some reassessment among strategists who have largely expected a short-term hit from the virus with a sharp rebound once companies try to recoup some of the lost demand and central bankers offer stimulus, but there is growing uncertainty around the shape of any possible recovery. Read Next: Inside Berkshire Hathaway's Future Without Warren Buffett BlackRock Investment Institute's strategists wrote in a note that they maintained their moderate tactical overweight to quality stocks but were reviewing their overall risk orientation and tactical views, citing the coronavirus outbreak. Gavekal Resarch's Andrew Batson warned the risk was far from priced, warning that the economic damage from the coronavirus closures will be more prolonged than the market currently hopes, and that the policy response from authorities is less forceful than market expectations. Even as roughly half of major industrial companies in areas like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai had reopened, few were back at full strength and the world's second largest economy still looks to be operating at less than half of normal capacity, Batson wrote. In an informal survey of clients about the virus, DataTrek Research found that more than a third had already shifted portfolios. The recent volatility may push the other two-thirds to take similar moves”and that could mean more pressure on markets, wrote DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas in a note on Monday. As for when China's economy could bounce back from the hit, Colas found little consensus among respondents, adding that it may be more of a 2021 event rather than a late 2020 one. In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin wrote that most corporate managements in quarterly calls anticipated only a temporary impact from the outbreak and optimism about a continued economic expansion. But companies with high China sales had underperformed the MSCI China by 5 percentage points since Wuhan implemented travel restrictions on Jan. 23. Also concerning: The correlation between the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the S&P 500 Index sits at a four-year high, wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note to clients. We see stock prices as vulnerable, so if interest rates were to back up suddenly, the diversification that bonds usually provide could fail, she writes. So what should investors do to better prepare their portfolios? Shalett's recommendation to clients: Consider lightening up on secular growth stocks that have done well and adding to undervalued cyclical stocks in areas like financials, industrials, energy and commodities. Almost three-quarters of those who responded to Colas' survey said technology, discretionary or energy were the most vulnerable. Not only does the discretionary sector have sizable China exposure, with McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE) and Starbucks (SBUX) accounting for more than 15% of that sector. Also a possible issue: Amazon (AMZN), which accounts for more than a quarter of the sector, is trading at 72 times forward earnings, Colas notes. As a result, the playbook for investors to dial down risk includes selling technology, discretionary and energy and buying staples and health care, Colas says. Though communication services fared relatively well in its survey of clients, Colas says it is too overweight high-valuation stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) to offer a haven for investors. And an inverted yield curve could hold financials back. Past global health related concerns led to short-term market corrections averaging 8%, writes Citi Private Bank's Chief Investment Officer Steven Wieting. Instead of piling into expensive defensives”like U.S. Treasury bonds and utility stocks”he recommends using shorter-term hedging strategies instead. The good news? Only a quarter of those surveyed by DataTrek see the virus triggering a global recession. That should be enough to limit stocks' reaction to a pullback rather than a full-on rout, Colas writes. Let's hope he's right. Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.com",business
Reuters,2/24/2020,theguardian,Primark owner says coronavirus threatens clothing supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/24/primark-owner-coronavirus-abf-uk,"Primark's owner, Associated British Foods, has warned there is a risk of shortages of some clothing lines later this year if delays in factory production in China are prolonged because of the coronavirus. The virus has killed more than 2,400 and infected more than 77,000 people in China, and slowed growth in the world's second largest economy. ABF, which sources more than 40% of Primark's products from China, said it typically built inventories in advance of the lunar new year, meaning it was well stocked for several months and did not expect any short-term impact. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. The group, which maintained its overall financial guidance for the full 2019-20 year, said it was working closely with its suppliers in China to assess the impact of the virus on their factories and supply chains and their ability to fulfil its current orders. If delays to factory production are prolonged, the risk of supply shortages on some lines later this financial year increases, it said. We are assessing mitigating strategies, including a step up in production from existing suppliers in other regions. Shares in ABF, the majority of which are owned by the family of the chief executive, George Weston, were down 2% in early trading, paring gains over the last year to 9.5%. Shares in Primark's British clothing rivals Next and Marks & Spencer were down 2.5% and 3.8% respectively. The ABF finance director, John Bason, said Primark was talking to suppliers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Turkey and eastern Europe to fill the potential gap, although he said some items manufactured in China could not be replicated. There are accessories or whatever, areas like that, that China is very good at that are harder to source from elsewhere ... So I'm not guaranteeing that we can replace all of the shortfall from China, he told Reuters. ABF also owns major sugar, grocery, ingredients and agriculture arms. Several of its food businesses have operations in China. It said the China sugar processing campaign had been completed in January, before the coronavirus outbreak developed significantly. However, its AB Mauri, AB Agri and Ovaltine factories are operating at reduced capacity because of labour and logistics constraints caused by the virus outbreak. Bason said the impact was not material to the overall group. For its first half to 29 February, ABF forecast sales and operating profit ahead of the previous year. Primark's first-half sales were forecast to be up 4.2%, with like-for-like sales level. British sales were forecast up 3.0%, with sales in the eurozone expected to be up 5.3%.",general
Riccardo Bastianello,2/24/2020,reuters,"After the floods, Venice struggles with coronavirus hit",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-italy-venice/after-the-floods-venice-struggles-with-coronavirus-hit-idUSKCN20I1YM,"Scarcely have floods that hit Venice last year receded than the coronavirus has posed a new threat to the lagoon city's billion-euro tourism industry, shutting carnival for the first time in 50 years and fuelling fears of a second economic virus. By Monday lunchtime, authorities had identified 32 cases in the Veneto region, including four in Venice itself, part of an outbreak across northern Italy that has brought more than 220 confirmed cases and at least six deaths. As part of preventive measures that included closing off the worst-affected towns near Italy's business capital Milan, closing schools and universities and calling off sports events, authorities canceled the last two days of the Venice carnival. It was the first time the historic carnival, with its fantastical 18th century masks and costumes, has been shut down early since it was revived in the 1970s. I think the government has been excessively prudent, to use a euphemism, it's as though there were an Ebola epidemic, said Marco Michielli, head of Veneto's hoteliers' association Federalberghi. Cancellations are raining down all over the region, like in the rest of Italy. Coming on top of the disastrous floods that surged through the city streets last November, washing into sites including the historic Saint Mark's Basilica and sending tourists wading for safety, the coronavirus has hit hard. Venice has had some pretty bad luck recently, said Marco Pusiol, a traditional glassblower in Murano, a district of Venice where the craft has been practiced for centuries and which was already struggling after the floods. We're talking about zero takings, days and days without seeing a single customer coming into the shop. Venice remains one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, attracting more than 1 million visitors from China alone last year, but the twin impact of flooding and disease has left it reeling. For the disoriented tourists who could still be seen wandering in the city streets, some in anti-sickness face masks and some still wearing their carnival costumes, the weekend left little to celebrate. Stopping the carnival two days before the end is useless. It's just a show for the media to reassure people, said carnival goer Francesca Rota. Even before the outbreak was announced last Friday, the carnival season was off to a bad start with normally fully booked hotel rooms still available and reservations down 30% on a normal year, according to officials from the Venice hoteliers association. The figure was now getting close to a 40-50% fall, similar to the level seen during last year's floods. Carnival brings us about 40% of our takings for the year for a hotel sector that's worth 2 billion euros a year, not counting all the associated businesses, said Daniele Minetti, the association's vice-president. For 2020 as a whole, there's certain to be a hit. Additional reporting by Oriana Boselli, Writing by James Mackenzie, editing by Ed Osmond",business
Robert Cyran,2/24/2020,reuters,Breakingviews,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-breakingviews/breakingviews-virus-hits-markets-the-way-trade-war-didnt-idUSKCN20I2ER," - First came trade war, now a rapidly spreading global virus. It's the latter that has investors more nervous. Monday saw the S&P 500 Index fall over 3%, while Treasury yields hit a record low. The anxiety is overdue, because the potential impact of the disease known as Covid-19 is serious business. Protectionism hurts economies, but gradually, mostly affecting prices and demand rather than availability. Yet closures in Chinese factories, and production squeezes caused by rural workers staying away, hit hard and fast. The People's Republic is the world's biggest goods exporter, accounting for 13% of global merchandise exports according to the World Trade Organization. It produces over 25% of computing and electrical exports McKinsey Global Institute estimates. Apple has already warned of the risk of iPhone shortages. But there are more essential products to think of. China only accounts for 4% of global pharmaceutical exports, for example, but it's the biggest producer of many cheap drugs “ about 80% of U.S. antibiotics come from China “ and the sole provider of chemicals needed to make others. The auto trade in particular depends on a steady supply of items. Cars have tens of thousands of parts, and some have no easy substitutes. Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai Motor have idled plants in Serbia and South Korea over missing Chinese parts, and other manufacturers have said they are down to a few weeks of supplies. China's 3% of global car exports doesn't give the full picture of how integrated the system is. The S&P 500 is up by around 15% since President Donald Trump started imposing tariffs on America's trade partners in early 2018. Even with Monday's fall, the S&P 500 is down about 1% since the start of the year “ about the time first reports of a new disease in China emerged. Yet clusters of Covid-19 emerging in South Korea, Japan and Italy raise the risk that exports from these nations could also become scarce “ leading to a compounding of supply chain problems. Supply chains are only as strong as their weakest link, and a whole lot more stress is probably coming. Markets haven't yet grasped how big this problem could be, but they are finally waking up to the fact that it is one.

Ferrari's factory and headquarters are in Maranello, just south of the Lombardy region where a bulk of the more than 220 cases in the country are concentrated. Ferrari said it hasn't halted production, but it has closed both Ferrari museums in Maranello and in Modena as requested by local authorities. It has also ""restricted access for employees that are residents or have visited the affected municipalities,"" and has suspended visits from tourists ” including its popular factory tours -- as well as ""all non-critical business travel."" The company said ""new measures will be promptly implemented and communicated should they become necessary."" Ferrari's share price fell by about 5% Monday after reports of the outbreak, mostly in Italy's Lombardy region, which includes Milan. A dozen towns went into effective lockdown, closing schools, businesses and restaurants and canceling public events. Ferrari produced over 10,000 cars at its Maranello factory and Ferrari fans around the world make the pilgrimage to the factory and museum for tours.",finance
Robyn Mak,2/24/2020,reuters,Breakingviews,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-virus-recovery-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinese-consumers-imperil-v-shaped-virus-rebound-idUKKCN20I096," - Weak Chinese consumption may outlast the coronavirus. A slowdown in new Covid-19 cases outside Hubei province, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, is feeding investor optimism. Signs of stress, though, hint at a slower recovery. Official figures put new confirmed cases across mainland China at 648 on Saturday, up from 397 a day earlier, bringing the country's total to nearly 77,000. That reverses a few days of decline. And despite worrisome spreads in other countries, new infections and deaths outside Hubei have been falling. These numbers, along with lending-rate cuts, have fueled a stock market rally. After tumbling 10% from the start of the year through early February, China's CSI300 has bounced back to December levels. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark index also has recaptured earlier losses. The optimism mirrors the SARS epidemic. The number of new cases peaked in China in February 2003 and in Hong Kong two months later. Between January and April, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index fell 10%, and was followed by a 50% surge over the next seven months. Likewise, China's real GDP growth slowed to 9.1% in the second quarter; by the third and fourth quarters, the pace reached 10% again. There are widespread expectations for something of a repeat. In one emblematic example, Standard Chartered analysts forecast Chinese growth to dip to 2.8% in the three months to March before bouncing back to 6.5% in the second quarter. This V-shaped recovery largely assumes the virus will burn out by March or April. Scepticism is warranted, though. Some scientists attribute the reduction in new cases to revised counting methods. And this weekend's spike in infections across South Korea, Italy and elsewhere raise fresh questions about containment efforts, despite travel bans and quarantines. Moreover, China's post-SARS rebound was led by its industrial sector, which accounted for 60% of GDP growth, according to Fitch Ratings. Today, consumers matter more. Nine sectors responsible for 42% of economic activity, including real estate, will be hit most by falling domestic demand, StanChart reckons. High debt levels also reduce the effectiveness of monetary stimulus and weak demand from abroad could hammer exporters, which are big employers. Frozen salaries and mass layoffs present a rising risk. Car sales in China cratered 92% in February from a year earlier, while major property developers like Evergrande are offering steep discounts. The prospects for a quick and sustained recovery are looking shakier, or at least more distant. It will take far more this time around to nurse China's consumers back to health.

He continued: Today, there is only one infected patient in France, who is hospitalised in Lyon. His health condition is not worrying. All the others, apart from an 80-year-old man who died, were released cured and are not contagious. M Veran later told a press conference he was keeping a close eye on the serious situation in neighbouring Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe. Speaking on Sunday, he said: The situation tonight is very evolutive at an international level. We are paying particular attention to the situation in Italy. I spoke with my Italian and German counterparts. ""We have agreed to hold a meeting between several European health ministers probably next week to discuss ways to tackle a possible epidemic. But the situation in France is stable, he insisted, adding that no new cases had been reported to date.  We must find a European solution to the health crisis, he told France 2 television on Sunday evening. Cases of the new coronavirus in Italy rose over the weekend to more than 150, killing five people and prompting the government to block off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. China, for its part, reported another drop in new infections outside of its epicentre on Sunday, but world health officials warned it was too early to make predictions about the outbreak as new cases and fears of contagion flared up elsewhere. On Sunday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned the deadly virus had put the global economy at risk.  On the sidelines of a two-day meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, he said: The risk is now confirmed, and so is the impact on the global economy, and it is a real concern for all G20 members. We are ready to take any additional measures if necessary to cope with a possible worsening of the impact on the global economy. M Le Maire also said France should aim to produce more strategic goods, such as drugs and electric batteries, as the coronavirus outbreak exposes the danger of relying on imports from China. He added: It's not protectionism, it's just responsibility. Paris on Friday announced a raft of measures to assist French companies affected by the fallout from the epidemic.

Ryan Browne@Ryan_Browne_,2/24/2020,cnbc,Huawei Mate Xs: New foldable phone unveiled by Chinese tech giant,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/huawei-mate-xs-new-foldable-phone-unveiled-by-chinese-tech-giant.html,"Huawei is giving foldable smartphones another go after debuting its first one, the Mate X, last year. The Chinese tech giant will sell it in Europe for 2,499 euros ($2,700), making it even more expensive than the original. The company's latest folding device, aptly named the Mate Xs, feels more like an update to the previous version as it looks almost identical, but it feels like a much sturdier device thanks to a more robust hinge. The Mate Xs has a new hinge design which comes packed with more materials than its predecessor, and this shows when folding it out into a flat tablet-like screen. You have to tap a button on the back to fold it outward, and I could hear ” and feel ” an audible crunching noise when opening the device out in full. Huawei says this isn't something to be worried about as it's simply the hinge working as it's been designed to. But it's not the easiest folding action and I wasn't confident enough to open it up without using both hands. Like the first model, Huawei's Mate Xs has a plastic display that folds backward, meaning the screen is always exposed. When closed, you're holding a standard-sized 6.6-inch smartphone with an additional slightly smaller 6.38-inch screen on the back. But open it up and you get a massive 8-inch panel on par with that of a tablet. There's not a whole lot that separates the Mate Xs from the Mate X. The hardware seems mostly unchanged apart from the inclusion of Huawei's flagship 5G Kirin 990 chipset, itself an update to the Kirin 980 which powered the original Mate X. And its predecessor also came with 5G support anyway. It does run very smoothly though, and that performance is helped in part by a redesigned cooling system. The Shenzhen, China-based firm had originally planned to unveil the new phone at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, but switched to a pre-recorded broadcast after the event was cancelled due to fears over the new coronavirus. Huawei only sold its Mate X phone in China, at a steep price of 16,999 yuan ($2,420). At $2,700, the Mate Xs is even pricier than its original, and that may be a hard sell with some consumers. The Mate Xs comes with some pretty nifty features, like the ability to multitask with several apps on the screen. Drag your finger across the phone from the right and it'll show a sidebar of apps that you can pull out and open. The phone can display up to three apps at a time. Then there's the camera, which takes advantage of the fact that there's two screens on one phone. When folding the handset shut, the screen on the front will show the main viewfinder. But turn it around and the phone lets you take a selfie. But again, while it's a good utilization of the phone's folding display, this isn't different to what Huawei's Mate X was already capable of. The Mate Xs camera from Leica also comes with the same quad-lens system as that of the Mate X. As for the name of the product, it's not something that detracts from its quality in any way. But it does sound awfully similar to Apple's iPhone X and iPhone XS phones ” although Apple shelved the ""X"" branding with its latest flagship, the iPhone 11, last year. Speaking of Apple, the U.S. hardware giant hasn't dipped its own toes into the foldable arena just yet. But there have been plenty of alternatives from the likes of Samsung, Motorola and Chinese start-up Royole. I got a hands-on with Samsung's new folding handset, the Galaxy Z Flip, and though I didn't get to compare it directly with Huawei's Mate Xs, it's clear that they're two very different products. Whereas the Galaxy Z Flip took on a new form factor with its flip phone or ""clamshell"" design, the Mate Xs sticks with a style more akin to Samsung's first folding device, the Galaxy Fold, the main difference being that the latter opens and closes more like a book. There have been worries about just how durable these gadgets are ” especially after review units of the Galaxy Fold broke for reviewers last year ” and whether Huawei's latest venture into folding phones will stand the test of time remains to be seen. I thought the Z Flip would do a good job in putting those fears at ease, as the hinge on that device was pretty solid. Reports that its so-called ""ultra thin glass"" screens scratch like plastic displays aren't particularly promising ” although Samsung has said this is because the glass is covered with a protective plastic layer. A key drawback for any new Huawei phone now is the fact that none of them can include Google's Android mobile operating system or associated apps like Maps and YouTube. That's because the company was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist last year. Washington took things up a notch recently, bringing racketeering charges against the Chinese tech giant. American officials allege Huawei's telecommunications equipment could enable spying from Beijing, a claim the company has repeatedly denied. The U.S. has also urged allies to block Huawei from their 5G networks, though the U.K. recently resisted those calls. ""Our first preference would be to use the full version of Google,"" Peter Gauden, senior product marketing manager for Huawei's consumer business, told a group of reporters. ""In the absence of that, we are having to go in a different direction and do things for ourselves."" The firm has instead been using a ""forked"" version of Android, copying the basic open source code of Google's operating system and creating its own independent one to get around the trade restrictions. Huawei is also working on its own alternative to Google software, called Harmony, but isn't using it for the new phone. Another potential headwind facing the company is the coronavirus outbreak, which forced the organizers of MWC, world's the biggest mobile phone industry conference, to cancel the event. Several big tech firms, from Ericsson to Amazon, had pulled out ahead of time due to fears over the risks the virus posed for their staff. ""Right now, we're not seeing any impact logistically"" as a result of coronavirus, Gauden said, adding that the firm has taken ""precautions"" to ensure there's enough stock available to meet demand.",finance
Ryan Browne@Ryan_Browne_,2/24/2020,cnbc,Huawei launches Sound X smart speaker in Europe to rival Amazon Echo,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/huawei-launches-sound-x-smart-speaker-in-europe-to-rival-amazon-echo.html,"Huawei is launching its first ever smart speaker outside China. The Shenzhen-based firm created the new speaker, called the Huawei Sound X, in partnership with French audio specialists Devialet. It's already available in Huawei's home market, but the company is now releasing it across some European countries ” namely Germany, France, Italy and Spain ” as well. A price and release date for the new device are yet to be announced. While it doesn't yet include a digital assistant like Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant, Huawei said it's likely it will introduce one later down the line. In China, the speaker comes with Huawei's own voice assistant, called Xiaoyi. Devialet is known for its premium Gold Phantom speaker, which packs a serious punch when it comes to bass. At a massive $3,000, though, the top of the range gadget doesn't come cheap. The company is among France's fastest-growing tech firms and has won backing from the likes of U.S. rapper Jay-Z and LVMH's billionaire CEO Bernard Arnault. The firm recently partnered with France's Paris Opera to fill out the Palais Garnier with its Phantom speakers. With Huawei, Devialet has built two subwoofers ” loudspeakers which enable low-pitched audio frequencies ” into the speaker which push against each other to cancel out any vibrations from the body of the device. The companies claim it is capable of creating 360-degree sound and will be able to reach a much louder maximum volume than competitors. The Chinese tech giant, which faces intense political pressure from the United States, unveiled the speaker along with a new foldable phone and PCs during a pre-recorded broadcast. Its initial aim was to launch the new products at Mobile World Congress, but Huawei was forced to make alternative arrangements as the event was canceled for the first time in its 33-year history due to the coronavirus outbreak. In 2019, the global smart speaker market was dominated by obvious players like Amazon and Google, which held 26% and 20% of the market respectively, though their market share declined from the previous year. But according to Strategy Analytics, which published those figures, Chinese vendors like Baidu, Alibaba and Xiaomi have been snatching market share from the U.S. giants, while Apple's HomePod still struggles at sixth place.",finance

""Fear of the virus is spreading throughout the country, at a much faster rate than the virus itself,"" Marie Kim and Jeeho Yoon from Citi wrote. ""We expect the economic fallout to not be limited to certain regions (and) cities."" The total number of cases rose to 833 on Monday afternoon, compared to 31 cases reported as of Feb. 18, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's a jump that's nearly 27 times higher ” within about one week. Most of the new cases were detected in the city of Daegu and the surrounding Gyeongbuk area. The country's death toll rose to seven on Monday morning and remained unchanged in the afternoon update. In a Monday morning note, the Citi economists explained that consumption in the country is declining as part of people's efforts to minimize human contact. Stores and factories are also shutting down for various reasons, including fear of exposure to the virus, lack of supply inputs or due to continuing loss, the Citi economists said. On Sunday, the government raised the virus alert to its highest level ” red ” and stepped up quarantine measures to slow the virus' spread. The same day, the education minister also said the new school year, due to start next month, will be postponed, Yonhap reported. More such measures are likely to be announced, experts said. Kim and Yoon said they expect the government to introduce a large supplementary budget to mitigate the economic fallout ahead of April elections.

The majority of those quarantined are thought to be diplomats stationed in the capital city of Pyongyang, Yonhap news agency reported Monday, citing state media in North Korea. It was not immediately clear how long the quarantine period would last, while the nationalities of those in isolation have not yet been revealed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said it has had no indication of COVID-19 having spread to North Korea. The virus, which first emerged in China late last year, has since spread to more than two dozen countries. The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency. On Monday, China's National Health Commission reported an additional 409 cases of the coronavirus, with 150 deaths. That brings the total number of confirmed infections to 77,150, with 2,592 deaths nationwide. South Korea, which has reported the highest number of cases outside China, has confirmed more than 763 cases of the coronavirus nationwide, with a total of seven deaths. The country is separated from North Korea by the so-called demilitarized zone (DMZ), which is approximately 154 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. Italy has reported the highest number of cases in Europe, with more than 150 confirmed infections of the deadly flu-like virus. As part of efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, North Korea has reportedly intensified medical monitoring and testing measures on those who have returned from overseas travel and those showing ""abnormal"" symptoms. North Korea has also put measures in place to ensure all foreigners coming into the country must be quarantined for a period of 30 days. The isolated regime has repeatedly denied any confirmed cases of the coronavirus. That's despite concerns North Korea would be vulnerable to an outbreak given it shares a long and porous border with China and lacks vital medical supplies and infrastructure to cope with a fast-spreading virus. Late last week, North Korea canceled its Pyongyang Marathon amid heightened fears about COVID-19. The race had been scheduled to take place in April.",finance

As the epidemic sweeps through China with large outbreaks in Italy and South Korea, many fear the virus was foretold by the Christian Bible. Religious fundamentalists have flooded social media in the past two months with prophecies pulled out of the Bible's Book of Revelation. The Trumpet Daily Radio show joined the chorale of doomsday preachers with host Stephen Flurry citing passages from scripture. Mr Flurry read out on air fragments of the Bible, which he believes prove the coronavirus is a harbinger of doom. He quoted Ezekiel 38:22, which reads: I will plead against him with pestilence and the blood. Mr Flurry then said: God is pleading, he's pleading. We know there's all kinds of imminent pestilence epidemics that are going to sweep across this world during the Great Tribulation. READ MORE: Coronavirus panic: Fury as cruise goers trapped with infected Brits   But what about the lead up to it? Jesus talked of this in Matthew 24. Revelation 6 talks about the Seven Seals.

That pale horse in verse eight. Behold the pale horse.' it says and his name that sat upon him was Death and Hell followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the world to kill with the sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the Earth.' And so this is prophesied to get to worse, much worse. A fourth part of the Earth? Why this is just a drop in the bucket. A handful of people that contracted the virus here in the UK or tens of thousands in Wuhan? What about when this is fulfilled? You can also read about a related image in Zechariah 6. We know there's all kinds of imminent pestilence epidemics that are going to sweep across this world Stephen Flurry, The Trumpet The coronavirus, which appeared in China's Wuhan City last year, has spread like wildfire through mainland China. Although the virus has been mostly contained with the country's borders, individual infections worldwide have sparked fears of a pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) believes the virus can be contained and treated in due time.

Since it emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, scientists have scrambled to contain the outbreak. At least 30 counties have been affected by the disease so far and the number of new infections breifly appeared to be dwindling. On Wednesday, February 19, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed 1,872 new infections globally. The day before, 1,901 new infections were confirmed, and on Monday, the number stood at 2,162.

He tweeted on Monday (Ferbruary 17): Again, none of these are theories' and certainly not conspiracy theories'. They are hypotheses that ought to be studied in light of the evidence, if the Chinese Communist Party would provide it. But the doom-mongering conspiracies were strongly denounced by scientists who issued a joint statement on the situation yesterday.

The scientists published their statement in The Lancet, a journal that has seen an influx of coronavirus studies since December last year. The statement reads: The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.

Stan Schroeder,2/24/2020,mashable,Sony Xperia 1 II has 5G and triple rear camera,https://mashable.com/article/sony-xperia-1-ii/," Monday, Feb. 24, was supposed to be the first day of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where Sony was scheduled to launch new Xperia smartphones. Due to coronavirus fears, the MWC was canceled, but Sony still had its press event, albeit only in the form of an online stream. At the event, Sony launched its new flagship phone, the Sony Xperia 1 II. It's the company's first 5G device, and “ typically for Sony “ it packs some powerful camera tech. In terms of design, though, Sony hasn't strayed from its way, meaning the Sony Xperia 1 II looks utilitarian. The 6.5-inch OLED display has thick bezels both on top and bottom, and on the back there's a vertically oriented triple camera sensor. The phone will be available in black and purple, with Sony primarily pushing the black color in its press materials. It's not a bad look overall, but in a world where bezels are universally shunned, the Xperia 1 II is a bit old-fashioned.  Image:  Sony The specs are pretty good, though. The Xperia 1 II has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor with 5G, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 4,000mAh battery with fast charging and IP65/68 water resistance. The 6.5-inch display has a 21:9 aspect ratio with a 3,840x1,644 resolution and motion blur reduction, which should provide for a smooth image (Sony says it's the equivalent of a 90Hz display). Stereo speakers are on board, as is Dolby Atmos support. A pleasant surprise: the Xperia 1 II also has a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the software side, the phone will ship with Android 10. SEE ALSO: Sony randomly announced a concept car at CES just because they could The cameras on the back (wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto) all have a 12-megapixel resolution, which doesn't sound like much these days (remember, Samsung's new Galaxy S20 Ultra has a 108-megapixel sensor). But Sony claims the cameras can do things other smartphone cameras can't, like do 20fps burst shots which are great for taking photos of sporting events. Sony also claims the camera has a very fast and accurate autofocus in low light conditions, and intelligent eye tracking (for both humans and animals) is on board as well. Finally, the phone can take 2K, 10-bit HDR video at 120fps or 4K video at 60fps (though recording time is limited). There's no word on the price, but the Xperia 1 II will be available in Europe in ""late spring.""",tech

This would explain the ""Airpods"" name, which doesn't have the capitalized P in the Target listing and is unlikely to correspond with an actual AirPods device. Apple's most expensive earbuds are AirPods Pro, which retail for $249. On its own, this listing could mean a lot of different things; for example, Apple already sells Beats-branded headphones, some of which cost a similar amount. One example is Beats Studio 3, which cost $349.95. But rumors of Apple launching Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones have been around since 2018, and there's reason to believe they'll finally materialize. This is because rumors and reports indicate that Apple plans to have an event in March, where it will launch a new affordable iPhone, dubbed either the iPhone SE 2 or iPhone 9. The company is also rumored to be launching AirTags wireless trackers, as well as updated iPad and MacBook devices. Perhaps we'll see the new headphones at that event as well, as recently indicated by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. We don't know much about the new headphones, except that they'll likely have noise-cancelling tech, and that they might share some audio DNA with Apple's HomePod speaker. Also listed in Target's systems is an iPod Touch X generation and a display unit iPad 10.5 XThe iPod Touch X is almost CERTAINLY the new $400 iPhone. It comes in 6 SKUs, so possibly 6 color options.The iPad 10.5 X is most likely the new iPad Pro. pic.twitter.com/eCz1gVvfkb ” Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) February 22, 2020 Prosser later said that Target employees also sent him likely placeholders for the new iPhone as well as the new iPad Pro, which is in line with the reports above. And as AppleInsider points out, such placeholders typically turn into actual products within a month, which roughly matches a potential March launch date. SEE ALSO: Report: Apple to unveil new, cheaper iPhone 'as early as March' While Apple's event is nearly certain at this point, there's some confusion on when it will actually happen.

Even though both the S&P 500 had its worst day in two years and the Dow went negative for the year, he's confident stocks will rebound. ""Build shopping lists of what you may have missed and regretted missing just a few weeks ago when the market was moving up every day,"" he said. ""Then, consider the price you want to buy at and that you feel comfortable with and consider how much fluctuation you can take because this will take a while to work out.""

It implies an 8% increase from Monday's close. This isn't the first time Stoltzfus reiterated his long-term bullish case during a tumultuous time in the market. On ""Trading Nation"" in early January, he gave similar advice when fears over Iran sparked the market's worst day in a month. ""This is not the dark ages. It's 21-century medicine,"" Stoltzfus said.

Tae Kim,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Chip Stocks Are Tumbling. Analyst Says Coronavirus Risk Is Growing.,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/chip-stocks-semiconductors-coronavirus-risk-51582561169?mod=hp_DAY_5,"Photograph by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images Semiconductor stocks have soared over the past year in anticipation of a rebound for the sector. But Instinet analyst David Wong says the market may be misjudging the potential negative effects from the coronavirus outbreak on the chip industry. On Monday, equity markets fell after reports of further coronavirus infections outside of China, including in South Korea, Italy, and Iran. While there has been a lot of attention on the supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, we think that many investors, and companies, may have underestimated the risk of the current issues impacting end market demand, Wong wrote in a note to clients Sunday. We remain cautious on the chip industry overall and selective in our chip and chip equipment stock picks. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, had risen more than 30% over the past year. On Monday, the ETF fell about 4%. The analyst noted how Analog Devices warned last week that the virus outbreak was affecting demand from its China-based industrial and automotive customers, while also slowing the rollout of 5G in China. Shares of chip makers Micron Technology (MU), Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all declined more than 4% Monday. Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com",business

The new updated guidance is 9% to 10% sales growth for the quarter. Mastercard shares were down 2.2% to $317.50 in post-market trading. In similar fashion, United Airlines is seeing lower consumer demand due to the virus outbreak.

Markets sank across the board on Friday, adding to a precipitous weekly sell-off, as investors punished risk assets after reports that the coronavirus continued to spread outside of China into the Middle East, Europe and North America. Even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points and the S&P 500 slid 4% on Friday alone, each index remained well above the thresholds required to impose what NYSE calls ""market-wide circuit breakers,"" a set of procedures the equities and options exchanges have at their disposal to halt cross-market trading. As of this writing, the Dow's week-to-date decline totaled 4,150 points, or 14.3%; the S&P was down a similar 14%. But the exchange doesn't take into account multi-session moves when assessing whether to halt. The goal of it is to ensure orderly trading on a daily basis. A cross-market trading halt can be triggered at three breaker thresholds that measure a decrease against the prior day's closing price of the S&P 500 index. To be sure, marketwide halts are rare and are usually associated with broader economic fears of recession. The last time the NYSE imposed a Level 1 halt occurred on Dec. 1, 2008, when the S&P 500 closed down 8.9% in one of the worst trading sessions of the last 15 years. The last time the S&P 500 fell more than 13% in a single session was on Oct. 19, 1987, when the market closed down more than 20% in a day now known on Wall Street as ""Black Monday."" Regulators overhauled trade-clearing protocols and introduced the circuit breakers after that dramatic fall, meaning that U.S. investors have never seen a Level 2 or Level 3 halt.

Thomas Franck@tomwfranck,2/24/2020,cnbc,"Buffett: Economy a bit softer, Berkshire business hit by coronavirus",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/warren-buffett-says-us-economy-is-strong-but-a-little-softer-than-it-was-6-months-ago.html,"Billionaire Warren Buffett said Monday that while the U.S. economy still looks healthy, it isn't as robust as it was even half a year ago thanks to headwinds like the Trump administration's trade war and the burgeoning coronavirus. ""It's strong, but a little softer than it was six months ago, but that's over a broad range,"" Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""You look at car holdings ”rail-car holdings, moving goods around. And there again, that was affected by the tariffs, too, because people front-ended purchases, all kinds of things."" ""Business is down but it's down from a very good level,"" added the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, speaking from the conglomerate's headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. The ""Oracle of Omaha"" said that the Trump administration's tit-for-tat trade war and, increasingly, the coronavirus threaten corporate America's bottom line. ""Tariffs ” the tariff situation was a big question mark for all kinds of companies. And still is to some degree. But that was front and center for a while. Now, coronavirus is front and center,"" he said. During the interview, Buffett pointed to several macroeconomic headwinds that when combined, appear to have weighed on U.S. growth over the last year. Fourth-quarter GDP growth in the U.S. was 2.1% and 2.3% for 2019, the slowest year of growth in three. That number is expected to slump further in the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of Boeing's 737 Max crisis and the impact of the novel coronavirus. Buffett said several Berkshire businesses were feeling an impact from the deadly virus, which has now spread beyond China and threatens to disrupt the global economy. ""We have maybe 1,000 Dairy Queen franchises in China ... [and] a great number of them are closed. But the ones that are open aren't doing any business to speak of,"" Buffett said. ""I'll guarantee you that a very significant percentage of our businesses one way are affected by it. But they're being affected by a lot of other things, too."" ""I mean our much bigger holding is Apple. We own 5.6% of Apple and the company came out and said that [the virus is] affecting not only its stores but all kinds of things, supply chains,"" he added. ""I find that a certain number of our companies have supply chain arrangements that are being affected by this."" Buffett's comments on Monday came amid reports that the coronavirus outbreak in countries outside China has worsened, especially South Korea and Italy, which reported a spike in the number of confirmed cases in recent days. South Korea raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"" over the weekend, with the latest spike in numbers bringing the total infected there to more than 750. Despite these worries, Buffett did say that he was a net buyer of stocks for the moment and that he still recommends buying equities over the long term.

After the major indexes declined more than 3% on concerns of the coronavirus spreading across continents, the ""Mad Money"" host pointed to consumer staples, pharmaceuticals and utilities as stand-out sectors. ""I wish I could be optimistic about more groups, but I don't think it's worth the risk for many of them,"" he said. Investors can consider adding defensive names like beverage giant Coca-Cola and Chips Ahoy-parent Mondelez International to their portfolios, Cramer said. Last month, Coca-Cola reported positive quarterly results on the backs of new product launches. Mondelez also topped analyst estimates in its fourth-quarter report. ""Their yields can save you, here,"" Cramer said. ""They're what you buy in a slowdown, and we're getting a slowdown."" Cramer suggested that drug stocks are ""looking good."" He has his eyes on Gilead Sciences in particular, which rallied about 4.6% Monday to almost $73 per share. The biotechnology company is reportedly testing a treatment ” antiviral remdesivir ” for the COVID-19 virus. Merck, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson shares traded lower during the session, with Eli Lilly taking a 2.7% hit. Cramer said he likes each of these stocks on weakness. Utilities stocks have been steady gainers within the first two months of 2020, especially with a global economic slowdown on investors' minds. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks stocks in the industry, is up 7.57% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 0.15% dip. Cramer recommended three utilities worth adding to the shopping list. Dominion Energy ""hasn't rallied as much as the others,"" he said. ""We've always liked American Electric Power and Con Ed. We're returning to those."" When it comes to gold, another safe-haven investment, the precious metal has ""more room to run"" on the market, the host said. Disclaimer Questions for Cramer?

Tyler Clifford@_TylerTheTyler_,2/24/2020,cnbc,Jim Cramer: Some stocks 'too toxic to touch' amid coronavirus sell-off,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/jim-cramer-some-stocks-too-toxic-to-touch-amid-coronavirus-sell-off.html,"Investors must take precaution about the stocks they want to put their money in because the coronavirus outbreak is disrupting supply chains of many companies, CNBC's Jim Cramer warned on Monday. American businesses are ""far too dependent"" on manufacturing products in China, he said. The comments came after the three major U.S. stock indexes plunged more than 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 1,031 points, suffering its biggest losses in two years. Known as COVID-19, the virus is believed to have originated in the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei province, where many factories are located. Wuhan remains under a mandatory quarantine. Fears about the coronavirus spreading outside China, including in South Korea and Italy, rattled the market. ""I need to emphasize, again, that the big risk from the coronavirus outbreak has to do with interrupted supply chains and a concomitant business slowdown worldwide,"" Cramer said. ""That means we have to be careful. You don't want to buy something that's about to have its supply lines cut."" Cramer spelled out groups of stocks that he thinks are ""too toxic to touch."" Apple shares tanked almost 5% on Monday. Share prices of America's most valuable company are down about 8% since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global health emergency. The tech giant, which assembles the majority of iPhones in China, warned last week that it may need to guide down its outlook for the March quarter. Cramer said Apple is still prone to downgrades by analysts. Apple's initial guidance for its second fiscal quarter forecast net sales to come in at $63 billion to $67 billion. ""Apple, to me, is a terrific company, terrific stock, but I can't recommend buying it at this very moment because I think [the stock] could have more downside. I think some analysts could turn against it,"" he said. ""I expect analysts to start downgrading the stock on supply-chain worries, not to mention lost Chinese business ” and that'll be your chance."" Apple's troubles this quarter would also bleed particularly into its semiconductor suppliers' earnings, said Cramer, pointing to Cirrus Logic, Skyworks Solutions, NXP Semiconductors and Qualcomm. ""Those are all in the blast zone and their stocks are not yet low enough to be worth picking at,"" he said. ""They all rallied after 'phase one' was agreed to in the trade war with China."" Cramer declared Monday's drain to be ""day one"" for the cruise industry. Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corp, the latter of which had a ship under mandatory quarantine in Japan, fell about 9%. The stocks are also down double digits form the day the WHO declared the public health matter a global emergency on Jan. 30. ""[Vacationers] do not want to be stuck on a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic. The [forecast] numbers have to come down,"" Cramer said. The casino stocks of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, which have exposure to China's gambling industry, are also in ""nightmarish"" territory, Cramer said. He highlighted Penn National, however, as an enticing stock to pick up as a domestic and sports gambling play in the wake of a sports betting tie-up with Barstool Sports. Airlines are also prone to more estimate cuts, due to an expected decline in international travel as the novel virus spreads beyond China. The looming estimate cuts will take those stocks lower, Cramer said. U.S. carriers have suspended flights to China and Hong Kong. With more cases showing up in South Korea, Iran and Italy, the industry may face more headwinds. ""I wouldn't touch a hotel name here, especially the hotels with lots of exposure to China or Chinese tourists,"" Cramer said. ""Those all need to be sold even with their stocks already down a great deal."" Bank stocks are tough to own in a sell-off, especially with the state of the bond market as a backdrop, Cramer said. Investors often ditch the riskier stock asset class in a sell-off in favor of safer investments like government bonds, whose yields move inversely to prices. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF, or KBE, which traces financial stocks, slid more than 3% Monday. Longer-term interest rates fell by about 10 basis points with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching its lowest point in nearly four years and the 30-year Treasury hitting a record low. ""Long-term interest rates are plummeting, which means the banks will have to once again rely very heavily on fee-based revenue. They can't make that much on loans [when interest rates are low]. I'm betting the numbers need to be cut ” number cuts mean sell."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple Disclaimer Questions for Cramer?

Weizhen Tan@weizent,2/24/2020,cnbc,"Coronavirus: China's air pollution levels, smog show hit to the economy",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/coronavirus-chinas-air-pollution-levels-smog-show-hit-to-the-economy.html,"All eyes are on China's progress in getting its factories to crank up again, after the country extended this year's Lunar New Year holiday and shut down major growth regions in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Many of its provinces started gradually limping back to some form of production last week, about two weeks later than previous years. The Chinese government has also been giving regular updates, reporting last Wednesday that work resumption rate has topped 50% for some industrial companies in key economic regions such as Guangdong and Shanghai. Chinese state media also reported Tuesday that more than 80% of its central state-owned companies' roughly 20,000 manufacturing subsidiaries have resumed work. But here's how some economists and analysts are tracking the story of China's progress in returning to work ” as the world's second largest economy gears up to return to full production. Analysts are using pollution levels as a gauge of industrial activity. Major cities in China are well known for being choked by smog, due to the extensive burning of coal by factories. So far this year, pollution levels have been between 20% and 25% lower compared to the same period last year, Tapas Strickland of National Australia Bank (NAB) said in a note earlier last week, suggesting there was a substantial decline in industrial activity in the first quarter.  Referring to the official update that more than 80% of China's 20,000 manufacturing subsidies have resumed work, Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at NAB, cast doubt on the actual progress. ""This news should have been embraced warmly by the market, however high frequency data such as pollution levels and traffic congestion gauges in Beijing do not at this stage corroborate the upbeat official message, keeping investors wary,"" he said in a note Wednesday. On Feb. 20 (Thursday), daily coal consumption of six major power plants was 42.5% less than the same time last year, according to Nomura, which has been tracking such metrics daily. The Japanese bank has also been following data on traffic congestion, passenger flows and new home sales in a bid to track the progress of China's work resumption. ""The pace was slow due to a lack of workers and strict reopening criteria, and it varied across cities, industries, and firms,"" J.P. Morgan's Sin Beng Ong wrote in a note last week. ""The weak resumption of production is reinforced by a set of high-frequency indicators in the areas of energy consumption, real estate transactions, passenger traffic, and air quality,"" he said. Other metrics ” such as traffic congestion and passenger numbers ” could also shed some clues on the full picture of China's return to work. Analysts typically look at the Baidu Migration Index, which tracks the number of workers returning from their hometowns to work after the Lunar New Year (LNY) holiday. ""The Baidu migration index suggests that only 37% and 33% of people that left tier-1 and key tier-2 cities for LNY have returned (vs. 100% at this point last year),"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last week. large According to Nomura, the worker return rate for 15 cities was 25.6% as of Feb. 19, only around a quarter of what was recorded a year ago. However, Oxford Economics pointed out in a note on Thursday that such gauges do not completely reflect the full back-to-work progress, as they don't take into account the practice of working from home amid the virus crisis. ""Pollution and traffic volume statistics provide one guide to the speed at which China is returning to business as usual,"" the advisory firm said. ""But they're imprecise indicators of activity growth and will fail to fully capture shifts in spending and activity (e.g., greater online spending and remote working),"" it said, adding that the first gauge will ""come from the business surveys of sentiment.""",finance
William Feuer@WillFOIA,2/24/2020,cnbc,WHO says it's too early to declare a coronavirus pandemic: 'Now is the time to prepare',https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/who-says-its-too-early-to-declare-a-coronavirus-pandemic-now-is-the-time-to-prepare.html,"As cases of the new coronavirus surge outside of China, world health officials said Monday that other countries should start preparing for epidemic outbreaks of COVID-19 to cross their borders. ""It is time to do everything you would do in preparing for a pandemic,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, told reporters at a news briefing at the organization's headquarters in Geneva. ""In declaring something a pandemic, it is too early. We're still trying to avoid that eventuality."" In the past week, the virus has spread substantially outside of China. In Italy, the virus has infected more than 220 people and killed at least seven as of Monday morning. South Korea confirmed another 231 cases on Monday, which brings the total in the country to more than 830. And health officials in Iran have confirmed 61 total cases in the country, with 12 deaths nationwide. The localized outbreaks outside of China are fueling concerns among infectious disease experts and scientists that the virus has become a pandemic. However, WHO officials declined to declare it as one on Monday, saying that it is still too early to say. ""Pandemos is a concept where there's a belief that the whole world's population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick and we've seen that in influenza,"" Ryan said, citing the Greek root of the word pandemic. He said influenza pandemics can be called much earlier and easier because they know how that virus spreads. World health officials don't entirely understand how COVID-19 spreads, Ryan said, but the fact that new cases in China have dropped ""goes against the logic of pandemic."" A WHO-led team just concluded a research trip to several provinces in China, including the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan in Hubei province. WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the team reported that cases ""peaked and plateaued"" between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and have been ""declining steadily since then."" ""Yet we see, in contrast to that, an acceleration of cases in places like Korea and therefore we're still in the balance,"" Ryan said. Globally, the outbreak has now infected more than 79,400 and killed at least 2,600 so far. ""If we're not using the P-word now, we'll be using it in the days or weeks to come,"" Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of Toronto, said in a phone interview with CNBC. The data from China indeed shows a peak and decline, he added, but there are questions about the reliability of that data. On Sunday, Chinese President Xi Jinping called the outbreak a major public health emergency with ""the fastest spread, the widest range of infections, and the most difficult prevention and control in China"" since the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to state media. Outside China, there are now 2,074 cases in 28 countries, including 23 deaths, Tedros said. He said the sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea is ""deeply concerning."" ""Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet,"" Tedros said. ""This is not the time to focus on what word we use. That will not prevent a single infection today or save a single life today.""

William Watts,2/24/2020,marketwatch,Stock-market rout triggers scramble for safe havens ” in charts,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-treasury-prices-soar-as-coronavirus-fears-spark-global-stock-market-selloff-and-a-flight-to-safety-2020-02-24?mod=article_inline,"A global flight to safety took hold Monday, pushing up traditional havens including gold and Treasurys, as stocks and other assets viewed as risky sold off sharply on fears the spread of COVID-19 outside of China could dent the global economy. Coronavirus update: 79,339 cases, 2,169 deaths, clusters emerge in Iran and Italy The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.64% fell more than 1,000 points , or 3.6%,  while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.36% dropped 3.4%. Both indexes turned negative for the year, while joining a global equity rout that saw heavy losses for Asian and European stocks. Need to Know: Warren Buffett says don't buy or sell' on the headlines as coronavirus sends stocks plunging Other assets perceived as risky also saw heavy selling , with the U.S. oil benchmark US:CLJ20 and Brent crude UK:BRNK20 , the global benchmark, each dropping more than 3%. It's a quintessential risk off' day today, with gold and other haven assets soaring, said Marshall Gittler, analyst at BDSwiss Group, in a note. Gold US:GCJ20 was up $27.70, or 1.7%, at $1,676.50 an ounce, adding to haven-fueled gains that took the yellow metal to more-than-seven-year highs at the end of last week. Investors also piled into Treasurys, sending yields, which trade in the opposite direction of price, falling sharply. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.724% dropped more than 9 basis points to 1.377%, closing in on an all-time low set in 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 8.1 basis points to 1.836%, extending a decline that last week took the long bond to an all-time low. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.193% , which is more sensitive to rate-cut expectations, dropped 8.2 basis points to 1.266%. Analysts warned that knee-jerk reactions can be overdone, but also noted that sentiment around the spread of the viral outbreak is driving trade across markets at present and is likely to continue to dominate price action at least in the near future. It's difficult to imagine a scenario with a compelling all clear' on the COVID-19 virus in the near term, but things can/will get much worse before getting better. That asymmetry will govern trading conditions this week and makes it difficult to sustain any cheapening in safe-havens, said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a Monday note. Read: Economists say Fed rate cut could come as early as March Action in currencies was relatively calm, with the U.S. dollar largely holding its own, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.08% , a measure of the U.S. currency against six major rivals, was little changed near 99.277. The index traded at a nearly three-year high last week before giving up a modest amount of ground. Read: Can stocks keep soaring as the U.S. dollar surges? What investors need to know The Swiss franc, which has a long-lived reputation as a haven during periods of financial market turmoil, added to recent gains to edge to a more-than-four-year high versus the euro EURCHF, -0.02% . The shared eurozone currency, meanwhile, had taken a hit as the spread of the coronavirus in Italy sent the country's benchmark stock index I945, -0.20% down more than 4% and pushed Italian yields higher as investors sold government paper. The euro EURUSD, -0.01% , however, was up 0.1% in recent action versus the dollar at $1.0854. See: Here's a reminder that when the dollar moves, things break' ” and vice versa Analysts said the Japanese yen has seen its haven-related luster suffer in part due to fears about country's proximity to China and perceived increased vulnerability to an economic hit from the spread of COVID-19. The yen did find some support Monday, however, with the U.S. dollar USDJPY, -0.25% falling 0.7% to Β¥110.77. The dollar remains up more than 2% versus the yen so far in February, however. Meanwhile, the interplay between havens and other assets also remains crucial. Gains for gold, for example, are likely driven in part by expectations that central bankers will move to further cut interest rates, pressing down yields of U.S. Treasury and so-called core European government bonds. Low or in some cases negative, bond yields reduce or remove the opportunity cost of holding a nonyielding asset like gold. Gold is no doubt rising in anticipation of further declines in interest rates as central banks apply what monetary medicine they can to economies hit by the COVID-19 virus, Gittler wrote. The fact that the U.S. long bond started trading with a 1-handle again last week shows how this assumption is permeating markets. It's likely to boost gold further, in my view.",business
Xin Xu,2/24/2020,theconversation,The hunt for a coronavirus cure is showing how science can change for the better,https://www.theconversation.com/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-cure-is-showing-how-science-can-change-for-the-better-132130,"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared an international public health emergency over the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus. One day later, the Wellcome Trust research charity called for researchers, journals and funders around the world to share research data and findings relevant to the coronavirus rapidly and openly, to inform the public and help save lives.  On the same day, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure launched a free website and called for scientists to publish research on the coronavirus with open access. Shortly after, the prominent scientific journal Nature issued an editorial urging all coronavirus researchers to keep sharing, stay open. So while cities are locked down and borders are closed in response to the coronavirus outbreak, science is becoming more open. This openness is already making a difference to scientists' response to the virus and has the potential to change the world. But it's not as simple as making every research finding available to anyone for any purpose. Without care and responsibility, there is a danger that open science can be misused or contribute to the spread of misinformation. Open science can come in a variety of forms, including open data, open publications and open educational resources. DNA sequencing is of great importance to developing specific diagnostic kits around the world. Yong-Zhen Zhang and his colleagues from Fudan University in Shanghai were the first to sequence the DNA of the novel coronavirus. They placed the gene sequence in GenBank, an open-access data repository. Researchers around the world immediately started analysing it to develop diagnostics.  As of February 19 2020, 81 different coronavirus gene sequences had been shared openly via GenBank and 189 via the China National Genomics Data Centre. They provide the data that will allow scientists to decode the mystery of the virus and hopefully find a treatment or vaccine.  The WHO and national organisations like the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also publish open statistical data, such as the number of patients. This can help researchers to map the spread of the virus and offer the public up-to-date and transparent information. Science publications are costly. One of the most expensive Elsevier journals, Tetrahedron Letters, costs Β£16,382 for an institutional annual subscription and Β£673 for a personal one. Even the University of Harvard cannot afford to subscribe to all journals. This means not all researchers have access to all subscription-based publications.  Authors can publish their articles free to access, which often means they need to pay the publishers an average Β£2,000 in article processing costs. In 2018, only 36.2% of science publications were open-access. As of February 18 2020, there were 500 scientific articles about the novel coronavirus in the comprehensive scholarly database Dimensions. Only 160 (32%) of them were in open-access publications. This includes preprint servers such as bioRxiv and arXiv, which are widely used open-access archives to publish research before it goes through scientific peer review.  Normally, you would need to pay subscription fees to read any of the other 340 articles. However, articles published by the 100 companies who have signed the Wellcome Trust's statement on sharing coronavirus research have been made freely accessible by publishers.  Major publishers including Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, Oxford University Press and Wanfang have also set up featured open-access resources page. The Chinese database CQVIP has offered free access to all of its 14,000 journals during the coronavirus outbreak. As it takes on average 160 days for a preprint to be published after peer review, sharing preprints can save time and save life. Free access to articles on the coronavirus can also accelerate global research on this subject.  Due to the outbreak, universities in China have postponed their new semesters and switched to online learning. But alongside the 24,000 online courses open to students, universities (including the elite Peking University, Tsinghua University and Xi'an Jiaotong University) are offering free online courses to the public about the coronavirus. Such courses can offer the public reliable information grounded in academic research, helping them better understand and protect themselves against the virus.  While all these developments are positive, it is important to remember that open science doesn't mean science without limits. It must be used responsibly by researchers and the public. To start, researchers need to have mutual respect for the integrity of their work. For example, there have reportedly already been disagreements over whether scientists need to request consent to reuse pre-publication data from shared coronavirus gene sequencing. Assuming researchers act in good faith and not to simply further their own careers, it is still important for them to clarify the conditions with which they make their research available, and to carefully check and follow such conditions when using other people's data. Responsible uses of pre-publication data are vital to fostering a scientific culture that encourages transparent and explicit cooperation. There are also issues with making research available without peer review - as happens with preprint servers - as misinterpretations and mistakes can easily happen. One paper posted on bioRxiv on February 2 2020 claimed to show insertions in the coronavirus's DNA that showed an uncanny similarity to regions found in HIV DNA. After criticism of the their work, the paper's authors withdrew it stating they did not intend to feed into the conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus had been deliberately engineered. Such conspiracy theories were recently condemned by 27 scientists from eight countries in their open statement to the leading medical journal The Lancet. Yet until February 19 2020, the withdrawn paper was the most discussed study in the world in online news and social media, according to the academic ranking site Altmetric. The paper may have been withdrawn but it won't have been forgotten.  Open science is vital to tackling the world's big challenges. But when information can be misused, skewed or misinterpreted at global level so quickly, we also need scientists and the public to treat open science with great care and responsibility.",business

""We believe it is too early to call an end to the market turmoil arising from the COVID-19 outbreak,"" analysts from BNP Paribas, France's largest bank, wrote in a Friday report. The new coronavirus, believed to have first emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, was recently named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. The bank said that while ""the true extent of the stress on the Chinese economy is just beginning to emerge,"" the degree to which China is economically linked with the rest of Asia means that ""all the Asian markets could suffer ” some more, some less."" Sectors such as travel and tourism, consumer discretionary and manufacturing that's dependent on production input from China were the ""obvious losers"" of the coronavirus epidemic, the analysts said in the report. But that doesn't mean investors should avoid buying Asian stocks now. As more consumers choose to stay home, online retail players stand to benefit, said BNP Paribas. In addition, some Asian economies are less exposed to the potential economic fallout in China ” that makes them a safe market to invest in now, the analysts said, adding that ""India is the first one that comes to mind."" Here are the sectors and stocks that BNP Paribas identified as safe to invest in now: When concerns surrounding COVID-19 ease, some sectors most impacted by the outbreak could bounce back sharply, according to the bank. ""We expect the Chinese consumption to recover rapidly. Tourism might not, as changes in consumer behaviour, especially where such behaviour could potentially expose one to infection, could be much more long drawn out,"" the analysts said. They added that as manufacturers in China resume operations, concerns about output disruptions would ""rapidly diminish."" That's good news for economies and regional companies that are closely tied to China's production, they said. These are the sectors and stocks that BNP Paribas said could bounce back: The BNP report was released on Friday, before South Korea raised the alert on the disease to its highest level on the weekend. The number of cases on Friday morning was 204 ” it tripled to 763 on Monday morning.",finance
Yomi Kazeem,2/24/2020,qz,Nigeria's economy has best quarterly growth since recession ” Quartz,https://www.qz.com/africa/1807355/nigerias-economy-has-best-quarterly-growth-since-recession/,"Since suffering a recession and full year of negative growth in 2016, Nigeria, Africa's largest economy has recovered”slowly. Data from Nigeria's statistics bureau shows the pace of recovery remains slow despite noting a milestone: gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.55%”the highest quarterly growth rate since the 2016 recession. Overall, Nigeria's economy grew 2.27% in 2019, slightly higher than it did in the preceding year. And, as is often the case, Nigeria's economic growth was anchored on its oil exports with production levels remaining stable throughout 2019. But while being its recent best performance, the economic growth rate remains short of the government's projections. The government's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (EGRP), launched in the aftermath of the recession, was anchored on aggressive growth from 2017 to 2020 in a bid to turn the economic slump around. But the latest data confirms Nigeria's economy fell short of the EGRP's projected GDP growth rate of 4.5% in 2019. In fact, most EGRP projections have been off the mark. For instance, Nigeria's unemployment rate is nearly double the EGRP's projected 12% target. While government's spin will likely focus on the reality of the economy's best quarterly performance since the recession, a more nuanced view is that the growth is simply not happening as urgently as the country's challenges and population growth requires. The challenge from the policy environment is that the economy will continue to be sluggish”this 2.55% [growth rate] is a continuation of that sluggishness, says Nonso Obikili, a Lagos-based economist. Looking forward Nigeria is forecasting economic growth of 7%, but most observers will find that estimate over-optimistic. In January the IMF forecast economic growth of 2.5% in 2020 and in 2021. This would be below sub-Saharan Africa's average growth rate of 3.5% in both years. The dampening news for Nigeria is that as much policymakers try to encourage the diversification of the economy the country is still heavily reliant of oil export earnings. This means its fragile economic growth can be abruptly reversed if oil prices drop. This outcome is now a very real possibility amid the coronavirus outbreak in China hitting the global economy and pushing oil prices lower than Nigeria's budgetary benchmark of $57 per barrel. In its analysis of the outbreak's potential economic impact on Nigeria, SBM Intel, a Lagos intelligence firm, says Nigeria is at risk of another recession given its over reliance on oil sector proceeds. If oil demand continues to fall with no OPEC intervention in the form of production cuts, tightening supply, a country like Nigeria will be negatively impacted by the downward price trend, it says.

The bank slashed its U.S. GDP growth forecast to just 1.2% from 1.4%, seeing a more severe drag from the epidemic. That growth rate is drastically slower than the 2.1% increase in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year 2019. ""The risks are clearly skewed to the downside until the outbreak is contained,"" Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief U.S. economist, said in a note on Monday. ""An increasing amount of companies [are] suggesting potential production cuts should supply chain disruptions persist into Q2 or later."" The number of coronavirus cases outside China surged recently, stoking fears of a prolonged global economic slowdown from the virus spreading. Stocks suffered a steep sell-off on Monday, with the Dow dropping 800 points and erasing its gains on the year. South Korea raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"" over the weekend, with the latest spike in numbers bringing the total infected to more than 750 ” making it the country with the most cases outside mainland China. Meanwhile, outside of Asia, Italy has been the worst affected country so far, with more than 130 reported cases and three deaths. To be sure, Goldman still expects ""a negligible hit"" to U.S. overall activity from supply chain production disruptions because there seems to be ample inventory to power manufacturing for a while. ""Lower production outside of China due to supply chain disruptions has remained negligible thus far, and that most sectors have enough inventory to continue production as normal until at least Q2,"" Hatzius said. Goldman does see some of the activity lost coming back in the second quarter if the virus is contained. The firm expects second-quarter U.S. GDP to tally 2.7%.

Agence France-Presse,2/23/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: woman on Diamond Princess cruise ship tested positive after disembarking,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/coronavirus-woman-on-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-tested-positive-after-disembarking,"Japan has confirmed that a woman who tested negative and left the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship later tested positive, raising more questions about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. The health minister, Katsunobu Kato, apologised after 23 passengers were allowed to leave the ship without being properly tested and vowed to have people retested. The woman in her 60s returned home to the Tochigi prefecture north of Tokyo by train on Wednesday, but she had a fever on Friday and tested positive on Saturday, a local official said. She was the first passenger to have tested positive in Japan after having been cleared to disembark. Infectious disease experts and local officials have questioned how effective the quarantine period on the vessel was. There has been a judgment that those who disembarked after testing negative had no problem, but it has now become clear that those people can turn positive, Tochigi's governor, Tomokazu Fukuda, said on Saturday. We call on the government to take additional measures. Health minister Katsunobu Kato told a news conference in Tokyo on Saturday that the ministry was trying to reach the 23 passengers for retesting. We deeply apologise for the situation caused by our oversight, Kato said. We will take all necessary measures, like double checks, to prevent a recurrence. Japanese authorities said they decided to allow passengers who tested negative during the quarantine period to disembark as they had taken measures to prevent the virus spreading: passengers were confined to their cabins, except for brief outings on open deck when they had to wear gloves and masks and keep their distance from fellow passengers. However, an infectious diseases specialist from Kobe University, Prof Kentaro Iwata, has said the situation on the ship was completely chaotic and violated quarantine procedures, in blunt criticism rarely seen in Japanese officialdom. He later said he had heard from a colleague on board that quarantine procedures had improved, but he still recommended that all those disembarking should be monitored for at least 14 days and should avoid contact with others. Since Wednesday about 970 passengers “ who tested negative after the government put the ship under quarantine on 5 February “ have disembarked, local media reported. On Saturday about 100 more passengers who had reportedly been in close contact with infected people on board were allowed to get off. They included the last group of Japanese passengers, while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for their governments to send chartered aircraft. With the latest disembarkation, a 14-day quarantine is expected to start for more than 1,000 crew still on board. Many of them were not placed in isolation as they were needed to prepare food and deliver meals to cabins. Critics have said that they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which had more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly Covid-19 disease. Kato defended Japan's on-board quarantine on Saturday saying there was no medical facility large enough to admit more than 3,000 people at once.",general
Anisha Sircar,2/23/2020,qz,Coronavirus evacuees in Kashmir face worse lockdown than in China ” Quartz India,https://www.qz.com/india/1806649/coronavirus-evacuees-in-kashmir-face-worse-lockdown-than-in-china/,"Aspiring doctors from India's troubled region have increasingly been moving to China. Now, they face a unique predicament of staying in China, where there is an ongoing battle against the Covid-19 coronavirus, and going back to India”which, for them, signals a different, and more time-honored, kind of danger. As the outbreak spread in China, cities were shut down, and foreign students were bombarded with messages from their families urging them to go home. But for Kashmiris, back home means returning to a communication blackout, a crippling curfew, reports of violence and torture by the Indian army, and the political turmoil that has been sweeping through the disputed state for decades. On Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, two Air India flights evacuated nearly 650 Indians out of Wuhan. Dozens of those evacuated were young Kashmiris studying at Hubei University of Medicine. After leaving the region at the epicentre of the influenza-like disease, many remained conflicted about what to do, given the situation in their home state. We have come home, but there is another situation now, which is the communication blackout in Kashmir, said Saleem, an evacuee from Anantnag, Kashmir, at the ITBP facility in Delhi. (His name has been changed for safety reasons.) I will probably drop off in the next few minutes, he said, a few seconds before losing his internet connection, enabled by a VPN. Kashmiri students didn't think much of the virus when it first hit China while they were studying at Hubei University of Medicine. Among them was Sanee (name also changed), a 22-year-old MBBS student from Lethpora, Pulwama. When he heard of the virus in early December, he and his friends thought it was some kind of pneumonia that would pass in a few days, and decided to stay on at the university. But on Jan. 23, when the Chinese government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities, he realized things were getting worse. Back home in Lethpora, his parents were getting anxious. They wanted me to return home at any cost, he said. His university, located in Shiyan, has nearly 150 Indian students, he said. Suddenly desperate to go home, they contacted the Indian embassy in China on Jan. 26, requesting evacuation. Two days later, they reached out to Raveesh Kumar, spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs. Our senior, Shoaib Mushtaq, didn't get a direct response from the embassy, so he said, Let me directly call Raveesh Kumar', said Mansoor Ahmed, another Kashmiri evacuee from Srinagar, in his third year. Mushtaq found Kumar's number through a Google search, and reportedly called him directly. When Kumar picked up the phone, everybody in the room was shocked. He told Raveesh Kumar, Sir, I'm Shoaib from Hubei University of Medicine. We called the Indian embassy, they told us they would help, but they're not responding now.' Raveesh asked Shoaib, Why are they not responding?' He gave us a number, which my friend immediately called. They were asked to prepare a list of all their names, numbers, email addresses, and passport details and send them to the embassy individually. On Feb. 1, Sanee, Ahmed, Shoaib, and other students were evacuated from Hubei University of Medicine by bus. They reached Wuhan, took a few tests, and then boarded an airplane. They arrived in Delhi on the morning of Feb. 2 and were taken to the Chhawla ITBP center for quarantine. Videos from the quarantined facility show masked people buried in textbooks and getting routinely tested for infections by medical professionals in suits. It was like Big Boss, said Ahmed. There were speakers everywhere, we were given serial numbers, and mine was 250. In the mornings they would say from 1-100, please come downstairs,' and doctors would be waiting for a checkup. That was every morning. So we're now used to waking up, doing a check, and then going back to sleep. Our parents are not allowed to meet us, said Sanee while under quarantine, adding that life in the center was mundane, and they couldn't stop wishing they could see their families. Two weeks later, they were released with around 600 other Indians and seven Maldivians, each with a certificate affirming they didn't have the virus. Nobody in the group had tested positive. How did they feel? We can't explain in words, Sanee said. But there's another situation they're facing now. On Aug. 5, the Indian government imposed a communication shutdown in Jammu and Kashmir, in what became known as the world's longest internet shutdown in a democratic country. The ban came after the Narendra Modi-led BJP government revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomous status, after which, in anticipation of unrest in the disputed state, authorities suspended landline and mobile connections, cut off the internet, and deployed thousands of troops to the region. Months after imposing the blackout, some websites were unblocked, and internet restrictions eased. But the police have reportedly been filing FIRs against those who are finding ways to access Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media apps that are not listed under the 301 white-listed websites. Kashmiri students are struggling to contact their friends and study without the internet”the rest of their semester at Hubei University of Medicine is slated to be completed online. Life was great in China, said Saleem, who is in the fourth year of his medical programme. It's a great nation, with great people. Studying there was my dream. When I got the opportunity, I went for it. Studying online has not been easy. I hardly get a connection for over a few minutes a day here because most sites are banned by the government, he said. You can imagine my situation here [in Anantnag]. Saleem and Sanee are part of a small but significant wave of Kashmiri students who have been moving to China to study medicine over the last few years. According to The Counselor Education, a popular consultancy in Srinagar, and Baramulla-based Kasmiri Education Service, the number of young Kashmiris looking to study in China has risen steadily over the years, most of them aiming to pursue medicine. A degree is a degree. Whether it is an MBBS from Oxford or an MBBS from China, that doesn't matter for parents. Kashmiris want to make their children doctors, said Tasaduq Bazaz, associate director at The Counselor Education. Bazaz's agency is run by Nomaan Bazaz, an engineering graduate from Hertfordshire University, whose vision was to come back to India after graduating in 2013 to help other students of Jammu and Kashmir who wanted to study abroad. Since most such students are from middle-class or upper-middle-class backgrounds, they reportedly prefer countries like China, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, which offer affordable medical programmes with several scholarships. Bazaz said that Bangladesh was also a popular choice, but recently, universities there started making it expensive especially for Kashmiris, he said, and many visas have stopped being doled out to people from the Valley. It used to be around Rs10,00,000 to study medicine in Bangladesh, but it now costs over Rs30,00,000, pulling Kashmiris to China, which is far cheaper, even more, said Bazaz. The Counselor Education helped its first group of 20 boys to China in 2013. As there was not a single complaint from students in China nor their parents, that number moved up to 50 in 2014 and over 75 last year. A combination of the infrastructure in China, the promise of development, affordable tuition”including generous scholarships from Chinese universities, offering up to 100% paid, said Bazaz”and safety have been luring Kashmiris there. China is cheap for us, and we feel much safer there than we do in India, said Sanee. My parents didn't allow me to study in any other Indian states. But the plan isn't to stay on for long”the to-be doctors want to come back and practice in either India or Kashmir. I am waiting for the day that I can serve the people of my motherland, but with the situation right now, that seems impossible, said Saleem. Now, with the coronavirus outbreak, things may get even more complicated. The virus has taken an ugly toll on businesses, trade, and education choices in Kashmir, said Muhammad Ali, a spokesperson for Kashmir Education Service. Now, people would rather stay here. Parents have been worried about the children who just returned to Srinagar from quarantine under Delhi's ITBP facility, said Bazaz. Everybody is going to start taking precautions since it concerns their children's health, and as the fatalities of coronavirus keep rising. A new country may become the destination of choice for aspiring Kashmiri doctors. People are scared and, if this situation in China persists, they'll start going to places like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan starting 2020, said Bazaz. Still, China is offering a respite that conflict-ridden home states never could”in more ways than one. I'm happy I'm finally going home, said Sanee, while exiting quarantine on Feb. 19. But on the other hand, I won't be able to attend online classes because of the internet issues in Kashmir. Army personnel routinely check citizens' phones in Kashmir. When they find they have VPNs, they use physical violence or arrests, said Sanee. But without a VPN, I can't connect with anyone, nor can I finish my semester, he added. Ahmed, who was released from quarantine a few days ago, is waiting in Delhi for things to get better before he can go home to Srinagar. When I go around on my bike in Srinagar, the police come and check me at random. There's no privacy. It's like you're in a dictatorship. They'll say, give me your phone.' Why should I give you my phone? Ahmed remembers the summer he was home when Article 370 was revoked. His mother had to go through an ultrasonography after the curfew hours in the state. She was on the back of my bike, but [the police] didn't allow us to go. They said go back, and that was it. If we argued, they would beat us. Who's around to say anything? If they beat us, nobody would've known, and even if they did, nobody would have saved us. Luckily, he said, his advisors at Hubei are understanding about the situation in Kashmir. After 370 was revoked, and students from the state were taking longer than other students to return to university after their summer break, they made academic concessions for students' attendance and grades. And now, they are agreeing not to cut their marks for this semester, and have sent them PowerPoint presentations in advance to work around the internet ban in effect. China is the safest country for any person, from anywhere, no matter what the religion, Ahmed believes. For anybody in the world, no matter who you are, it's the safest place I've ever seen. Still, he and several Kashmiris say they want to go back home to Kashmir after graduating and serve their people, and can't imagine working anywhere else in the world. I'll just have download like 20-30 VPNs, maybe that will work? said Ahmed.",tech
Annalisa Merelli,2/23/2020,qz,Trump's fury over Covid-19 patient repatriation may be justified ” Quartz,https://www.qz.com/1807009/trumps-fury-over-coronavirus-patients-being-repatriated-may-be-justified/,"The 328 American patients who had been quarantined onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan flew home on Feb. 18. Amongst them were 14 people who were known to be infected with the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. More hadn't been diagnosed yet. The patients tested positive after the arrangements for their repatriation had been made as part of the group. That prompted a heated debate between the State Department, wanting to go ahead with the repatriation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommended against it. The State Department got its way. Reportedly, Donald Trump had not been informed that the protocol would be respected and people evacuated despite testing positive, and was furious that such a decision was made. The US president has never made a secret of being a germaphobe. Neither Trump nor the White House have publicly commented on the repatriation. It's a departure from Trump's past behavior: Notably, when in 2014 the US dealt with the repatriation of health workers who had contracted Ebola while treating people in West Africa, he was adamant they should not be brought back to the country. At the time, he had called for shutting down borders and keeping the health officials out of the country, warning that people who go to far away places to help out are great”but must suffer the consequences! He had also advocated refusing visa applications from Ebola-hit countries. This time, however, there may be some ground to the president's worries. The way the evacuation was conducted seems to point more to a rushed addressing of the discontent of the passengers (who had been kept in very uncomfortable conditions on the ship) than due diligence. Anne Schuchat, the CDC executive who passionately advised against the repatriation, thought the safer course of action would have been keeping the infected people in Japan, as it had initially been considered for the whole group of US passengers onboard the cruise ship. The State Department, on the other hand, trusted the precautions put in place on the plane, and considered the journey back to the US safe: The infected passengers would be separated in an enclosure in the plane. The CDC's concern was shared by infectious disease experts, but the Department of Health and Human Services supported the State Department. Eventually, all passengers boarded the plane and were flown to the US. The CDC said it wished to be left out from official communications on the decision, for fear of raising more concerns with its position against it. Curiously, it was Trump's people from the State and Health departments who made the decision that Trump later considered reckless”a move that raised concerns amongst experts that the administration may not be prepared to handle a health emergency. More test results on the people repatriated have come back positive since they reached the US. That suggests that even if the 14 people were cordoned off in the plane, there were others traveling with healthy passengers who had been infected. The passengers will all be in quarantine for 14 days in the US, between military bases and treatment centers.",tech
Associated Press,2/23/2020,marketwatch,Venice's famed pre-Lenten Carnival canceled to stem spread of coronavirus,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/venices-famed-pre-lenten-carnival-canceled-to-stem-spread-of-coronavirus-2020-02-23?mod=article_inline,"CODOGNO, Italy ” Italy scrambled Sunday to check the spread of Europe's first major outbreak of the new viral disease amid rapidly rising numbers of infections and a third death, calling off the popular Venice Carnival, scrapping major league soccer matches in the stricken area and shuttering theaters, including Milan's legendary La Scala. Concern was also on the rise in neighboring Austria, which halted all rail traffic to and from Italy for several hours after suspicion that a train at its southern border with Italy had two passengers possibly infected with the virus on board, authorities said. Austria's interior ministry said it had been informed by Italy's railway company that two passengers had fever and stopped the train at the Brenner crossing before it could enter Austria. However, just before midnight Austria's Federal Railways announced on Twitter the ban had been lifted. Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the two people suspected of being infected with the virus on the Eurocity 86 train from Venice to Munich had tested negative and the train would be allowed to continue on its way, according to the ORF broadcast network. The decision to call off Venice Carnival was announced by Veneto regional Gov. Luca Zaia as the number of confirmed virus cases soared to 152, the largest number outside Asia. The ordinance is immediately operative and will go into effect at midnight,'' said Zaia, whose area includes Venice, where thousands packed St. Mark's Square. Carnival would have run through Tuesday. Road blocks were set up in at least some of 10 towns in Lombardy at the epicenter of the outbreak, including in Casalpusterlengo, to keep people from leaving or arriving. Even trains transiting the area weren't allowed to stop. Buses, trains and other forms of public transport ” including boats in Venice ” were being disinfected, Zaia told reporters. Museums were also ordered to shut down after Sunday in Venice, a top tourist draw anytime of the year, as well as in neighboring Lombardy, which, with at least 110 confirmed cases, is the epicenter of the viral outbreak. Authorities said three people in Venice have tested positive for the viral disease known as COVID-19, all of them in their late 80s and who were hospitalized in critical condition. Other northern regions with smaller numbers of cases are Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont. Italy's first two cases were a Chinese tourist couple, diagnosed earlier this month and reported recovering in a Rome hospital. The death on Sunday of an elderly woman, who was already suffering from cancer when she contracted the virus, raised the nation's death toll to three, said Lombardy regional official Giulio Gallera. Authorities expressed frustration that they haven't been able to track down the source of the virus that is spreading in the north and which surfaced last week when an Italian man in his late 30s in Codogno became critically ill. The health officials haven't been yet able to pinpoint patient zero,' Angelo Borrelli, head of the national Civil Protection agency, told reporters in Rome. At first, it was widely presumed that the man was infected by an Italian friend he dined with and who had recently returned from his job, based in Shanghai. But when the friend tested negative for the virus attention turned to several Chinese residents who frequent the same cafe visited by the stricken man. But Lombardy Gov. Attilio Fontana told reporters they all tested negative too. So for now, Borrelli indicated the strategy is to concentrate on closures and other restrictions to try to stem the spread in the country, which already had taken measures early on in the global virus alarm that included banning direct flights from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Italy has also tested millions of airport passengers arriving from other places for any signs of fever. Worry is understandable, panic, no,'' Premier Giuseppe Conte told a state TV talk show host, who informed him that four bottles of disinfectant hand gel, which normally sell for a few euros a piece, were being hawked for 200 euros on the internet. The interview was conducted by phone in a studio without an audience after authorities requested that the public not be allowed in for health concerns. Gallera told reporters in Milan that schools, museums, discos, pubs and theaters would stay closed for at least seven days. But restaurants in Milan and other Lombardy cities outside the main cluster area can still operate since, unlike at concerts and other entertainment venues, in eateries people are not congregated in one place and there is space between tables, Gallera said. Lombardy's ban on public events also extended to Masses in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation. Venice also was forbidding public Masses, while in Milan, the city's iconic Gothic cathedral was closed to visitors. School trips inside Italy and overseas were banned. But in the south, thousands turned out for a visit by Pope Francis in the port city of Bari. The pontiff shook hands with many of the faithful. In Lombardy, a populous region which includes the country's financial capital, Milan, nearly all the cases of COVID-19 were in the countryside, mainly in Codogno and nine neighboring towns. In those towns, only grocery stores and pharmacies were permitted to open, and people weren't supposed to enter or leave the towns. Melissa Catanacci, who lives on one of Codogno's main roads, said in the morning, she ventured outside for a stroll along with her husband and two children, ages 10 and 13. Every quarter-hour or so a car goes by on the main road, Catanacci said, speaking by telephone. With businesses closed, the usual Sunday passeggiata'' ” a leisurely stroll through local streets ” didn't last very long, she said. With school to stay shut through the week, her children were visiting their friends' houses or inviting them over to hers to break the boredom, she said. Sporting events were canceled, from children's team practices to Serie A soccer matches which were to be played in northern stadiums. Those measures were ordered Saturday night by the Italian government. Dispensers of hand disinfectant were being installed in trains run by the state railways, which also said it was supplying its crews with masks and disposable gloves. Britain's number of confirmed cases rose to 13, with the positive test results of four Britons who had been aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had been moored for days at a Japanese port when the ship was quarantined. In Austria, security official Franz Lang said the country was considering activating border controls to Italy. Both nations are part of the European Union's visa- and passport-free zone, but under certain circumstances individual countries can reactivate controls. Lang said the situation would be discussed in meetings Monday, local Austrian media reported. In Switzerland, which like Austria borders Italy, there was a call for calm. The news from Italy is worrisome ... but it is too early to think that a wave is rolling our way, Daniel Koch, the head of the department for contagious diseases at the heath office, told the SRF public broadcaster The German health ministry said it had initiated a phone conference for all European Union public health authorities about the outbreak in northern Italy on Monday. French Health Minister Olivier Veran said that authorities were getting ready for a possible outbreak in France of the new virus. In an interview published Sunday in French newspaper Le Parisien he said he was monitoring closely the very serious situation, including in neighboring Italy. Earlier this month, France reported the first death outside Asia of a person infected with the virus, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist. Among those in quarantine in Italy were 274 migrants, rescued in the Mediterranean Sea by a charity ship from boats launched by Libya-based traffickers and allowed to disembark in Pozzallo, Sicily.",business

Welcome to the world of helicopter investing and our call of the day from Barclays Wealth Management's chief investment officer William Hobbs, who finds overly anxious investors living in the long shadow caused by the financial crisis. The most common narrative in markets is what to do when the next recession comes along ” own Treasurys, own gold, own quality to such an extent that my concern would almost be that if the next recession is of a more normal variety, such as a stock retracement of 10% to 15% and moderate declines in unemployment, you'll find that you have overprotected yourself and the underperformance could actually be in the areas which you thought were giving you safety, Hobbs told MarketWatch. Those companies that offer a degree of economic dependability, that enjoy strong competitive advantages, and strong visible cash flows, their worth may be being exaggerated, said Hobbs, adding that some government bonds seem to be return-free risk rather than risk-free returns. The truth is, investors can't reliably predict recessions, and shouldn't be obsessing about it, he said. What we can say is some of the previous causes of some of the nastiest recessions in history are so far substantially absent and Barclays thinks the economic cycle can carry on for a little while longer. Of course, coronavirus ripples could roll up in potentially much more cyclical and disruptive ways that we anticipate, he cautioned. But a smart investor mindset for the next five to 10 years is one that accepts all the bumps in the road can't be dodged, whether from the economy or otherwise. Or, said Hobbs, you miss out on the reason for investing in the first place ” to harvest returns from ongoing human ingenuity. That means diversified exposure to the world's stock markets, and that is the beauty of the modern world relative to the worlds of decades past. I can now get¦almost free access to all of the world's stock markets, and exposure to that global ingenuity, said Hobbs. Where to find all that ingenuity?

That gives the Dow a loss of 847.04 points, or 3.6%, to 27,942.11, while the S&P 500 has fallen 3.6% to 3,218.32, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 4% at 9,160.61. It's always funny how these things work out. We knew that the disease was spreading. We knew that China's data were unreliable . We even knew that Apple's (ticker: AAPL) supply chain would get disrupted by coronavirus. None of those things were a surprise. And yet it took until last week for the market to acknowledge that, Houston, we have a problem. For JonesTrading's Michael O'Rourke, last Friday's drop was due to the market finally realizing that coronavirus would hit the global economy. On Friday, the market finally began to acknowledge the growing global risk of the COVID-19 outbreak, he writes. The weakness of the preliminary Markit PMIs for February finally crystallized the link between the virus and the economic outlook...This weekend, the situation continued to deteriorate as Italy quarantined towns in the Lombardy region around Milan due to a spike in cases. Still, some investors are looking past the coronavirus but acknowledge the short-term pain associated with such outbreaks. During past events of this nature we tend to see a relatively quick recovery, but markets continue to grapple with the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus and the timing around the peak of its widespread harm to both human life and the economy, writes Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. Today's volatile market reaction with investors fleeing risk in favor of safe haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries exemplifies the uncertainty associated to the viral outbreak. The problem, however, may not be coronavirus per se, but the U.S. Federal Reserve, writes Ironsides Macroeconomics's Barry Knapp. Last week, both the minutes from the last Fed meeting and comments made by Richard Clarida showed that a rate cut in 2020 is no sure thing. With that, the market's buffer against coronavirus slowdown was severely weakened. And don't forget about the Nevada caucus, where Bernie Sanders scored a big victory. Politically, Sanders won the Nevada Caucus with more than 40% of the vote, implying his base is bigger than thought, meaning he might be a more formidable opponent to Trump than what the market was previously thinking, writes The Sevens Report's Tom Essaye.

All times are U.S. Eastern Time. Israel may quarantine some 200 visitors from South Korea at a military base in a Jewish settlement on the occupied West Bank over coronavirus fears, according to Israel's Ynet news site. Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said separately he had ordered South Korea and Japan to be added to a list of Asian countries to which travel to and from Israel was being barred. Austria has halted train traffic with its southern neighbor amid concern that two passengers on an in-bound train from Italy were infected with the coronavirus. Italy is grappling with the largest coronavirus outbreak outside of Asia, with more than 130 reported cases and three deaths. Air New Zealand cut its 2020 outlook, as the impact from the coronavirus and subsequent capacity reductions appear set to offset benefits from lower jet fuel prices, Reuters reported. The airline said the negative impact to earnings was between $22.2 million and $47.4 million, Reuters said. Four passengers tested positive for the virus in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, according to Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty. ""Four further patients in England have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to thirteen,"" the statement from the chief medical officer for England said.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking after a meeting of G20 financial leaders, told reporters that central bankers will look at options for responding to the virus as needed. ""I'm not going to comment on monetary policy, but obviously central bankers will look at various different options as this has an impact on the economy,"" he said. A third person infected with the coronavirus has died in Italy, a regional official said, as the government struggles to contain an outbreak of the illness in the north of the country with more than 130 cases reported since Friday. Lombardy regional councilor Giulio Gallera told reporters the victim was an elderly woman from the town of Crema, east of Milan, who was also suffering from cancer. Two other elderly patients in northern Italy have died over the past 48 hours. The government has placed a dozen towns under quarantine and closed down schools. Paolo Gentiloni, the European commissioner for economic affairs, told CNBC that there's a ""clear will"" from governments to react if the virus outbreak persists. ""Our assessment that was made here at G20 was to update continuously information on this situation and be ready to react if the downside risk will materialize,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Gentiloni said the European Union sees ""no need to panic"" over a coronavirus outbreak in Italy that has already killed two people and infected more than 100 in the country. The comments came after a meeting of G20 financial leaders in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia's finance minister said that finance officials from the Group of 20 major economies agreed to continue monitoring the risk from the coronavirus outbreak and to adopt appropriate policies to limit the global economic impact. The coronavirus that originated in China will have a negative impact on the global economy even if it is rapidly contained, and it would be prudent to prepare for more significant consequences, the head of the IMF said. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, in a statement issued after a meeting of finance officials from the world's 20 largest economies, called for coordinated action to contain the human and economic impact of the virus. The last two days of the Venice Carnival, which draws tourists from around the world, have been canceled because of an outbreak of coronavirus, the head of the Veneto region Luca Zaia said. Events scheduled for Sunday in the lagoon city would continue as planned. ""But as of this evening there will be a ban on the Venice Carnival as well as on all events, sporting as well, until March 1 inclusive,"" Zaia said. Turkey will close its border with Iran as a precautionary measure to halt the potential spread of coronavirus after the neighboring country reported 43 cases of the disease, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. All highways and railways will be closed as of 5 p.m. local time on Sunday and flights from Iran suspended. South Korea raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"" as cases continued to rise. A sixth person has died from the coronavirus in South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention said Sunday evening. South Korea's new cases jumped by 169 over the weekend, bringing the its total infected to 602. Chinese Premier Xi Jinping said the coronavirus situation in China is still ""serious and complex,"" according to a Reuters translation of state media. He also said that the country would maintain a ""prudent"" monetary policy, and would introduce new policy measures in a timely way, Reuters reported. Xi said the epidemic was a major public health emergency with ""the fastest spread, the widest range of infections, and the most difficult prevention and control in China"" since the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to state media. China is the epicenter of the new coronavirus, with 76,936 cases and 2,442 deaths on the mainland as of Feb. 22.

"Bill Hanage,Marc Lipsitch",2/23/2020,scientificamerican,How to Report on the COVID-19 Outbreak Responsibly - Scientific American Blog Network,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-to-report-on-the-covid-19-outbreak-responsibly/,"The profusion of information that keeps emerging about the growing COVID-19 outbreak presents challenges for reporters and the scientists they talk to when researching their stories. Good reporting and science have to distinguish legitimate sources of information from no end of rumors, half-truths, financially motivated promotions of snake-oil remedies and politically motivated propaganda. While keeping track of the outbreak, we've become aware of how hard this vigilance is for even the most energetic and well-motivated scientists and journalists, given the firehose of available information from both traditional sources (public health authorities, journals) and new ones (preprints, blogs). To help in this effort, we think reporting should distinguish between at least three levels of information: (A) what we know is true; (B) what we think is true”fact-based assessments that also depend on inference, extrapolation or educated interpretation of facts that reflect an individual's view of what is most likely to be going on; and (C) opinions and speculation. In category A are facts, such as that the infection is caused by a beta-coronavirus; that the initial viral genome sequences of the virus were very similar; and that human-to-human transmission happens frequently”along with the number of reported cases in various locations, and the like. Multiple lines of evidence, including peer-reviewed scientific studies and reports from public health authorities, support these as facts. In category B is the vast majority of what we would like to know about the epidemic but don't because no systematic data exist on the true number of cases in any location; the extent of community transmission outside of China”or the fraction of cases that are spreading undetected; the true proportion of infections that are mild, asymptomatic or subclinical; and the degree to which presymptomatic cases can be transmitted. On these topics, experts can give opinions informed by their understanding of other infectious diseases; infer the consequences of available data (for example, they can infer unreported imported cases from the differences in reported imports in countries with similar travel volumes from infected areas); or perhaps gain insights from information that they have heard about and trust but that has not yet been publicly released. This category includes projections of the likely long-term trajectory of the epidemic. These views benefit from the expert judgment of the scientists who hold them and are worthy of reporting, but they should be distinguished from hard facts. In category C are many other issues for which the current evidence is exceedingly limited, such as the effect of extreme social distancing on slowing the epidemic. There are also questions that will never be truly settled by data, such as those about the motivations of governments and health authorities. It's not that these topics don't matter. It's just that they're not accessible to science right now and may not ever be. At their best, scientists and reporters are trying to do many of the same things”providing accurate information and interpreting it”but with different audiences and timescales. Beyond remembering the three different sorts of information that scientists can offer, how else can they ensure that they are doing this job well? We think several principles can help. 1. Seek diverse sources of information. Because no one has digested everything about the state of the epidemic, different experts will know different things and see different holes in our reasoning. This advice applies to scientists, as well as journalists: the best scientists” will consult their colleagues and ask them to find weaknesses in the scientists' work before sharing the work more broadly”especially in a setting like this one, where the representativeness and accuracy of data are necessarily uncertain. 2. Slow down a little. We are all on a deadline of some sort to avoid being scooped. Someone on Twitter recently pointed out that facts about this epidemic that have lasted a few days are far more reliable than the latest facts that have just come out, which may be erroneous or unrepresentative and thus misleading. We have to balance this caution with the need to share our work promptly. Indeed, the categories of fact, informed belief, and speculation above are fluid, and given the fast-moving pace of information about the epidemic, a question that today can be answered only informed belief may perhaps be answered with a fact tomorrow.* 3. Distinguish between whether something ever happens and whether it is happening at a frequency that matters. A good example is the question of presymptomatic transmission. If it occurs frequently, it will make control measures that target sick people (isolation, treatment and contact tracing) less effective. It is very likely that presymptomatic transmission happens at some frequency, but the evidence is very limited at present. Knowing that it happens sometimes is of little use; we desperately need evidence on how often it happens. The same is true for infected travelers escaping detection. Of course, this event will happen for many reasons. Again, the question is how often it happens”and whether it leads to the establishment of local transmission. Emergencies like this one lead to extreme pressure on both scientists and journalists to be the first with news. And there are perverse incentives arising from the attention economy we now inhabit”exacerbated by social media”that may provide short-term rewards for those willing to accept lower standards.Β Accurate reporting should be aware of this risk, seek to avoid contributing to it and rapidly correct falsehoods when they become clear. We have a common responsibility to protect public health. The virus does not read news articles and doesn't care about Twitter. *Editor's note: the final sentence of this paragraph was added for clarity after posting.",science
By Choe Sang-Hun,2/23/2020,nytimes,"As Coronavirus Cases Spiral, South Korea Raises Threat Alert Level",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-moon.html,"SEOUL, South Korea ” As South Korea struggles to contain a snowballing coronavirus outbreak, its president on Sunday raised the country's alert level to the highest for the first time in a decade, which empowered the government to lock down cities, bar visitors from China and unilaterally restrict the movement of people. In raising the alert level, President Moon Jae-in is effectively acknowledging that the virus is threatening to spin out of control, after the number of cases has jumped to 763 in a few days and the death toll has risen to six. The world is closely watching South Korea, concerned that it has become another hot spot of infection outside China. Emerging outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy have provoked fear that the epidemic could turn into a global pandemic, as countries impose more travel restrictions and containment measures. The United States has raised its travel advisories for South Korea and Japan, warning about sustained community spread. Israel denied entry to 130 South Koreans on board a Korean Air flight that landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday, forcing them to return home on the same plane. In recent days, the South Korean government has shut day care centers, banned outdoor rallies and postponed the reopening of schools in early March. Churches are asking congregants to stay home and pray online instead. But Mr. Moon said South Korea faced a wholly different situation after the quickly expanding outbreak of the virus among members of a Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, 180 miles southeast of Seoul. More than half of all the patients in the country are either members of Shincheonji or their relatives and other contacts. In Daegu, shopping districts, supermarkets and parks were empty as the government asked citizens to stay home. On Sunday, South Korean officials said they had no immediate plan to bar Chinese visitors ” as some conservative news outlets and other critics have demanded ” or lock down any cities. But by putting the country on the highest alert, they showed their resolve to take more aggressive steps if needed. This is the first time since 2009 that the country has been put on the highest alert; at that time, it was battling the swine flu spreading around the world. We should not be bound by regulations, nor should we shy away from unprecedented strong measures, Mr. Moon said at an emergency government meeting on Sunday. The alert, known as Level 4, will allow the government to allocate more money for fighting the virus and make it easier for health officials to acquire the personal data of people suspected of being infected, as well as outlaw religious and other gatherings. It will also empower health officials to control air, train and other public traffic around the country. Health officials hope that the number of new patients connected to Shincheonji will drop significantly within a week or so. They have already screened most members of the church showing potential symptoms, and many have been tested for the virus. We are faced with a watershed moment in the case of the coronavirus, Mr. Moon said. The coming few days will be a critical time for us. This will be a momentous time when the central government, local governments and the whole people must wage an all-out, concerted response to the problem. Until now, South Korean officials had been reluctant to raise the alert level, worried that such a drastic measure would hurt the country's already slowing economy, as well as undermine its image as a country safe for travel. In China where the virus originated, the economy has come to a standstill, while the country has been essentially cut off from the rest of the world. South Korea's economic troubles have deepened in recent weeks, with exports to China, its biggest trading partner, sharply dropping because of the outbreak. South Korean auto and other companies that rely on parts from China have also suffered. Despite its extensive ties with China, South Korea had initially appeared to cope well in containing the spread of the coronavirus. After reporting its first case on Jan. 20, the number of patients remained low. By Feb. 15, the country had 28 cases and no deaths. A few days later, the situation began to unravel, when an infected patient was found in the large congregation of the Shincheonji Church in Daegu, a city of 2.4 million. Since then, the number of patients has exploded, mostly among members of Christian church and people connected to them. For now, the outbreak has been largely limited to Daegu and the surrounding North Kyongsang Province, which account for the majority of the infections. But several new cases have emerged in towns across South Korea, most of them Shincheonji worshipers who have attended church services in Daegu or people who have traveled to the city or have met people from there. Updated June 12, 2020 So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was very rare,  but she later walked back that statement. Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus ” whether it's surface transmission or close human contact ” is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation's job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. When you haven't been exercising, you lose muscle mass. Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren't being told to stay at home, it's still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. A large number of people gathered in a very closed space, holding their prayer services together for one to two hours, said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, referring to the Shincheonji church. In such an environment, it was likely that even a few patients spread the disease to many people. Although health officials have frantically tried to track down church members and direct contacts, they acknowledged that it had become increasingly hard to establish the chain of transmissions once the community spread began. Shincheonji worshipers have been noted for their secrecy, often hiding their membership even to their parents, said former members and experts on religious sects. In their efforts to contain the outbreak, officials have designated coronavirus-only hospitals and have required all people visiting regular hospitals with respiratory symptoms to be tested for the virus. With some towns fearing a lack of hospital beds, the government recently expedited the approval of newly built hospital wards so they could be quickly used to accommodate more patients. Subway stations, coffee shops and movie theaters were all required to install hand sanitizers for customers to use. The government also empowered doctors to order a coronavirus test even if a patient doesn't want it. During a telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, President Moon sympathized with Beijing's efforts to battle the virus, saying that China's difficulties are our own difficulties. More than 10,000 Chinese students are expected to return to South Korea in the coming week after winter vacations, as their South Korean universities are scheduled to reopen in early March. That has raised fears among some South Koreans. On Sunday, officials said the Chinese students will be asked not to come to school for two weeks, officials said. The government also changed the opening day of kindergartens and high schools, to March 9, from March 2. We don't agree with the argument that we are trying to catch mosquitoes while keeping the windows open, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said last week, dismissing the demand for a ban on Chinese visitors, as the United States and dozens of other countries have done. He said more people have been infected by South Koreans' returning from China than by Chinese visitors. The raising of the alert level came a day after thousands of older Christian activists dismissed his government's appeals not to gather in large groups and pressed ahead with their weekly anti-government protest. They accused Mr. Moon of mismanaging the economy and being too friendly toward North Korea and China. At the protest, most of the participants wore masks but loudly chanted antigovernment slogans and Amens. We will defend South Korea even if we get infected with the virus and die, said the Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, who had organized the rally, shouted at the cheering crowd. Those of you who are here are true Christians. Even if we contract the virus, the Lord will cure us.",business
By Choe Sang-Hun and Derrick Bryson Taylor,2/23/2020,nytimes,Coronavirus Spreads as New Cases Double in South Korea,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-iran.html,"SEOUL, South Korea ” The coronavirus spread to more countries and the numbers of new cases and deaths outside of China climbed, with special concern focused on South Korea, where infections doubled in a single day ” raising fears that another Asian country was losing control of the escalating epidemic. By Saturday, the virus had been identified in two new countries, Lebanon and Israel, bringing the spread to 28 countries, with about 1,500 confirmed cases outside of China, where it originated. The death toll in Iran rose to six, the highest outside of China, and the number of confirmed cases there reached 28, though experts suggest that the real number is likely to be far higher. South Korea's prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, called the situation in his country grave and urged citizens to cooperate with the government and avoid large political gatherings, which have continued in the capital, Seoul, despite a city ban. The government will sternly deal with acts that interfere with quarantine efforts, illegal hoarding of hygiene goods and acts that spark uneasiness through massive rallies, Mr. Chung warned in a nationally televised address. The spike of cases in Korea and the rising death toll in Iran raised fears that the window to avert a global pandemic was narrowing. The World Health Organization warned African leaders of the urgency of preparing for the virus, and identified 13 African countries as priorities because of their direct links to China and the high volume of travel between the countries. The number of confirmed infections in South Korea, after more than doubling on Saturday, rose to 556 on Sunday morning. More than half were among members of a secretive religious sect, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, and their relatives and other contacts. Most of the cases are centered in and near Daegu, the country's fourth largest city, which has been placed under a state of emergency. Between Daegu, a city of 2.4 million people, and a nearby province where the sect's members often do volunteer work, 465 people have tested positive. In the neighborhood of the sect's church in the city, banks, coffee shops, restaurants and convenience stores have all shut down, rendering it a ghost town. Across the city, department stores, shopping alleys and traditional outdoor marketplaces have all been drained of shoppers. The only busy sites were government-run health centers, where citizens lined up to find out whether they were infected.",business
By Farah Stockman,2/23/2020,nytimes,Don't Send Them Here: Local Officials Resist Plans to House Coronavirus Patients,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/us/coronavirus-quarantine-california-alabama.html,"The scramble to find places to quarantine American coronavirus patients is beginning to run into resistance from local officials who do not want the patients housed in their backyards. The city of Costa Mesa, Calif., has gone to court to block state and federal officials, at least temporarily, from placing dozens of people evacuated from Asia in a state-owned residential center in their community. A hearing on the issue in federal court is scheduled for 2 p.m. Pacific time on Monday. And Alabama officials have reacted with alarm to news that coronavirus patients could be sent as early as Wednesday to a Federal Emergency Management building on a former army base in Anniston, Ala., about 90 miles west of Atlanta. Uncertainty and distrust are stymieing federal attempts to plan for quarantining Americans who are infected with the coronavirus. At least 34 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus, most of them after traveling abroad, and the authorities have warned of the seriousness of the threat. So far, no one in the United States has died of the disease, and at least four patients in this country are said to have fully recovered. Yet local officials have expressed concerns that little is being done to prepare for a potential influx of patients, and that much is still unknown about the virus, which has killed at least 2,461 people, all but 19 of them in mainland China. transcript Voices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare. People who are willing to speak out about the government's attempts to control news about the deadly coronavirus.

Dr. Li's become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who's winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance. At a hastily called news conference on Saturday, elected officials in Costa Mesa, a city of 113,000 people about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, expressed opposition to a state plan to send dozens of patients to the Fairview Developmental Center, a nearly vacant state hospital formerly used for people with developmental disabilities. We're a compassionate community, said the city's mayor, Katrina Foley. But we are not going to continue to be the place where everybody drops off their crises and expects us to correct it. The patients involved would be people now quarantined at Travis Air Force Base who have tested positive for the coronavirus but do not have severe symptoms requiring hospital care. Several people confirmed to have the virus are quarantined in their homes across the United States, but that is not an option for some, including people who do not live alone; the authorities are trying to find a secure place for them to stay. Wherever they go, they would be kept away from contact with the public until the danger of contagion passes.",business
By Ian Johnson,2/23/2020,nytimes,Religious Groups in China Step Into the Coronavirus Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/asia/china-religion-coronavirus-donations.html,"Earlier this month, the hard-hit town of Caohe, near the center of the coronavirus outbreak in central China, received an unexpected gift: a large donation from a Taoist nunnery 550 miles away. Another Taoist temple, this one in Caohe itself, contributed tens of thousands of dollars worth of medical equipment to help those sickened by the virus. The moment believers heard the news, they called us and asked how to help, said a nun who organized one of the fund-raising drives. In temples, mosques and churches, China's religious believers have jumped into the national battle against the coronavirus. They have offered prophecies and prayers, ceremonies and services, as well as donations totaling more than $30 million. Their efforts reflect the country's decades-long religious revival, and the feeling among many Chinese that faith-based groups provide an alternative to the corruption that has plagued the government. transcript Voices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare.

But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance. Ten years ago when you looked for this sort of faith-based giving and engagement you couldn't really find it, said Wu Keping, an anthropologist at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou. Now people think of it as normal. But not all the efforts have been well received. The Communist Party has long distrusted any organization, from churches to charities to civic groups, that it believes could come between the government and the Chinese people. The party a few years ago put in place new regulations to tighten already severe state control. Some recent contributions have been hampered by such pressures. Earlier this month, seven underground Protestant churches in Beijing raised $10,000 to buy face masks and disinfectants for those in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, where more than 1,800 people have died. After sending the shipment on Feb. 5, the police called in church leaders for questioning and told them to stop their activities, according to church members who asked not to be identified by name for fear of attracting additional government surveillance. The Rev. Huang Lei, the leader of an underground church in Wuhan, said local officials have rejected their donations because they fear trouble with more senior officials for cooperating with what the government in Beijing considers to be illegal organizations. In China the government likes to control all channels for donating money, Pastor Huang said in a telephone interview. They don't like civil society to participate, and especially not faith-based organizations. Still, many religious groups ” particularly those that have registered with the government ” have been doing just that. According to recent figures from their websites, the China Buddhist Association has contributed $14 million to the fight against the coronavirus, the Protestant association $10 million, the Islamic association $4.5 million, the Catholic association $1.5 million and the Taoist association $1.9 million. Some donations have been prompted by dissatisfaction with China's large government-run charities. The Red Cross, the China Charity Federation, the Hubei Charity Federation and the Hubei Youth Development Foundation have donated the equivalent of $1.9 billion. But their work has been plagued by accusations of corruption, leading the national Red Cross to send a review team to Hubei Province, where Wuhan is. These charities also often channel money from big businesses, while the donations from China's religious organizations are led by grass-roots efforts supported by ordinary people, said Professor Wu. The two Taoist temples that helped the town of Caohe received hundreds of small donations from believers, according to lists published on the temples' social media accounts. In the Chinese city of Wenzhou, the Rev. Wu Shengli of the Chengxi Protestant Church said the city's Protestant churches were asked by local officials if they could donate roughly 1 million yuan, or about $143,000. He said that worshipers were glad to do it. People aren't reluctant, he said. People are very willing to help out and the final amount will be higher. Susan McCarthy, a political scientist at Providence College who studies faith-based charities in China, said these kinds of donations can also help religious organizations prove their loyalty to the state. The government is happy if religious groups make contributions but is wary that they will use charity to expand their base and infiltrate society, Ms. McCarthy said. My sense is a lot of this is defensive, or to prove their patriotism, she said of the churches. Updated June 12, 2020 So far, the evidence seems to show it does.

This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. But for many believers, the nonmaterial aid is the most meaningful. Even though all places of worship in China are closed as part of the effort to prevent the virus from spreading, temples and churches have been organizing prayer vigils, while halal restaurants in Wuhan have provided free meals and boxed lunches to medical staff at local hospitals. The Changchun Taoist temple in Wuhan has held ceremonies to purify the land, a traditional Taoist ritual used when illness or ill fortune strikes a region. To know that they are in the temple, praying for us is comforting, Wang Derui, a 42-year-old who used to regularly go to the temple to listen to lectures on traditional culture, said in a telephone interview. We can't go but they are sending up prayers on our behalf. Religion also inspired the songwriter Zhang Shuzhi to compose a piece that is meant to lift spirits ” but also critique the social and moral ills that he believes underlie the outbreak. Noting that the two new hospitals built in Wuhan in record time earlier this month were named after Taoist deities who punish evil, Mr. Zhang reread the Taoist classics, and then wrote his song. Today people act without virtueAnd blaspheme against heaven and earthIn the human world greed has broken outAnd things are no longer in a normal state. The song is meant to give people energy and strength, Mr. Zhang said. It is also meant to help people rise up despite the difficulties and fight the disease. Amber Wang contributed reporting.",business
By Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo,2/23/2020,nytimes,Europe Confronts Coronavirus as Italy Battles an Eruption of Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/europe/italy-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=2,"CASALPUSTERLENGO, Italy ” Europe confronted its first major outbreak of the coronavirus as an eruption of more than 150 cases in Italy prompted officials on Sunday to lock down at least 10 towns, close schools in major cities and cancel sporting events and cultural touchstones, including the end of the Venice carnival. The worrisome spike ” from fewer than five known cases in Italy before Thursday ” shattered the sense of safety and distance that much of the continent had felt in recent months even as the virus has infected more than 78,000 worldwide and killed more than 2,400, nearly all in China. transcript Voices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare. People who are willing to speak out about the government's attempts to control news about the deadly coronavirus. They asked to remain anonymous, because what they're doing could put them and their families at great risk. But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens, fighting to get the message out in a country that aggressively censors information. Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech are quickly scrubbed from the internet. Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about life under lockdown. [clanging] Posted online one day, but gone the next. But the crisis over the coronavirus is changing the landscape, for now at least. Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting information the government doesn't want out there. Experts say this kind of digital resistance is happening at a scale they've never seen before. Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China. But internet savvy people use techniques that allow them to repost censored content to these platforms, while staying under the radar of authorities. They're creating a visual archive by preserving videos like this one, showing overwhelmed hospitals. [screaming] And they're reposting people's personal stories. Some are also turning to less obvious platforms, including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders. Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on? They're making open and widespread calls for freedom of speech. These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus, and was punished by officials for speaking out. He died in early February from the coronavirus. Right after his death, the hashtag I want freedom of speech started to trend on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. Then, it was quickly censored by the government. Dr. Li's become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who's winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance. The perception of a rising threat was amplified on television channels, newspaper headlines and social media feeds across Europe, where leaders could face their greatest challenge since the 2015 migration crisis. That surge of people into Europe radically altered the politics of the European Union and exposed its institutional weaknesses. This time, it is an invisible virus from abroad that has slipped past Europe's borders and presents its bickering coalitions with a new potential emergency. If the virus spreads, the fundamental principle of open borders within much of Europe ” so central to the identity of the bloc ” will undergo a stress test, as will the vaunted but strained European public health systems, especially in countries that have undergone austerity measures. Already, a new nervousness has pervaded Europe. In Italy's Lombardy region, 10 towns were locked down after a cluster of cases suddenly emerged in Codogno, southeast of Milan. Residents were supposed to leave or enter the towns only with special permission, affecting at least 50,000 people, and by Sunday night, police officers in surgical masks were waving down cars. Austrian officials stopped a train en route from Italy to Austria and Germany to test passengers for the virus. The Austrian interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said the tests came back negative so the train got the all clear. In France, the new health minister, Olivier Veran, stressed the country's preparedness, saying it would significantly ramp up its testing. There is a problematic situation at the door, in Italy, that we are watching with great attention, he said on Sunday, adding that a Europe-wide discussion between health ministers was in the works. On Sunday night, an aid ship bringing hundreds of migrants, who had been rescued off the coast of Libya, to a Sicilian port received instructions from the Italian government to remain in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution, according to the ship's Twitter account. Fears of foreigners spreading the virus across oceans has already prompted some governments around the world to impose new border or travel controls. The Trump administration has barred entry to the United States by most foreign nationals who have recently visited China, where the virus first appeared and spread. Much of the world has adopted similar controls, but the virus has continued to spread, most notably to South Korea, where more cases have been recorded than anywhere else outside China, and this past week to Iran, where eight deaths have been reported. Israel on Monday will block entry to all nonresidents who have visited Japan and South Korea in the 14 days before their arrival. On Sunday, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, which has 763 confirmed infections and six deaths, put the country on the highest possible alert, empowering the government to ban visitors from China and take other sweeping measures to contain the outbreak. The coming few days will be a critical time for us, Mr. Moon said at an emergency meeting of government officials. Even China ” with an authoritarian government that has locked down areas with tens of millions of people in an attempt to stamp out the epidemic ” has struggled to contain the virus, which has no known cure. But the scores of new cases in Italy, mostly in the Lombardy region that includes densely populated Milan, present a new challenge for a country with a wobbly government often paralyzed by infighting. AUSTRIA SWITZ. SLOV. LOMBARDY Milan Venice CROATIA Codogno Adriatic Sea ITALY Rome 100 miles By The New York Times That government has now become the reluctant laboratory to test whether the virus can be successfully contained in an open European society with a liberal approach to restrictions. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said on Italian television on Sunday that the country had taken precautions, including barring flights from China in January. These measures seemed to have paid off even if now it looks like it didn't, he said. He suggested that the surge of Italian cases only reflected Italy's casting a wider net in terms of testing. We cannot exclude that after tests that are equally rigorous, the numbers can go up in other countries, Mr. Conte said. Beatrice Lorenzin, a former Italian health minister, said the sharp rise in cases in Italy resulted from systematic checks that discovered a second generation of contagion. She said this was probably caused by infected people who traveled to Italy from China using indirect flights without declaring their original departure point or putting themselves in voluntary quarantine during the virus' incubation period. I hope similar things did not happen in other countries, she said. The outbreak in Codogno, in Lombardy, was detected after a 38-year-old man was admitted to the city's hospital and given a diagnosis on Thursday. But the man had developed symptoms perhaps five days before that, potentially allowing the virus to spread. Health officials are trying to figure out how he contracted the virus; he had not been to China. Many cases in Lombardy, officials say, may be traceable to that one case. At least five members of the hospital medical staff and several patients have been infected. Other persons who tested positive include the man's pregnant wife, some friends, and others who spent time with them. The towns surrounding the ones where the man works and lives have been included in the shutdown. On Sunday night on a road outside Casalpusterlengo, one of the locked-down towns, police officers in surgical masks halted cars, asking what business they had in the town. The officers suggested that motorists take an alternate route and urged them against going any further. Most of the drivers didn't need much convincing. Bahije Mounia, a 42-year-old caretaker from a nearby town who wore a surgical mask, turned right back around. She said the government should have let people in the area know how dangerous things were much earlier. With the spike of cases in the region, she said, It's almost like we're in China. Updated May 20, 2020 Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea. Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing.

They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. What had seemed like a contained few cases spread throughout the country's wealthy north. So did the precautions. People wore surgical masks in Aosta, which is on the Swiss border. Officials in the Piedmont region closed schools in Turin, and Venice cut its Carnival short. The patriarch of Venice, the Reverend Francesco Moraglia, suspended all religious ceremonies, including Ash Wednesday celebrations that mark the beginning of Lent. At least two trade fairs in Milan, cornerstones of the city's economy, were postponed. But the women's fashion shows, except for those by Armani, continued on schedule on Sunday to large crowds, with few wearing masks, The Associated Press reported. The Giorgio Armani fashion house made a last-minute decision to stream its shows from empty theaters. Two elderly people who tested positive for the coronavirus were in intensive care at Venice's municipal hospital. In the regional capital of Milan, officials closed museums, schools, its cathedral, and halted religious and cultural events. Many other venues, aside from those providing essential services, have been closed, including most bars and nightclubs. Fears that the city could be quarantined triggered a run on supermarkets. By 5 p.m. on Sunday, at least one supermarket had run out of fruit, vegetables, meat and nearly all canned food. Some of the customers wore masks, and they all seemed in a hurry to fill up their carts with whatever was left on the shelves. Vanessa Maiocchi, 45, said she worried about getting her children enough food. She was also concerned that her brother, who has a weak immune system, might be more vulnerable, especially if his company kept making him go to work. At least in these cases, she said, the state should intervene. So far, the virus has killed three people in Italy, including a 78-year-old man from Veneto who died Friday; an elderly woman who died in Crema on Sunday; and a 77-year-old woman who died in her home in Casalpusterlengo and posthumously tested positive for the virus. The Italian state, which leads the third largest economy in the eurozone, has not inspired much confidence of late, as it has been consumed by internal machinations. But health experts said they were more worried because the Italian health ministry appeared to have moved aggressively to prevent an outbreak, to no avail. Francesco Passerini, the mayor of Codogno, said in an interview on Sunday evening that he still had not received concrete logistical instructions from Rome. Who is going to bring essential goods here? he said. Who is going to take care of provisions and medical transportation? Two military structures in Lombardy are being prepared to become isolation camps. A military base in Rome has been housing evacuees from Wuhan, China, where the virus began, and the Italian passengers of the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that has been under quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. Lockdown procedures like the ones in Lombardy will be applied to other towns if new clusters emerge, officials said. Quarantine measures will also be applied to anyone who has close contact with someone who has the virus. Elia Delmiglio, the mayor of Casalpusterlengo, said people continued going in and out of his town for most of the day on Sunday. We got the decree, but not a precise schedule for when it will be implemented, he said. But by late Sunday night, police began arriving to seal the town off. People are worried, said Paolo Camia, a 55-year-old manager of a software company from Casalpusterlengo, who drove out of town in his blue surgical mask to take some pictures of the police checkpoints. Basically, we can't leave. Jason Horowitz reported from Casalpusterlengo, Italy, and Milan, and Elisabetta Povoledo reported from Rome.

The answer is always no. Mr. Wang, 49, used to be able to find work in Shenzhen, a sprawling industrial megacity. But factories are turning him away because he is from Hubei Province, the center of China's coronavirus epidemic, even though he hasn't lived there in years. There's nothing I can do, said Mr. Wang, who has only a few dollars left in savings, lives off plain noodles and rents a small room for about $60 a month. I'm just by myself, isolated and helpless. China's roughly 300 million rural migrants have long lived on the margins of society, taking on grueling work for meager wages and limited access to public health care and education. But now they are among the hardest hit as China's leader, Xi Jinping, calls for a people's war to contain the virus and the authorities impose controls across broad swaths of the country. As outsiders, rural migrants, no matter where they are from, are an easy target. Many factories are afraid to restart operations in case their workers are carrying the virus, raising concerns that the government's controls could smother the economy. Local officials have barred many migrants from crossing city lines. Landlords have kicked them out of their apartments. Some are crammed into hotels or sleeping under bridges or on sidewalks. We have struggled so much already, Liu Wen, 42, a factory worker in Zhengzhou, a city in central China, who was evicted from her apartment because she had returned from her husband's hometown in the southern province of Guangdong and her landlord worried she might be carrying the virus. She now is living with her husband and two children in a hotel. Now we've lost hope. On Sunday, Mr. Xi acknowledged that the situation in China remained grim and complex, but urged party officials to not only continue their efforts to contain the virus but also to focus on restarting production. We must turn pressure into motivation, be good at turning crisis into opportunity, orderly restore production and living order, he said. But the strict lockdowns imposed across the country make it difficult for rural workers to return to cities; only about a third have done so, according to official statistics. Many workers are stuck in the countryside after traveling there last month to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday. Mr. Xi, already under scrutiny for the Chinese government's slow and erratic response to the coronavirus outbreak, now faces pressure to quell anger among low-income families and dispel broader fears of an economic downturn. The party has long staked its legitimacy on the idea that it can deliver prosperity and protect the working class.",business
By Vanessa Friedman,2/23/2020,nytimes,The Techlash Comes to Milan. So Does the Coronavirus Fear.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/style/milan-fashion-week-bottega-veneta-marni.html,"MILAN ” The last days of Milan Fashion Week took place as cases of the coronavirus crept closer and news reports came that at least two people had died in nearby cities. Though there were temperature checks at the airport ” a uniformed man with an electronic thermometer greeted people disembarking from London ” apparently it wasn't enough. Schools and public spaces were ordered closed. But not the shows! Though a cough nearby could often pause conversation, the shows would (and did) go on. At least until the very end. Then Giorgio Armani, given the theoretic honor of being the closer, announced he would unveil his collection behind closed doors. The decision was taken to safeguard the well-being of all his invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces. Instead, it would be held in his empty theater, and streamed live. Through a screen (or phone), it was possible to see the empty Armani theater, a facsimile of a reflecting pool with nodding lotus blossoms at its core. Out flowed models wearing iterations of Armani classics in black velvet and flowers etched on silk in pink and blue; languorous silhouettes and strains of Swan Lake; cavalry epaulets, watery moirΓ© and tufts of new leaf marabou ” and a finale of red, black and blue sequined gowns with pyramid shoulders and traditional knotted black tassels, all gowns taken, according to the news release, from the Giorgio Armani PrivΓ© Spring/Summer 2009 and 2019 collections, which were specifically inspired by China. After the controversy that Mr. Armani caused earlier in the week, when he said during a news conference with Italian journalists after his Emporio Armani show that women were regularly raped' by designers because they were pushed to submit to trends and wear clothes that were overly sexual and inappropriate for their age, body or mind-set (he didn't exactly apologize afterward, though he did make a statement saying he wished had used another word), the ghost show made for a strange, subdued ending to a relatively subdued set of collections. Every chief executive sitting front row at their brand's fashion show and greeting guests with enthusiasm would later turn to the side and whisper, sotto voce, the situation is complicated. There's been a lot of beige. A lot of protective layering. A lot of wrapping things for warmth, as Veronica Etro said backstage before her whistle stop tour of lavishly decorated gauchos and bohos; (security) blanket coats; denim, paisley and lamΓ©; all of it finished in a series of weather-resistant patent leather slickers in black, which she dubbed a color that protects. Sex is off the agenda. Even at Versace, the brand that went viral last season with Jennifer Lopez live and leaving little to the imagination in jungle print, Donatella Versace was singing the praises of sensuality that is almost restrained, sketched and never shouted in her show notes. Everything is relative, so that actually meant (for both men and women; increasingly the dual-gender shows are not about gender fluidity but one for him, one for her) big 1980s shoulders and belted jackets; zebra stripes and supersonic florals; metallic pinstripes and black leather; slashed slip dresses held together by chunky gold staples and chain mail glam. Still, it's a sign of the times: Familiarity can be a refuge, even if it feels a little stale. There's been a general about-face away from the digital world and its virtues (what virtues? being the operative principle), save for a trend toward LED screens as a backdrop in numerous shows, like a Band-Aid of modernity. As far as clothes, the techlash has become infectious. Instead, the focus was on craft, and tradition. I need to return to my culture, said the shoe designer Giuseppe Zanotti during his presentation, looking longingly at one of the delicate court shoes with a tuft of feathers and horsehair at the ankle on display, rather than one of his sneakers, which he called a monster of his own creation (though he still had a lot of them; needs must). He was tired, since he had woken up early to do a series of live streams for his employees, editors and influencers in China, who hadn't been able to make it to Milan. I killed my sensibility, he said mournfully. Francesco Risso, waxing philosophic at the end of his Marni show, echoed the same idea. Behind each object is a hand, but is it the hand of time or the time of the hand? he said, referring to a collection which had been like nothing so much as a D.I.Y. trip down the rabbit hole to the warrior queendom of Zog (Mr. Risso took his bow in a white rabbit mask that encased his entire head; the atelier had made it for him the night before). Scraps of leathers and suedes were patchworked together in a rough Betty-Rubble-meets-the-Road-Warrior series of sleeveless minidresses and billowing greatcoats; tunics and trousers, and princess chemises held together by a big silk bow at the breast. Later cable knits met ribbed knits met angora on chunky cardigans, and tapestry fabrics he said were woven in Venice on looms invented by Leonardo da Vinci were spliced into velvet brocades and silk. Even molten gold and silver got collaged in, framing holes in the fabric like melting portals to a recycled world. Make do and mend never looked so good. Tactility is staging a return ” especially among the founding families of Milanese fashion. At Salvatore Ferragamo, Paul Andrew played with plush shearling and foliage-embroidered chunky cashmere and trompe l'oeil corseted tweeds. At Missoni, Angela Missoni sent out geometric knit bathrobe coats and cardigans like a hug for the urban professional (also ribbed Lurex polo dresses over matching leggings). And at Agnona, Simon Holloway wrapped and layered and enveloped in camel cashmere and cream shearling, gray flannel and ebony double-face wool. If it sounds so timeless it would fit Rip Van Winkle, it was, a bit. Almost every brand created a brown leather trench. Safety is often boring. But it doesn't have to be. Or so Daniel Lee showed at Bottega Veneta, abandoning the tough-guy trickiness that had marked the clothes in his first two shows in favor of extreme comfort dressing: long, unconstricting, with a certain enveloping clarity of purpose and a touch of the X Games. Black overcoats were cinched at the back with a leather clasp rendered just slightly askew, a single gold button glinting beneath the broad collar; ribbed skinny silk knit tubes in neon brights devolved at the knees into swirling strands of fringe (fringe being the single biggest trend in this city). It didn't all work ” fringed pants resembled costumes for a lost yeti and droopy balloon-shade crystal-covered frocks called to mind a deflated disco ball (they were better as jeans) ” but shearling coats and bags trailing more yard-long fat jellyfish tentacles were so squishably soft you wanted to either reach out and pet them or cuddle up inside one.

Carlo Perrotta,2/23/2020,theconversation,Coronavirus quarantine could spark an online learning boom,https://www.theconversation.com/coronavirus-quarantine-could-spark-an-online-learning-boom-132180,"The spread of the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 is a public health emergency with economic and social ramifications in China and across the world. While the impacts on business are well documented, education is also facing the largest disruption in recent memory.  Institutions around the world are responding to travel bans and quarantines with a shift to online learning. The crisis may trigger an online boom for education “ or at least make us more ready to cope with the next emergency. As many as 180 million Chinese students “ primary, secondary and tertiary “ are homebound or unable to travel. In China, the spring semester was originally scheduled to begin on February 17 but has now been  postponed indefinitely. In response, Chinese institutions are attempting to switch to online education on a massive scale. Effects of the epidemic are also being felt closer to home. Australian higher education is increasingly dependent on a steady flow of Chinese students, but the Australian government has restricted travel from China until at least 29 February. At the time of writing, thousands of students are still in limbo.  As a result, Australian higher education institutions are trying to boost their online capacity to deliver courses to stranded concerned students.  Some universities “ and some parts of universities “ are better prepared than others. While all universities use online learning management systems and videoconferencing technology to some degree, there are no mandatory standards for online education.  This makes for a huge variety among institutions and even between individual courses in how digitised they are. To make this worse, not all staff are familiar with (or feel positive about) distance or blended learning. Educational technology has historically struggled with large-scale adoption and much has been written about the cycles of boom and bust of the ed-tech industry. It may even be legitimate to ask whether adoption is a goal any longer for many in the industry.  Nowadays, a critical observer could be forgiven for thinking that the most successful ed-tech companies only pay lip service to mass adoption. Instead, their energies are firmly directed at the more remunerative game of (overinflated) start-up funding and selling. Yet visions of mass adoption are still what drives the volatile dynamics of ed-tech financing. Investors ultimately hope that an innovation will, at some point in the near future, be used by large numbers of students and teachers.   In 2014 Michael Trucano, a World Bank specialist on education and technology policy, described the importance of tipping points to push educational technology into the mainstream. Trucano suggested that epidemics (he talked about the 2003 SARS epidemic, but the argument applies to COVID-19) could be black swans. The term is borrowed from the American thinker Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who uses it to describe unanticipated events with profound consequences. During the SARS outbreak, according to Trucano, China was forced into boosting alternative forms of distance education. This led to pockets of deeper, more transformational uses of online tools, at least temporarily. The long-term effects are still unclear.  The current landscape of global digital education suggests COVID-19 may result in more robust capabilities in regions with enough resources, connectivity and infrastructure. However, it is also likely to expose chronic deficiencies in less prepared communities, exacerbating pre-existing divides. Investors appear to see this as a moment that could transform all kinds of online activity across the region. The stocks of Hong Kong-listed companies linked to online games, digital medical services, remote working and distance education have soared in recent days. Adding to the complexity, students do not always welcome digital education, and research shows they are less likely to drop out when taught using traditional face-to-face methods.  Indeed, studies on the effectiveness of virtual schools have yielded mixed results. A recent study focusing on the US recommended virtual schools be restricted until the reasons for their poor performance are better understood. Students may also oppose online learning because they perceive it as a sneaky attempt at forcing education down their throats. This may be what happened recently when DingTalk, a large Chinese messaging app, launched e-classes for schools affected by the coronavirus emergency. Unhappy students saw their forced vacation threatened and gave the app a bad rating on online stores in an attempt to drive it out of search results.  Perhaps this last story shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it does highlight the importance of emotional responses in attempts to scale up an educational technology.      The importance of distance education in an increasingly uncertain world of global epidemics and other dramatic disruptions (such as wars and climate-related crises) is without doubt. So-called developing countries (including large rural regions in the booming Indian and Chinese economies) can benefit greatly from it, as it can help overcome emergencies and address chronic teacher shortages.   The answer is not at all obvious. Take Australia, for example. Even if we assume the COVID-19 emergency will lead to some permanent change in how more digitally-prepared Australian universities relate to Chinese students, it's unclear what the change will look like. Alternatively, perhaps, the crisis might lead to a more robust response system. Universities might develop the ability to move online quickly when they need to and go back to normal once things blow over, in a world where global emergencies look increasingly like the norm.",business

Find out how one woman championed her health. Sybil Kretzmer, 68, came to Ultimate Performance Kensington in need of a health overhaul. Struggling with high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, arthritis and extra weight she was keen to shift, Sybil decided enough was enough. She had seen how her beloved husband own's health was deteriorating before her very eyes, as he was ferried to and from hospital, and she needed a positive distraction. At the time, my elderly husband was not well and was in and out of the hospital with accompanying mood swings and ever-increasing needs, Sybil began. My time in the gym was the best escape for my own mental and physical wellbeing. I always left completely physically spent and at the same time, euphoric and walking on air. Training in the gym three times per week, for a total of six months, Sybil has lost 8kg.

Even when I was young and skinny, I never had any arm definition. Dedicating herself to complete body workouts, Sybil would do squats, deadlifts and bench presses. She also did bicep curls, rope tricep extensions and literal raises. Losing over a stone had seen her drop down three dress sizes, and 12cm had fallen off her waist.

Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT] Waist circumference is paramount in measuring visceral fat levels, and Sybil's overall body fat had reduced from 35 percent to 23 percent. As this type of fat hides inside the body, wrapping itself around organs, measuring one's waist is a key indicator as to how much visceral fat a person is carrying. In women, a waist measuring 35 inches or more reflects dangerous levels of visceral fat within the body. Exercise and a healthy diet are the only proven ways to shift this toxic fat.  Sybil believes her exercise regime has been her fountain of youth. For me, it has been a lifesaver, she added. My friends are amazed at how well I look, how cheerful I am, and how much more energy and positive confidence I have. Additionally, Sybil has been able to come off her medication for blood pressure and cholesterol, which she is very pleased about. Delighted, Sybil said: My blood pressure and cholesterol counts came down to the point where I have been able to dispense with my former medications.  Her chronic hip and knee pain from arthritis has also subsided, which she credits to the combination of proper nutrition and strength training. Some side effects [of training] I didn't expect were the kind you don't see. I suffered from arthritis in my hip and knee so badly that, sometimes, I could barely turn over in my bed at night and, halfway through my programme, one day I just noticed I didn't have hip and knee pain anymore. I could spin around in the bed and not feel any pain. Impressed with her new physique, Sybil exclaimed: I have had to clear out my clothes closet from everything that no longer fits, and have had the great pleasure of buying a new, more fun looking wardrobe. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general

Speaking to CNBC's Hadley Gamble at the G-20 summit in Riyadh, Mnuchin said it was difficult to make strong predictions about the economic impact of the outbreak right now. ""I think we're going to need another three or four weeks to see how the virus reacts, until we really have good statistical data,"" he said. ""Although the rate the virus spreads at is quite significant, the mortality rate is quite small. It's something we're monitoring carefully, one of the discussions we're having here is that countries should be prepared, but I think we're at a point where it's too early to either say this is very concerning or it's not concerning."" Mnuchin also told CNBC he did not believe the Chinese government was aware of the coronavirus danger when a delegation traveled to the White House for the signing of the Sino-U.S. ""phase one"" trade deal in January. ""I think the Chinese government reacted much quicker than they have in previous situations,"" he said. ""There's no question that China's major focus is now controlling the virus and the approach of phase two (of the trade deal) will definitely slow down a little bit."" When asked if the U.S. had a backup plan in place in terms of a fiscal response to the virus outbreak, Mnuchin said there was ""no question about it."" However, he reiterated that it was too early to predict how the coronavirus “ formally named COVID-19 “ would affect the global economy. ""I think based upon everything we see now this will be manageable, but the situation can change. As I said, the good news is in another three or four weeks we'll have much better data,"" he told CNBC. At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee last week, Mnuchin insisted the coronavirus would not have an economic impact that lasted beyond 2020. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said at the G-20 summit on Saturday that the virus will likely shave 0.1 percentage points off global growth in 2020. Meanwhile, she said, Chinese growth would fall to 5.6%, which is 0.4 percentage points lower from the IMF's January outlook. ""I don't think people should be at the point where they're panicked ” on the other hand, it is concerning,"" Mnuchin told CNBC on Sunday. ""The good news is that most people who get this will survive it, there's obviously an area of the population that's at high risk, but people should be less focused on just the number of cases since it will travel ” the real impact is how many people does this ultimately impact in terms of death rates?"" In a major study on COVID-19 published this week, Chinese researchers estimated the death rate of the coronavirus was 2.3%, with the elderly and people who had pre-existing health conditions most at risk. According to the research, 81% of people who contracted COVID-19 only exhibited ""mild"" cold-like symptoms. However, some experts believe the total number of coronavirus cases could be much higher than the records show, which would make the mortality rate lower than currently estimated. U.S. health officials said Friday that they are preparing for the coronavirus to become a pandemic. China's National Health Commission on Saturday reported 97 new deaths from COVID-19 and 648 additional cases for Feb. 22, taking the total number of confirmed cases on the mainland up to 76,936.",finance
Claudia Cristoferi,2/23/2020,reuters,Belgian designer Raf Simons joins Prada as co-creative director,https://www.reuters.com/article/prada-designer-simons/update-1-belgian-designer-raf-simons-joins-prada-as-co-creative-director-idUSL5N2AN0CL,"Raf Simons will join Prada as co-creative director, marking the first time the Italian fashion house has hired an outsider to work with renowned head designer Miuccia Prada. Belgian-born Simons, 52, will join Prada on April 2, the group said in a statement. He was most recently creative director at Calvin Klein and before that at Christian Dior and Jil Sander, a brand which was then owned by Prada. After becoming one of Italy's best known fashion houses, Prada has struggled in recent years. A restructuring drive began to pay off in 2018 when sales returned to growth for the first time in four years thanks to a new strategy aimed at rejuvenating the label by renovating shops, launching new products and boosting online sales. But the brand is still not achieving the kind of double-digit sales growth seen at rivals like Moncler or Gucci, and the Hong Kong-listed group is often cited as a possible takeover target for bigger high-end houses. Miuccia Prada, 70, told a news conference in Milan that Simons' appointment was not intended to pave the way for a possible succession as Prada's top designer. Absolutely not, she said. I like working, don't make me older than I am. Miuccia Prada and Simons will have equal responsibilities for creative input and decision making, the group said. It's a challenge, we respect each other and we will see if we go somewhere, she said. Her husband Patrizio Bertelli, who is Prada's chief executive, said this was perhaps the first time that two star designers would be working together. Other new managers recently joined the group. Benedetta Petruzzo, previously at Gucci-owner Kering, has been appointed general manager at Miu Miu, Prada's brand aimed at younger shoppers. Christopher Bugg has joined from LVMH's top label Louis Vuitton as marketing and communication director for Asia. Sunday's news conference took place even as several designers, including Giorgio Armani, canceled their Milan fashion shows as Italy scrambles to contain the biggest outbreak of coronavirus in Europe. The health scare is set to hit revenues at luxury groups like Prada, which rely on Chinese nationals for more than a third of sales.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN",2/23/2020,cnn,Kobe farewell: On-court heroics provide only a glimpse of The Legend of the Black Mamba,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/us/kobe-bryant-memorial-service/index.html," From the time he began shooting make-believe game winners with his dad's rolled-up tube socks, Kobe Bean Bryant always wanted to ball. But his years on the court don't begin to sum up a life that spilled off the hardwood and into fans' hearts. The love was on full display Monday as fans and celebrities -- an A-list cast by even Hollywood standards -- packed the Staples Center to remember one of their own . Astronomers say when the biggest stars die they become supernovae, shining brighter than the Milky Way and capable of spurring the formation of other stars. Bryant was one such supernova. ""A 6-6 guard from Lower Merion High School"" in Pennsylvania, he joined the NBA in 1996 as a child. Over 20 seasons, he won five championship rings and forged an extraterrestrial reputation as a suffocating defender and one of the greatest scorers to ever bounce a Spalding. Fans will gather Monday at the Staples Center to remember Kobe and Gianna Bryant. Though his playing career ended in 2016 , his drive and passion never waned. In bidding the game he loved farewell, he wrote a short film that won an Oscar. He poured his retirement into his family , his production company and his Mamba Sports Academy, where the formation of young stars is part of its mission. Read More The trifecta forms the foundation of Bryant's legacy, which since his death has become its own universe. Meanwhile, the tears and remembrances -- from fans, fellow players and those he lifted up -- haven't stopped . His death stunned the world Bryant was stolen from this Earth on January 26 when a helicopter carrying him, daughter Gianna and seven others to a competition at his Newbury Park academy crashed into the Santa Monica Mountains in Calabasas. He'd planned to coach 13-year-old Gianna's team that day as part of his post-career goal of empowering the next generation and instilling in them his storied Mamba mentality.

""This can't be!"" morphed into ""How, how, how?"" Tears fell from Lower Merion to the streets of L.A. and beyond. Tributes arrived from Argentina, the Philippines, the Australian Open and all over Europe , Africa and Asia . In China, his death topped trends on Weibo, the social media platform, briefly outpacing posts about coronavirus . Perhaps not since Prince has the world so collectively and deeply mourned one of its beloved. As with Prince, the legacy Bryant leaves behind is complicated. It's easy to recall the times he shined, but there were also dark moments that left his faithful struggling to reconcile a dichotomy that's inherent in all humans but especially visible in those who spend their lives on stage. He was a baller in everything he did Every generation has its GOAT . They tend to go by one name. Before Kobe, the NBA had Kareem and Jordan. Now, LeBron . Of the 11 numbers the Lakers have retired -- among them, Kareem's, Worthy's, Wilt's, Magic's -- two belong to Bryant: the No. 8 he wore in his early days with the Lake Show and the No. 24 he resurrected from high school for the latter half of his pro career. In everything he did, Bryant was a baller, literally and figuratively -- from taking Brandy to prom to challenging His Airness Michael Jordan during his first All-Star Game to putting 60 on the Utah Jazz in his farewell performance. When he jumped from high school to the NBA in 1996, the path was uncharted for a guard. Few had achieved the feat without struggles -- Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins , Shawn Kemp and Kevin Garnett -- and they were all big men, or bigger than Bryant.

He trained relentlessly, whether shooting thousands of jumpers to perfect his stroke or running sand dunes to improve his conditioning. Anyone who witnessed him in person saw the product of his devotion, how he glided into position, feinted like an apparition and lobbed impossible jumpers that had no chance of dropping -- only they did. There were times he couldn't be covered with a fishing net. If you aren't part of Laker Nation, chances are he broke your heart more than once. In letting the game he loved go after 20 seasons, Bryant continued to exude an air of excellence, snaring an Oscar for his animated ode to the sport, ""Dear Basketball."" ""I did everything for you -- because that's what you do when someone makes you feel as alive as you've made me feel,"" he said in the short film. ""My heart can take the pounding, my mind can handle the grind, but my body knows it's time to say goodbye, and that's OK. I'm ready to let you go."" To some he was polarizing When a revered man dies, the lines between hagiography and history are blurred, but anyone who's lived a life worth living deserves to see his legacy fully explored. Humans struggle when their favorite people leave complex legacies. Look no further than Michael Jackson . They'll struggle again when Woody Allen, Roman Polanski and Mike Tyson meet their makers. Bryant's been remembered in glowing terms these past four weeks, but his shortcomings, too, are part of his lore, no matter how painful they are to remember. In what now looks like prescience, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne, who covered much of Bryant's career, said during a 2017 interview , ""I don't think Kobe was beloved in his time. He may be somebody who is remembered more fondly by history than he was in his time. The guy was very polarizing when he played.""

He was accused of quitting in the 2006 playoffs. Phil Jackson, one of basketball's most innovative minds, called him ""uncoachable."" He was fined for hurling a gay slur at a referee . In the middle of his career, he threatened to play for the loathed crosstown rival Clippers , or on Pluto, one being no worse than the other to Lakers fans. And, of course, there were the 2003 sexual assault allegations in Colorado , which ended with him being cleared of criminal charges. He and his accuser later settled a civil suit out of court. Any one of these things, let alone two or three, could have killed most mortals' careers -- forget their legacies. Yet in Bryant's oh-so-Kobe way, he dealt with them directly and effectively. But he never lacked confidence To bring up his perseverance in the face of shortcomings is not to castigate him in death but to cast light on important parts of his legacy. Yes, he silenced haters with Ws and trophies, but for someone with his drive and talent, that wasn't the difficult part. Even as a teenage newbie to The Association, he saw himself as ready for any challenge. Take his first All-Star Game in 1998, which he started despite not starting for the Lakers. Undeterred, he irked veteran (and future teammate) Karl Malone, telling him he didn't need his screens. It was seen as brash for a young buck, but everyone in Madison Square Garden knew what Bryant was up to: He wanted a piece of Jordan .

""Michael comes out and says, 'Not tonight, young fella. I'm bringing all my tricks.' Kobe comes back, he says, 'Michael, I'm stealing it. I'm taking it. I want the torch.'"" During a halftime interview, Bryant chalked it up to his desire to grow, telling reporter Jim Gray, ""Michael's a great player, one of the best players of all time. What better way to learn the game than going right at him?"" Over the years, many would attribute Bryant's cockiness to his confidence, his ruthlessness, his I'm-always-the-best-option philosophy. Handouts were never his thing. He'd take what he wanted. In one of his final interviews last year , he said he'd never join a so-called NBA superteam, even if it meant a sixth ring to tie Jordan. ""I like my rings the hard way,"" he said. ""I like fighting through them and earning them that way."" He built a new image in retirement The same determination would help him restore his image off the court. After issuing an apology for the gay slur, he became an advocate for the LGBT community, filming a local PSA and publicly chiding fans who would use ""gay"" as an insult . He was one of the first players to support Jason Collins coming out , prompting the NBA's first openly gay player to lament after Bryant's death , ""He was there for me & supported me when I needed it. He evolved so much as a human being, & his words meant the world to me."" Bryant also apologized to his accuser in the sexual abuse case, making a risky concession that he realized she did not consider their encounter consensual. That wasn't good enough for many people. It never will be. For his legions of fans, his words were sincere. His missteps were a product of his human fallibility, he'd say, telling Shelburne in his final year of hoops, ""We all say s*** that we shouldn't say. We all do things we shouldn't do.

He lent his wealth and star power to myriad causes, from cancer and natural disaster relief to after-school programs and opportunities for inner-city kids. That's not to mention the more than 200 dreams he fulfilled for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, including taking a rare beating in a game of H-O-R-S-E . He held the notion, rare among pro athletes, that his vocation was just a game and his true reach would be realized later, away from the cameras and spectators. In October, during his last interview with Los Angeles Times columnist Arash Markazi , he said of his Mamba Academy's role in how he's remembered, ""If we do it the right way, (we'll) be known for more of what we do after than what we did during.""

Mnuchin warned earlier this month that U.S. growth may not hit Trump's pledged 3% growth in GDP (gross domestic product) in 2020. Speaking to CNBC at the G-20 Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday, Mnuchin said disruptions at Boeing could cause a 50 basis point drag on growth, compounded by General Motors strikes and the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ""But the real impact in terms of the American economy, wages are going up, more jobs are being created and more people are coming back into the workforce than ever before,"" Mnuchin told CNBC's Hadley Gamble.

Gary Jones,2/23/2020,express,BIG PS5 release date and price is a great sign for PS4 gamers,https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/1246121/PS5-price-release-date-good-news-PS4," Analysts are predicting early success for Sony PS5 console when it launches later in 2020. Millions could pick up one of the new consoles following its release date, combining to bring in a much-needed lift in sales. The PlayStation 4 remains the most popular console of this generation, and it will only be the Nintendo Switch which might be able to surpass its 100+ million units sold. But Sony will be keen to avoid any issues with pricing or supply numbers, as this could change things significantly leading up to launch. And an analyst from Japanese research firm Ace Research Institute claims the PS5 could sell millions of units by early 2021. According to a report from Tom's Hardware, Hideki Yasuda is backing Sony to sell six million PS5 and PS4 consoles by March 31, 2021. That number includes both consoles but it still suggests that there is plenty of people ready to snap up a PS5. And this would be just the first phase in a busy period for Sony, who would then go on to see the PS5 sell another 15 million units by March 2022. If the tech giant manages to pull off these kinds of numbers, the PlayStation 5 will have to be hailed as a hardware success.  But the report also comes with some ending advice which should be considered. This prediction shared by ARI was posted before the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.   The disruption in the supply chain could heavily affect how many consoles are available to both Microsoft and Sony. Several high-profile events have been hit by the outbreak, with Sony pulling out of PAX East this month. Sony told fans in February: Sony Interactive Entertainment made the decision to cancel its participation at PAX East in Boston this year due to increasing concerns related to COVID-19 (also known as novel coronavirus). We felt this was the safest option as the situation is changing daily. We are disappointed to cancel our participation in this event, but the health and safety of our global workforce is our highest concern. Event organisers Penny Arcade had this to say about PAX East following the news that Sony would not be attending. They told fans in a letter: PAX East 2020 will take place as scheduled with enhanced cleaning and sanitization across the show, including adhering to the recommendations set forth in the U.S. EPA's Emerging Pathogen Policy regarding cleaning disinfectants effective against the COVID-19 virus.  We are working closely with the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center and following local, state and federal public health guidelines, including those issued by the CDC.  While we are saddened that Sony will no longer have a presence at PAX East 2020, we look forward to welcoming our friends at Sony to future PAX events and are focused on making PAX East 2020 a successful and enjoyable event for all attendees and exhibitors. So while Sony currently has the player numbers to make the PS5 a success, there are still a number of factors in play that could affect console sales in the early months. As mentioned above, Sony has not confirmed the price the PS5 will be when it hits shelves. And as TechRadar points out, the retail costs of the next-gen of gaming machines could have a big effect on sales. Shortages leading up to the release of the PS5 could drive up the price, which looks to be a deciding factor for many. Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon highlighted as much in a recent poll he conducted on Twitter. Over 50,000 votes were cast in the poll which asked what was the most important factor between Affordable price, Better Graphics, Exclusive Games and Backwards Compatibility. Over 37.5% supported the affordable price option as the most important factor, followed by backwards compatibility and better graphics. Boon shared the results and signed off by adding: 50,000+ of you have spoken and PRICE seems to be the most important factor for Next Gen consoles. I'd have guessed Exclusive Games would be higher than 13%. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general

Sophie Barley said: ""It's hard to explain, but there is sand everywhere - indoors and out."" She said sand in the air has created a ""constant haze"" leaving the streets ""deserted"". Many frustrated British holidaymakers have been forced to stay an extra two or more days due to the conditions.  One British holidaymaker Greg Horsman, 29, was on holiday with his girlfriend and his friends on a Tui cruise and was due to fly home to Manchester on Saturday evening. He told PA: It's frustrating. We're just ready to be home. Last night we were in the airport for five hours and I was frustrated because Tui couldn't help us or do anything until the airport declared that they were closed which they did at 10.30pm. The Canary Government tonight confirmed all passengers unable to fly are being put up overnight in hotels.

So far today, about 360 flights have been affected and another 500 will be disrupted by the aftermath of the storm. At a press conference tonight, president of the Canary Islands, Γngel VΓ­ctor Torres stressed that only Tenerife South is not allowing operations of departure or arrival at this time. It is hoped that Tenerife south will start operating again within the next few hours. Tenerife and Gran Canaria services are also having to combat the outbreak of a number of fires, currently being tackled in various locations across the destinations. The Canary president said at a press conference tonight: ""We are under the influence of four phenomena with the alert for strong winds, the calima, coastal phenomena and forest fires. All the mechanisms required by the protocol have been activated. We have had fires in Gran Canaria in two municipalities and in six municipalities in Tenerife.  The president revealed the canary islands has 90 members of the UME (Emergency Military Unit), 100 Civil Guard agents in Gran Canaria, and another 100 and more than 50 of the UME in Tenerife working to combat the flames. In addition, the president stressed are more than 90 troops on standby in Seville to move to the islands if the situation worsens. He added: The wind has caused the worst of the fires, in addition to the temperature rise in the calima. All the operations have been terrestrial due to the difficulties to operate by air for the calima. The level of both fires is 1 at the moments. We hope that this condition does not increase in the two islands and therefore will get better in the next few hours.""

Guardian staff,2/23/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: South Korea placed on 'red alert' as fifth person dies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/coronavirus-south-korea-reports-123-new-cases-and-two-more-deaths,"South Korea's president Moon Jae-in has placed the country on red alert after it reported its fifth death and more than 123 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of infected to 556. As the nation struggled on Sunday to contain the deadly Covid-19 outbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as a very important moment, the news agency Yonhap said. The government would bolster its fight against the virus by raising the alert level one notch to the highest of red, he told an emergency meeting of agencies in Seoul on Sunday. The president said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take unprecedented powerful measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by regulations. Of the 123 new cases, 75 are related to the Shincheonji church in the country's fourth-largest city of Daegu and a neighbouring hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers have been screened for the virus. It came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country's management of the outbreak. In South Korea, the government has tried to contain the outbreak by declaring Daegu and its adjacent county Cheongdo special care zones. But that did not stop the number of infections more than doubling in a single day on Saturday. So far South Korea had released 18 fully recovered novel coronavirus patients from hospitals, the KCDC said. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 6,039 on Sunday morning, the KCDC said. The country has tested 22,633 suspected cases; 16,038 tested negative. South Korea confirmed its first new coronavirus case from a Chinese woman from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, on 20 January. The country's 31st patient, a probable super spreader, had attended the Shincheonji church's worship services. In a rare public message on Saturday night, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, reassured people that the virus could be contained if the public cooperated with the government's instructions. On Sunday Daegu's mayor, Kwon Young-jin, advised locals to stay indoors and said: The crisis level of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province is grave. He asked all Shincheonji members with symptoms to come forward and be tested. Hiding is not the answer, he said. If you hide, it could hurt your health, your family's health, and will not help in the early cessation of the situation. China's death toll from the virus rose to 2,442 on Sunday after the government said 97 more people had died, all but one in the epicentre of Hubei province. The national health commission also confirmed another 648 new cases. Most of the deaths and new infections were in Hubei's provincial capital, Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December. China's total infections reached 76,936, the commission said in its daily update. The coronavirus has spread to more than 25 countries and is causing mounting alarm due to outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. China's numbers of daily new infections are well down from the outbreak's early height. But China has sowed confusion about the data by repeatedly changing its counting methods. On Saturday the US state department raised its travel advisory to South Korea. US citizens were asked to exercise increased caution when travelling to South Korea, where sustained community spread has been reported. Sustained community spread means that people in South Korea have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known, and the spread is ongoing, the department said on its website. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued an alert level 2 travel notice, saying older adults and those with chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel. Britain has also advised its nationals against all but essential travel to Daegu and Cheongdo, and Israel refused to allow non-Israelis to disembark from a plane that departed from South Korea on Saturday.",general
Harriet Mallinson,2/23/2020,express,Cruise ship code word revealed by ex crew member - something gross has happened in the poo,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/cruise/1244497/cruise-ship-code-word-cruises-crew-swimming-pool-holidays,"  Cruises see holidaymakers enjoy their stay onboard in floating hotels. There is always plenty to do onboard the cruise ship and there are various stops at ports of call. There is a cruise to suit nearly every budget and demand making sure travellers' needs are always met. However, it's a very different lifestyle onboard for those who work on the ships. Crew have to put in long hours and live on the vessels for long periods of time. Express.co.uk spoke to one former cruise crew member about life onboard cruises. Paul - who did not wish to divulge his surname - revealed the code words they would use. Utilising codes means the crew can communicate without worrying the passengers if they hear the conversation. One unofficial code word, in particular, meant something very unpleasant indeed had happened. READ MORE: Coronavirus cruise: Diamond Princess reaches the end of quarantine  Paul shared what happened when a child did a poo in one of the swimming pools. We made one up, Code Brown - it was for when kids took a dump in the pool, he told Express.co.uk. The ex cruise worker explained that the ensuing hours were pretty ghastly for the staff. Four hours of clean up for that. Glad I didn't have to do the cleaning, said Paul. Other code words are used for even greater emergencies. The safety ones are pretty universal [across cruise lines], Paul explained. Bravo Bravo for man overboard, Alpha for fire etc. Certain cruise lines also use the term Red Parties if there is a fire, he added. Some terms were used between staff in a more humorous vein. Paul revealed they had one very unusual code word for guests.  Cones was the term we used for guests, he said. Not sure why though. The unusual code word is also referenced by former senior cruise ship office Jay Herring in his book The Truth About Cruise Ships. He shared some insight into why cones came about to refer to passengers. Herring also explained that sexual relations between crew and passengers were referred to as coning when he worked on board.  Even though it was company policy not to sleep with the passengers, it happened so often that we had a nickname for it, he wrote. It was called coning,' from the infinitive to cone.' Passengers were referred to as cones.' Some say it's because, during boat drill, the passengers look like the neon orange traffic cones. But others say it's from the 1993 movie Coneheads where, just like the aliens in the movie, passengers ate everything in sight. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general

Get your BoF Professional Cheat Sheet. THE CHEAT SHEET The Talk of Paris Fashion Week: Prada and the Coronavirus Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, the co-creative directors of Prada | Source: Courtesy Paris Fashion Week usually commands the fashion world's attention for its nine-day run, but the outside world is threatening to overshadow the proceedings. Giorgio Armani'sΒ last-minuteΒ decision to stage his Milan show in an empty room, following reports of coronavirus outbreaks in the region, has not been repeated by other designersΒ in Milan. However, the virus had alreadyΒ cast something of a pallΒ over fashion month, given the absence of Chinese editors, buyers, influencers and designers who have played an increasingly important role in the proceedings. Many of the brands showing may also be uncertain aboutΒ who will buy their clothesΒ as Chinese retail sales have plunged and fewer tourists are visiting Europe's luxury boutiques. Then there's the newsΒ todayΒ that Simons is joining Prada, where he'll serve as co-creative director alongside Miuccia Prada. This unusual arrangement is guaranteed to shake up the luxury landscape. The Bottom Line: Β As for the shows themselves, 2019 LVMH Prize winner Thebe Magugu stages his first runway in Paris, and Kenzo's 50th anniversary will be marked by the debut of Felipe Oliveira Baptista's debut collection for the label. The Bid to Take Saks' Owner Private: Take Two Signage outside the Saks women's store at Brookfield Place in New York, which closed in 2019 | Source: Allison Joyce/Bloomberg via Getty Images Department stores would greatly prefer to battle the retail apocalypse behind closed doors. Neiman Marcus told US regulators last year it would stop issuing quarterly updates on its operations, and the Nordstrom family has repeatedly tried and failed to take the company private. Richard Baker, chairman of Hudson's Bay Co., is likely to succeed where Nordstrom failed. One can spin the sudden mania for privacy as a necessary step to radically reinvent the ailing department store model without needing to fulfil investor demands for predictable quarterly growth. Of course, if there is a plan to reinvent the ailing department store model, the reigning incumbents, both public and private, are keeping it close to the vest. The Bottom Line:Β Β For Saks, refurbished stores and a renewed push into the off-price market likely won't be enough. Barring a sudden turnaround in sales, expect more drastic measures, such as a merger with a rival, or finding more-profitable uses for HBC's considerable real-estate holdings. A Trio of Fashion Start-Ups Report Results A graphic in The RealReal's Soho store illustrates how resale can encourage circularity. | Source: Courtesy Though Revolve, The RealReal and Farfetch are very different companies, investors have treated the trio roughly the same, which is to say, skeptically. Revolve has a strong brand and knows how to work the influencer economy like no other, helping it rise above the fray on Instagram. But it's also an apparel retailer, and suffers the same inventory issues and slim margins as its more-traditional peers. At least Revolve is profitable. The RealReal seems to have weathered questions about counterfeits on its resale platform and is making headway in convincing luxury brands to engage with the secondhand market. But it is still struggling to make the case that it can operate in the black. Similarly, Farfetch's most recent quarter was once again marked by a flurry of deals and new features, welcoming Opening Ceremony into the fold and introducing a new series of exclusive drops. But the luxury marketplace's streak of losses is expected to continue for at least another year. The Bottom Line:Β As the recent troubles at Outdoor Voices show, fashion start-ups can wow investors for a time with innovative designs and business models. But ultimately, they must show they can turn a profit as well. SUNDAY READING Professional Exclusives You May Have Missed: The Week Ahead wants to hear from you!

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,2/23/2020,bbc,Coronavirus: Russia denies spreading US conspiracy on social media,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51599009?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story,"Russia has flatly denied allegations that it is spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak on social media. US officials said Russian-linked accounts were making unfounded claims that America started the outbreak. Thousands of profiles on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram were peddling the theory, the officials said. Responding to the allegations on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry dismissed them as ""fake"". ""This is a deliberately false story,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russia's Tass news agency. Over 2,000 people have died, mostly in China, and more than 76,000 people are confirmed to have the new coronavirus. The virus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. Earlier, a senior US State Department official, Philip Reeker, said ""malign"" Russian actors were attempting to sow disinformation about the origin of the coronavirus. One conspiracy theory - circulating online in several languages - alleges the virus is an attempt to wage ""economic war on China"". ""By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response,"" Phillip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, told AFP news agency. The posts also accused Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates of involvement in the outbreak. According to AFP news agency, the disinformation campaign was identified by US monitors in mid-January, shortly after the third death from the new coronavirus was announced. ""In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy web sites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,"" said Lea Gabrielle, the head of the State Department's Global Engagement Centre. The accounts had been previously identified for sharing Russian-backed messages on events such as demonstrations in Chile and the war in Syria. It is alleged that the accounts are run by humans. The US State Department said the claims were making some countries in Africa and Asia suspicious of the Western response. Russian TV has also been reporting that Western elites, especially the US, are to blame. One of the country's main TV networks, Channel One, has launched a regular slot devoted to coronavirus conspiracy theories on its main evening news programme. Conspiracy theories have also featured heavily on the Channel One's main political talk show. It suggested that various Western actors - pharmaceutical companies, the US or its agencies - are somehow involved in helping to create or spread the virus, or at least in spreading panic about it.",general
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,2/23/2020,bbc,The potential diplomatic impact of the coronavirus crisis,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51577685,"As China struggles to contain the spread of the epidemic, the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis is already upon us. Small numbers of foreign nationals are already ill. Governments whose citizens abroad have been unlucky to be caught up are weighing up the dilemmas of repatriation and isolating those who may be carriers of the virus once home. Some countries have closed their borders to Chinese nationals altogether. And, in some quarters, there has - perhaps inevitably - been an unpleasant and quite unfair stigmatisation of China and the Chinese. The immediate economic impact of the crisis is also apparent. In the first place those industries that depend upon the movement of goods and people - tourism, airlines, the operators of cruise ships and commercial shipping lines - are already suffering. The crisis has thrown into stark relief the global supply chain behind many of the products we take for granted. The supply of mobile phones, microprocessors, spare parts for the motor industry may all be interrupted. Even the service sector, for example foreign universities who have set up off-shoots in China, will find its income threatened. How long this will all last is impossible to say. So too its ramifications for Beijing. It depends upon how the epidemic plays out. As Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Washington think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes: ""The impact on perception of Xi Jinping at home and abroad will depend on the duration of the virus and its impact on the Chinese economy."" ""If the Chinese Communist Party can control the spread of the epidemic and end the crisis,"" she argues, ""few people inside China will continue to criticise the party for its initial slow response and efforts to cover up the outbreak."" Many countries who have sought investment from China as part of its Belt and Road initiative will continue to do so, she told me. ""They'll continue to want Chinese loans for infrastructure projects since there aren't other sources of financing."" But what may be the lasting impact of the crisis? To what extent could it change perceptions of China and especially of President Xi Jinping himself and indeed the whole direction in which he is taking his country? How could the fallout from the coronavirus impact the key relationship between Beijing and Washington? And with clear signs of a technological ""cold war"" already developing between the US and China - the battle over 5G and artificial intelligence - could the tensions surrounding the virus outbreak make things worse? So first of all what does the crisis tell us about China itself? Elizabeth Economy, director for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, says that inside China there are essentially two distinct narratives. ""The first, which is already being advanced by China's diplomatic corps, is that China has taken extraordinary measures to contain the virus - both for the sake of its own people and as a gift to the rest of the world,"" she says. These actions, they say, ""are enabled by China's particular top-down authoritarian model"". But then there is a second narrative, Economy argues, that says, ""China lost precious time in addressing the crisis because of its political system and its determination to silence independent voices."" ""Also under Xi Jinping, local officials have become more afraid to acknowledge that things are not going well. This too has hampered an effective response."" As a long-time China-watcher, Elizabeth Economy told me that what she found especially concerning was ""that even in the wake of Dr Li Wenliang's death, the Communist Party continues to hunt down independent voices"". Dr Li was seen by many in China as a whistleblower and hero; the man who first highlighted the threat posed by the Wuhan virus outbreak. He himself succumbed to the disease. ""One might have hoped,"" says Economy, ""that his death - and the popular response to it - would have signalled to the Chinese leadership the value of transparency and a more open civil society in mounting an effective response to a nationwide crisis."" So much for perceptions inside China itself, but what about the rest of the world? Elizabeth Economy says that she does not think that the coronavirus will change perceptions of the Chinese government, rather she argues, ""it will simply feed into pre-existing beliefs. Supporters will stress the impressive mobilisation of resources, while detractors will focus on the lack of transparency and concern over the accuracy of Chinese information."" On the economic front though it could be significant, even just by throwing into stark relief things that we already know. The disease outbreak has underscored the significance of China to the global economy and the importance of diversified supply chains. And this, according to Elizabeth Economy, ""will perhaps encourage more companies not to place too much of their manufacturing in China or rely too heavily on the Chinese consumer market."" At the recent annual security conference that I attended in Munich, the shadow of the coronavirus and its likely impact upon the medium- and long-term relationship between Washington and Beijing overshadowed much of the debate. Ian Bremmer, founder and chief strategist of Eurasia Group, the leading political risk and consulting firm, told me that the crisis had the potential to significantly re-shape the US-China business relationship, though not exactly for the reasons that many people might think. ""US companies,"" he told me, ""have long been thinking about reducing supply chain exposure to China given increasing trade hostilities, in addition to a Chinese labour force that is increasingly expensive and inefficient."" With coronavirus, he explains ""US companies may now have the excuse they need to actually make that move. That's obviously an extreme example, but it's a very real prospect down the line, the longer coronavirus continues to cause mayhem."" At the very least, he argues, ""the coronavirus makes it highly unlikely that China will be able to fully implement the 'Phase One' trade deal it just signed with the US, further intensifying the trend of decoupling between the US and China."" Bonnie Glaser agrees that China will have difficulty meeting the commitments it made in the ""Phase One"" deal. But, she argues, ""the US will likely cut Beijing some slack"". ""With his eye on re-election,"" she notes, ""President Trump will celebrate his achievement and seek to preserve good relations with Xi, while pledging to make more progress in 'Phase Two'. 2020,"" she says, ""is going to be a year of treading water."" Here we see the crucial inter-section of economics, diplomacy and domestic politics. Each has a part to play in the relationship between Washington and Beijing, but the salience or relative weight of each factor varies depending upon the circumstances. As Ian Bremmer notes, ""for the time being, Trump has been quite positive about President Xi's handling of the situation"". But, he argues, ""that's largely been the result of Trump being relatively shielded from the fallout of the coronavirus crisis himself"". All this could quite easily change, Bremmer asserts. ""Should the coronavirus start having real economic impact in the US - and in an election year no less - we're more likely to see President Trump go after Xi much more aggressively. ""And this won't just be empty rhetoric. Given the bipartisan hawkishness on China that already exists more broadly in the US these days"", he concludes, ""a Trump decision to turn on Xi would have real impact on the relationship between the world's only two economic superpowers."" This bipartisan hostility to China was clearly in evidence at the Munich conference. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, headed a large congressional delegation and she was outspoken against the Chinese, especially concerning technological rivalry. But to my ear this wasn't just about business or technology. There was a clear ideological element to the debate. Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, preferred to refer to the actions of the ""Chinese Communist Party"" rather than ""China"". Thus the coronavirus crisis has the potential to dramatically worsen the already deteriorating climate between Washington and Beijing. And this could have much broader consequences, not least for the Europeans (or indeed for Washington's Asian allies), who will be caught in the middle. I asked Ian Bremmer if what we saw in Munich - bullish interventions on China from Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Esper - amounted to the declaration of a new global ""high-technology cold war"" between the US and China. ""Close to it,"" was his answer. But he stressed that the Europeans had no interest in getting caught in the middle of this brewing high-tech cold war. ""Indeed,"" he noted, ""it's the first time in the transatlantic relationship you've ever seen the Americans and the Europeans in such disagreement over what their respective top national security concerns should be."" This in turn could have a profound impact on the already somewhat strained relationship between the US and some of its Nato partners. ""As much as the Americans may be gearing up for a 'cold war' vis-Γ -vis China on tech,"" Bremmer told me, ""at the moment it's looking increasingly like a bilateral 'cold war' rather than a global one. And as the Americans begin to actually pivot to Asia on security matters and the Europeans don't, it's also looking likely that there are even rougher waters ahead for the transatlantic relationship.""

"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-giuffrida,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laurencochrane",2/23/2020,theguardian,Italy imposes draconian rules to stop spread of coronavirus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread,"Italian authorities have implemented draconian measures to try to halt the coronavirus outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas, as a third person was confirmed to have died on Sunday. The number of cases of the virus in the country has risen to 152. Police are patrolling 11 towns “ mostly in the Lombardy region, where the first locally transmitted case emerged “ that have been in lockdown since Friday night. The latest victim died in the Lombardy city of Crema. The woman had been admitted to oncology, so was in a very compromised situation and also had coronavirus, said Giulio Gallera, the Lombardy health and welfare minister. Measures were stepped up after a 78-year-old Italian man infected with the virus died in the Veneto region on Friday. A postmortem performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy on Saturday confirmed that she was also infected, but it is unclear if the virus caused her death. The woman is reported to have been recovering from pneumonia and had visited the emergency unit of a hospital in Codogno, near Lodi, a few hours after the first man confirmed to have contracted the disease, a 38-year-old, had passed through. Angelo Borelli, the head of Italy's civil protection service, said so far 152 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the country, including the three people who have died, an Italian man who recovered, and a Chinese couple being treated for the illness in Rome. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Austria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, Italy, to Munich in Germany was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said. About 50,000 residents in the towns under lockdown have been told to stay home and avoid social contact, while schools, shops and businesses “ apart from chemists “ have been closed and festivities and sporting events including Serie A football matches and the final two days of the Venice carnival have been cancelled. Schools and universities will also be closed for at least a week in Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, while similar measures have been taken in Liguria and Alto Adige. Milan fashion week has also been affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room. The decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani's] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces, said a press release. Models still presented the clothes, with the show streamed on the brand's website, as well as on Instagram and Facebook. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: We have adopted a decree to protect the health of Italians, which is our priority and which ranks first in the list of constitutional values. He urged people to have faith in the political and scientific institutions, which are doing everything possible. Locals wearing face masks were already lined up outside a supermarket in the town of Casalpusterlengo, a 10-minute drive from Codogno, on Sunday morning. Shoppers were made to wait, then allowed to enter in groups of 40 inside the store to stock up on provisions. Although one woman in the crowd downplayed the virus, telling other shoppers it was not fatal if properly treated, others were less sanguine. It's inhuman, one man who gave his name as Sante told AFP. Fighting over four sandwiches is just disgusting. Hundreds of colleagues who worked with the first infected man, a researcher at Unilever, were being tested but it was still unclear whom he had contracted the illness from. The man, who was in intensive care, was initially thought to have caught the virus after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China, but the colleague tested negative. Unfortunately, the person who was considered to be patient zero' was not, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. We need to look elsewhere. We are following two hypotheses, and we will try to understand if one of the two is correct. The 38-year-old recently took part in a number of races. His pregnant wife is also infected, as is a person who went running with him. Three other cases in Lombardy are elderly people who frequented a bar in Codogno owned by the father of the man who went running with the 38-year-old. The man who died in Veneto was diagnosed with pneumonia a few weeks ago but had not travelled to China nor come into contact with anyone who had. Unfortunately, we haven't managed to limit the spread of the virus, said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, which has also closed. And we need to face the fact that it is spreading quickly. At first, we thought that the virus was only abroad, but now it is also in Italy. People should try not to panic but limiting the spread is, in part, down to our behaviour. Those who have been in contact with someone infected must isolate themselves. Crowded places should also be avoided; sacrifices need to be made to try to overcome the virus. The first two cases of the virus in Italy were those of a Chinese couple from Wuhan who arrived in the country on 23 January. They were being treated at Spallanzani hospital for infectious diseases in Rome. A group they were travelling with were released from hospital this month after being quarantined for 14 days. A third case in Rome was that of an Italian man who had caught the virus in China. Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, where fashion week wraps up on Monday, asked for all schools to be closed for a week. It's a prudent measure, then we'll see if a week is sufficient. There are so many events in the city. I don't imagine everything shutting down and being cancelled, but events that are not obligatory and which can be postponed, should be. Ά This article was amended on 24 February 2020.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/editorial,2/23/2020,theguardian,The Guardian view on Iran's elections: a closing door,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/23/the-guardian-view-on-irans-elections-a-closing-door,"Iran's election on Friday was a blow to moderates, a disappointment for conservative rulers and bad news for the region too. The result was largely ordained before anyone could cast a ballot. Hardliners appear to have swept the parliamentary contest “ taking all 30 seats in Tehran “ because the authorities ensured that they would. The Guardian Council, which is loosely under the control of the supreme leader, had disqualified around half of the thousands of candidates for the 290-seat body, including 90 serving members. While parliament's powers are limited, it can impede the president and shape the political environment; with a presidential race due next year, the result sets a course for conservative control of every branch of government “ as seen during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's grim tenure. Yet the outcome of Friday's poll was far from the endorsement sought. Despite the supreme leader's exhortations to vote, the extension of polling hours and the anger engendered by the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Quds force, a usually active electorate stayed away. Turnout stood at just 42.5%, the first time it has dipped below 50% since the 1979 revolution; in Tehran it was just 25%. Though Ayatollah Khamenei blamed Iran's enemies for exaggerating the threat of the new coronavirus, it is not surprising that so many voters saw little point in participating. Not only were their candidates struck from this contest, but they have little to show for supporting them in the past. In 2013, the moderate Hassan Rouhani won the presidency pledging to end his country's isolation and revive its economy. The resulting nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) ensured a landslide when he stood again in 2017. Yet the opposition he has faced internally, the moderates' own shortcomings and, above all, the Trump administration's hostility have left the country in desperate straits. The unilateral US withdrawal from the JCPOA and its reimposition of sanctions are strangling the country's economy: the World Bank estimates that it shrank by almost 9% last year. Inflation and unemployment have soared. Europe's efforts to shore up the deal have yet to offer relief; they must continue. The frustrations found an outlet in November's brutally suppressed protests “ the third outbreak of unrest in as many years “ and have only grown since then. The shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane, which Iran denied for days before admitting responsibility, prompted fresh protests and further exposed the rifts between and within the country's institutions. Now a coronavirus outbreak, the deadliest outside China, is spreading in a country where the health system is already under immense strain due to sanctions. It will also deepen economic woes: on Sunday, Pakistan and Turkey announced they were closing their borders and Afghanistan said it was suspending all travel to and from the country. Domestic incompetence and corruption have unquestionably contributed to the hopelessness that so many Iranians feel today. But it is above all the Trump administration's choices “ in walking out of the JCPOA, imposing punishing sanctions and assassinating General Suleimani, arguably the second most powerful man in the country after the supreme leader “ which have tightened the grip of hardliners and strengthened the belief that cultivating its nuclear programme and its proxies is a better bet than counting on meetings with western diplomats. A vital opportunity has been squandered, and Iranians are paying the price. Others may do so too.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/emma-graham-harrison,2/23/2020,theguardian,China encourages citizens to return to work as coronavirus hits economy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/scared-china-workers-halt-firms-return-to-business,"The Chinese authorities are trying to usher the country back to work, a month after announcing the unprecedented quarantine of millions of people. But they face a difficult balancing act between containing the virus and supporting a faltering economy. Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, have been the focus of disease prevention efforts. over the last four weeks. As the death toll climbed to more than 2,000 worldwide, and infections to over 75,000, the vast majority of cases were still inside that quarantined zone. But the disease had spread far across the country before Hubei was sealed off, and some of the worst-affected places are the manufacturing and economic centres that power China's economy. Southern Guangdong province, just across from Hong Kong and home to international giants such as Apple supplier Foxconn, is the second-worst affected province after Hubei, with 1,339 cases of the coronavirus confirmed and five deaths. Eastern Zhejiang, near Shanghai, is the fourth most seriously hit, with 1,205 cases by , although only one death. It is also the base for companies including the hugely influential Alibaba, China's answer to Amazon and eBay. Those total numbers of infections are far above the 639 cases registered across all of China on 23 January, when Hubei was put on sudden lockdown. The situations are not directly comparable; coronavirus had been spreading almost unchecked in Wuhan for weeks before the quarantine, and overwhelmed hospitals appear to have sent patients home, only to spread the disease. Authorities in other areas started tracking cases much earlier and have better resources to isolate and treat those who fall sick, something reflected in a much lower death rate. The speed of the disease's spread is perhaps not surprising given Wuhan's position as a regional economic hub, with links to other key centres, and the fact that the coronavirus has proved contagious in the early days of infection when patients have few symptoms, making it hard to identify carriers as clusters spread. Yet China cannot afford for its factories to sit idle, or its restaurants and shops to stay empty indefinitely. Authorities were already worried about faltering growth after last year saw the slowest rate of expansion in almost three decades; GDP growth had not slid so low since 1990, when China was isolated in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. An influential Chinese economist has already warned that the coronavirus crisis could slice a full percentage point off growth this year. So authorities are trying to balance two unfathomable risks “ of either fuelling the coronavirus by pushing too much for normal routines, or paving the way for the collapse of their local economy by keeping everything on lockdown. Many small and medium companies in particular are already hovering on the brink, and a wave of bankruptcies is expected. Retail and hospitality companies expected bumper sales over the lunar new year, and even factories that closed for the holiday expected to reopen in early February. This year our company isn't talking about the question of profit, Guangdong Meijie Group chief executive Luo Xiaohua told China Business News. Our main objective is just to survive. In Shenzhen, the border city that has come to rival Hong Kong, businesses have been told they can resume work immediately if they have virus control measures that include disinfecting, giving employees at least two masks a day, making temperature checks, and having their plans approved by local officials. There is already a gap between regulation and reality, however. We started today, but the boss only gave us one mask when we all know he's supposed to give out two, said one 52-year-old woman employed at a Shenzhen factory making plastic items such as skateboard wheels, cups and toy parts. My husband, who works at a restaurant near here, is also only getting one mask per day, she added, giving only her last name, Xiao, over fears of being fired or getting her boss into trouble. Getting employees back to their desk is a further problem for companies that are ready to re-open. Xiao, a migrant from Sichuan, said only about 20 of the factory's 50-strong workforce had returned from other parts of China. Overall, less than a third of the country's nearly 300 million migrant workers, who power everything from factories to courier networks and restaurants, have returned to the cities from holidays in their home towns and villages, the country's transport minister said last week. Some are worried about the virus, others unsure if their jobs will be open, but many are struggling to get transport with strict new restrictions meant to slow the spread of the disease. Train tickets have been limited so that passengers aren't carried in close proximity, and many bus services have been cancelled. To try to counteract this, the Zhejiang province has provided 100 million yuan (Β£11m) of subsidies to help people return, new tax policies to support business, and has even hired cars, buses and trains to transport employees back to work. One worker from the tech hub of Hangzhou, in a county where there have been 169 confirmed cases, said transport was less of a problem in an economy focused on higher skilled labour “ we don't have as many migrant workers in Hangzhou “ but government efforts to get people back were encouraging. In the decision to get back to work, officials may also be weighing the accelerating spread of the coronavirus elsewhere as cases appear across the Middle East, and numbers grow closer to home in neighbouring Asian nations. Many infectious disease experts now believe it is likely to become a pandemic, and even the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the window for containment is narrowing'. If quarantine and business shutdowns can't stop Covid-19 in the way it halted Sars in 2003, its heavy cost on local economies “ and populations “ look far less defensible, both in China and beyond. Yes, we want to stop (the) spread, but must start caring a lot more (about the) plight of over 50 million people in Hubei, said Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University and Professor of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Twitter. Ongoing threat to physical and mental health in Hubei is unconscionable “ (people are) trapped together and fearful. Moreover, once quarantine ends, people in Hubei will flee. During the influenza pandemic of 1918, quarantines delayed the spread but over time made little difference.",general

The world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the coronavirus, according to experts, who warn that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it, after major outbreaks forced Italy and Iran to introduce stringent internal travel restrictions and South Korea's president placed the country on red alert. Some of the countries most affected by the virus are scrambling to halt its progress two days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said the international community needed to act quickly before the narrowing window of opportunity closed completely. With almost 78,000 cases of Covid-19 now confirmed across the globe, experts say the situation will soon reach a critical threshold. A Queensland man has admitted to splashing petrol on his former partner and threatening to burn their house down, in a court case successfully prosecuted by the victim because the state's police refused to bring domestic violence charges. In 2017 police told the victim, Dani*, that there was a prima facie case against her former partner for threatening violence, but because there was a low level of public interest they would not bring a charge. Dani then took the rare step of hiring a barrister and prosecuting the criminal case herself. I will not be able to show my grandchildren what I saw. Mick Baron, a dive instructor from Tasmania, has watched entire sea forests disappear in his lifetime. Giant kelp forests used to flourish along the Tasman peninsula. But the area is a global heating hotspot and now, the forests are all gone. This is the cost of climate change, Baron says in today's episode of The Frontline, a major multimedia series from Guardian Australia about everyday Australians who are already living with the effects of the climate emergency. Police shot dead a man in the Brisbane CBD they allege ran at them armed with a knife. The ethical standards command in Queensland police are investigating after the man died on Mary Street. A 26-year-old man he allegedly stabbed in the morning was being treated at hospital for injuries to his face and back. Federal parliament is back sitting this week, but the controversial religious freedom bill is unlikely to be introduced. Instead the Senate inquiry into sports rorts has decided to call the head of the public service, Phil Gaetjens, and former sports minister Bridget McKenzie. Labor is broadening its attack on the grant programs, arguing the urban congestion fund was used to promote Coalition candidates. Retail electricity prices are tipped to fall by 7.1% by 2022 “ an average saving of $97 per household “ according to the Energy Security Board, as cost of renewables drops.

Bernie Sanders won the caucuses in Nevada, solidifying his frontrunner status in the race for the Democratic nomination. Sanders was bolstered significantly by Latino voters and has extended his lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Donald Trump's popularity rating is meanwhile improving, with a new Gallup poll giving Trump a 49% approval rating and a disapproval rating of 48%. Trump's security advisor has been slammed for politicising intelligence on Russian meddling. Robert O'Brien has said he has not seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to get the president re-elected, but also seemed to accept reports that Russia is backing Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. Reneging on Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland risks trade deals with the EU and the US, experts have warned.

Last year, a few months after her marriage ended, Rose Hartley froze her eggs. I was 34 with endometriosis and three separate doctors had told me that with an egg reserve as low as mine I'd be unlikely to conceive beyond my mid-30s. Considering I hadn't been able to get pregnant at 31 after trying for over a year with my ex-husband, I believed them. It was now or never. If Australia's resources were taxed the way Norway's are, we could secure the future of our schools, writes Emma Dawson. That the Australian people receive so little recompense for the extraction and export of our natural resources is indefensible. Australia is one of the most resource-rich nations on Earth: latest data from the Reserve Bank of Australia shows that mining makes up 10% of our economic output and 60% of our exports. Let's move beyond GDP, suggests Fiona Stanley in her 2020 vision. At the last OECD global forum on beyond GDP, more than 100 nations reported progress on developing indices to measure wellbeing, equity and sustainability as well as economic success. The underlying principle is that if these are national aspirations and can be measured well, policies that influence them can be developed, implemented and evaluated. Hence not only can we see the impact of these on GDP but also on total population measures. What happens when the oceans heat up? As we continue to see impacts from global heating around the world, research in the places first affected becomes increasingly more important. Off the coast of Tasmania the oceans are heating and it's one of a handful of places around the world that have seen an increase of 2C in a short time.

The confirmation they have contracted the virus brings the number of people with Covid-19 in the UK up to 13. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the patients caught the virus onboard the Diamond Princess. The cruise ship had been held for more than two weeks off the coast of Japan. The patients are being transferred from Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, Merseyside, to specialist NHS infection centres. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said a full infectious disease risk assessment was done before Saturday's flight back from Japan and stressed that no one who boarded the flight had displayed any symptoms of the virus. A total of 32 passengers “ 30 British and two Irish citizens “ were taken to the Arrowe Park hospital after their plane touched down in England. Janelle Holmes, chief executive at Wirral University Teaching Hospital, reassured staff that the hospital was running as usual. When guests arrived yesterday evening, we followed clear guidance in relation to infection prevention control. This was to minimise the chance of any infection spreading, she said. A number of other UK nationals who were onboard the Diamond Princess were evacuated to Australia. They included Northern Irish singer Rebecca Harkin who was part of the music entertainment team. Harkin, who is from Derry but lives across the border in County Donegal, said she and her partner were healthy and safe but would remain in Australia for the next two weeks. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. The news of four new coronavirus cases came as more than 100 Britons who had been flown back from China ended their two-week quarantine in Milton Keynes. The evacuees had been kept in isolation at Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre from 9 February. The British nationals and their family members were treated there after travelling on an evacuation flight from the Chinese city of Wuhan “ the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. One of the group allowed home on Sunday, Paul Walkinshaw, from Manchester, said he had been in China on holiday with his wife Lihong since the Chinese new year. As he left the centre, Walkinshaw said: Since we've been quarantined, we've been treated brilliantly. It was definitely hard at first (inside the quarantine) it is just one of those things. The 39-year-old praised the friendly staff and said he was looking forward to sleeping in his own bed again.

Starters Β£3.20-Β£12.80, roast duck portion Β£11.40, half Β£14.40, mains Β£9.30-Β£20.50, wines from Β£17.80, beers Β£4.50 It's after dinner that we really notice it. London's Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown's main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it's gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I've never seen it like this before. After the Chinese New Year at the end of January, as news of the emerging coronavirus spread, business just went down, says Jackie, duty manager of the Four Seasons at No 12, her hand making a swooping gesture like a plane crashing to ground. We want the business back but we can't do anything about it, she says, with a sad shrug. People are scared. Because a nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles away from London, Britain's Chinese community is suffering. Because, y'know, Chinese people. There are reports of abuse on the streets, of Asians being shunned on public transport. Across the Chinese restaurant sector, business is down. The mother of one Anglo-Chinese friend calls it health-linked racial discrimination. It doesn't matter what excuse you choose for your racism. It's still racism. So this is a review with a simple message: go and support your local Chinese restaurant. Go show them that ethnicity is not a marker for disease. I didn't need to go to the branch of the Four Seasons at 12 Gerrard Street to write about it. I eat there alone about once a month, taking a yellow-clothed table in the corner of one of the plain dining rooms. It's often before going to record an episode of the Kitchen Cabinet for Radio 4, when having a good lunch is a grand idea: a plate of Cantonese roast meats of one sort or another, something green, a magazine to read. The food speaks directly to an intense, needy part of my appetite. I also like the brisk and efficient staff who greet me like a total stranger every time, despite the fact I've been going for years. I've mentioned it on this page and elsewhere before. So no, I really didn't need to go again. I know what they do and how well they do it. But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck. I was introduced to this Four Seasons by chef and writer Simon Hopkinson. He once told me the Chinese are the best at roasting ducks and that this is one of the best places for the best. I say this one, because it's a group, which started over on London's Queensway. There are now half a dozen, including one in Leicester and one literally next door, which specialises in hot pots. But I have my loyalties. Sometimes I have the cubed belly pork. It has crackled skin like glass that shatters beneath the teeth, giving way to the soft layer of ivory-coloured fat underneath and then, below that, the meat. Tonight, though, we start with the char siu. It is not a worrying shade of traffic light red, as it sometimes can be, and nor is it dry, or too thinly sliced. It's just a deep, reddy brown, and in pleasing thumb-thick pieces and is eye-rollingly savoury. It comes on a heap of Chinese cabbage with the obligatory moat of dark, sweet-savoury liquor, which could be sipped neat as a restorative. Sometimes, when I am by myself and I'm convinced nobody is looking, I do just that, lifting the bowl to my lips as if it were a teacup. My motto: No spoonful left behind. And then the roast duck “ the skin dark lacquered, most of the fat rendered, the meat soft and sensuous to the tongue as if braised. Crispy duck with pancakes is the boisterous crowd-pleaser, and has its place. Deep orange Peking duck, with its caramel-crunchy skin slicing rituals and its two services, is the fancy Bond Street version. Peking duck can be exhausting, like some high maintenance pretty friend who constantly needs to be told how beautiful they are. This roast duck is the one I prefer: it doesn't need to be wrapped up in pancakes. It doesn't need hoisin or plum sauce or vegetables shredded within an inch of their life. It's self-contained and self-assured. Usually I get it bone in, because I like its tactile nature. Tonight, though, for ease of management with a sizable group, we have it boneless. Most of my party hasn't tried it this way before. I get to nod at them in a self-satisfied manner and mouth the words I know as they coo and mutter. Next the greens. For a long while it was the dry-fried green beans with minced pork and chilli. Then I discovered they did something similar with a big old tangle of morning glory. It comes in a thick pot, much like a classic mortar, which is so searingly hot they have to serve it inside a second container to spare the table. This means that when you're done with the vegetables, a ballast of minced pork and chilli has continued cooking and crusted around the bottom. It is illegal to not scrape this up. Beware: the metal spoon gets finger-burning hot from the bowl. We have big curls of salt and pepper squid in a fine, lacy batter and, because I'm feeling adventurous, lamb with ginger in a dark, sticky Peking sauce. We drink jasmine tea and a few Tsing Tao beers and run up a bill of Β£130 for four. There are wines, which I know from experience to be less than fabulous, but then why would you? We do not even investigate dessert. Just outside the door are waffle shops and Chinese patisseries. Until about 15 years ago, London's Chinatown was a sad place. You didn't go there to eat well. But the opening up of China has brought us the country's thrilling variety from Sichuan to Shanghai, from Hunan to Xinjiang and back again. It's happening all over. Walking from Birmingham New Street station recently, I was staggered to see that the once mainly Cantonese Chinatown has grown from a tiny cluster to a vast district apparently representing all the provinces. Britain's Chinese restaurant offering is more diverse and exciting than it's ever been. Please go and eat in one. Now. Time to name check a few other Chinese favourites. In Blackpool there's the Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar, both for pan-Asian dishes and Cantonese classics (and it's mothership deeper into town, Mandarin). In Manchester go to Live Seafood, for crustacea from the tanks cooked all ways. In Edinburgh visit Chop Chop for seriously compelling dumplings. And elsewhere in London's Chinatown, try Baiwei for bare bones Sichuan or JinLi just around the corner for similar food in plusher surroundings. Dumpling's Legend is the place for Xiao Long Bao (or soupy dumplings), and just across Shaftesbury Avenue there's the ever-brilliant Y Ming. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a premium immersive restaurant experience' based on the characters from the DC Comics universe, including Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman et al. What this means in terms of the actual food is anybody's guess, but it will occupy an 18,000 square foot basement site on London's Brewer Street. Jamie Oliver continues to rebuild his restaurant interests, despite the closure of so many UK outlets last year when the Jamie's Italian group failed, resulting in mass redundancies.

Well, there was the time when a man digging a trench outside the house for a new electric main put his digger through the water main and confessed that he hadn't been provided with the proper plans. Still, the impromptu fountain was quite diverting. However, that relationship was put under severe strain last week when I received the following from Scottish and Southern regarding some future improvements: The project, which will build resilience into the area's power supply through the undergrounding of section of cable and the refurbishment of the primary substation, will also allow for future commercial and residential connections. Look, I want utility companies to speak in plain English, not decide that perfectly good English words such as bury need to be sexed up. This sort of tripe is fit only for dodgy PR companies. Reading further on, the company says: Please note the works carried out will NOT interrupt your power supply. I'm not feeling too sanguine about that pledge. The Chinese authorities insist that the incidence of coronavirus is falling within China itself. Bet they've got some pretty impressive number crunchers. If only the incidence of the use of epicentre would show a similar retreat. But no. From the early days of its outbreak in Wuhan, experts of various hues have dished this out with carefree abandon. Could we get this straight: epicentre - the point on the Earth's surface directly above the focus of an earthquake? Centre will do more than adequately.

The Red Roses made it three wins from three with 14 points from a possible 15, staying on course to defend their Women's Six Nations title with a second straight grand slam against a battling Ireland outfit in front of a sell-out crowd of 5,000 at Castle Park. Ireland, who like England arrived unbeaten, were committed and physical, but the hosts' clinical approach meant the contest was over by half-time. Extremely strong winds called for keeping it simple, and that is what England did in a polished opening attack. Hooker Lark Davies burst through a tackle before winger Jess Breach was held up just short, as Ireland's scramble defence initially held firm. But England's set-piece power soon told, the hosts shoving a scrum over the line in the second minute. Captain and No 8 Sarah Hunter controlled the ball expertly at the base before flopping over for the opening score, which Emily Scarratt converted. Ireland responded impressively by retaining possession for several minutes, moving through numerous attacking phases and forcing England on to the back foot, before a lengthy stoppage saw Irish front-rower Lindsay Peat taken off injured, replaced by Laura Feely. The visitors' momentum was interrupted and England scored with their next possession. Amber Reed off-loaded beautifully to midfield colleague Scarratt, before the hosts worked the ball right for Abby Dow to dot down after a composed pass by full-back Sarah McKenna. Ireland again worked through some decent phases, but England's defensive work-rate repeatedly stopped them in their tracks. England then destroyed Ireland's scrum on the visitors' own put-in, and consequently built irresistible pressure in the left-hand corner, Breach diving over after a sharp pass by Scarratt on 26 minutes. Cliodhna Moloney's crunching hit on Sarah Bern displayed Ireland's determination, but they already trailed 17-0. Dow was nearly in again before half-time when Ireland full-back Eimear Considine failed to gather a searching kick. But England soon tightened their grip, sealing an attacking bonus point as Vicky Fleetwood finished off an unstoppable driving maul to make it 22-0. Ireland had 64% possession in the opening half, yet failed to trouble the scorers. The visitors began the second half revitalised and produced a big shove at an attacking scrum, but again failed to turn good field position into points. England's Dow was over the try line again on 57 minutes, but Scarratt's pass had gone forward. Yet after another dominant scrum, McKenna's strong finish stretched England's lead to 27-0. Scarratt could only laugh when her well-struck conversion attempt was blown wildly off course by another strong gust of wind. Both coaches emptied their benches and Ireland continued to defend spiritedly, while lacking the cutting edge required to breach England's well-drilled defence. England have battled the elements at every turn so far this year, but the sun is shining on their hopes of another grand-slam season. Elsewhere, France travelled to Cardiff Arms Park and kept the hosts scoreless with a 50-0 demolition of Wales, while Italy's scheduled meeting with Scotland was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.",general

Adding that it would be short-term and controllable, Xi said the government would step up efforts to cushion the blow. The country has taken a number of measures in recent weeks to prop up its economy. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Sunday that the global lender of last resort was ready to provide additional support, particularly to poorer countries by way of grants and debt relief. Speaking at a G20 meeting of finance leaders and central bank chiefs, she said the IMF assumed the impact would be relatively minor and shortlived, although she warned that the continued spread of the virus could have dire consequences. She added: Global cooperation is essential to the containment of the Covid-19 and its economic impact, particularly if the outbreak turns out to be more persistent and widespread. Efforts to prevent the spread of the disease were ramped up dramatically over the weekend by Italian authorities, raising the potential to harm eurozone growth at a time when the country's economy is already in contraction. More than 76,000 people in 27 countries have been infected by the new strain of coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the turn of the year. More than 2,200 people have died. International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, is scheduled to provide an update on its financial performance for 2019 on Friday that will be closely watched for updates about any potential future impact. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade body for the global airline industry, warned last week that falling passenger demand would cost the airline industry $29.3bn (Β£23.7bn) in lost revenues this year, with global air travel expected to fall for the first time in more than a decade. Luxury goods group HermΓ¨s will also provide an update to investors on Wednesday. Analysts have warned that transport groups, hospitality chains, airlines, luxury goods makers and retailers will be among those hardest hit by the coronavirus as Chinese consumers stay away from the shops and travellers put off holiday plans. There are also concerns for global supply chains as Chinese factories remain closed. Jaguar Land Rover warned last week it could run out of car parts at its British factories by next week. The car manufacturer admitted it had been bringing in parts from China to the UK in suitcases. Apple also sounded the alarm, warning of possible iPhone supply shortages because of the closure of its Chinese factories.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robinmckie,2/23/2020,theguardian,Passengers from coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess land in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/coronavirus-cruise-ship-diamond-princess-passengers-land-in-uk,"A repatriation flight carrying 32 Britons and Europeans from the coronavirus-infected cruise ship Diamond Princess landed in the UK on Saturday “ amid growing fears for the welfare of some UK passengers left behind in Japan. David and Sally Abel “ who were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary and who have been diagnosed with coronavirus “ have contracted pneumonia, it was revealed. Abel has acute pneumonia while his wife has a mild case of it. Dad is very weak, said their son, Steve. The Abels were among four Britons on the Diamond Princess who tested positive for coronavirus and were not included on the flight that touched down at the Ministry of Defence base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire shortly after 11.30am on Saturday. The 32 passengers, who have already spent more than two weeks trapped on the ship off the coast of Japan, were then taken to Arrowe Park hospital, Wirral, for 14 days of quarantine. They have so far tested negative for Covid-19. Arrowe Park had previously been used to quarantine 83 British nationals for 14 days earlier this month after they were flown out of Wuhan in China, which has been at the centre of the outbreak. In the meantime the Abels' children said their parents had been left in a hospital room in Japan that had no shower or bathing facilities, and had only been provided with basic paper towels. They don't know what's happening, they haven't had any treatments, said their son, Steve. They have been told that if they test negative twice they can go “ but that doesn't treat the pneumonia. The family, which has said it is willing to fly to Japan to bring the couple home, has criticised the Foreign Office response to their parents' plight, saying it has been next to useless. The NHS said it had started testing people for coronavirus in their own homes in London. This would be expanded to other areas in the coming weeks, said Professor Keith Willett, NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus. Home-testing will be carried out by NHS staff, allowing people to stay home rather than having to travel, which is safer for you and your family and limits the spread of infection, he said. Anyone who is concerned they have signs and symptoms should continue to use NHS 111 as their first point of contact.",general
Jeremy Bowman,2/23/2020,fool,3 Stocks That Could Double by This Summer,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/23/3-stocks-that-could-double-by-this-summer.aspx,"It's only February and theΒ S&P 500 has already set record highs multiple times this year. With the economy looking strong, an election making risky political moves unlikely, and new trade policies in place with China, Mexico, and Canada, 2020 is shaping up to be another bullish year. There have already been a number of big winners this year. Tesla sharesΒ have more than doubled this year on hopes for the company's disruptive potential in electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy, andΒ Virgin GalacticΒ shares have nearly tripled as bulls have pushed the only pure-play commercial space travel stock to new altitudes. These won't be the only big winners this year. Let's take a look at three other stocks that could double by this summer. It may be surprising to see the struggling home goods retailer on this list, but investors are already starting to get clued in to the company's turnaround potential. The stock rallied all the way from $7.31 per share in August to more than $17 in December, after Mark Tritton was named as the new CEO in October. Tritton comes to Bed Bath & BeyondΒ (NASDAQ:BBBY) after serving as Chief Merchandise Officer atΒ Target, where he helped guide that retailer to successful turnaround in part by launching a number of new owned brands at the big-box chain. When Tritton has dropped hints about his strategy for Bed Bath & Beyond, investors have reacted favorably. Earlier this week, he said the company would sell personalizationmall.com for $252 million to help fund improvements in its stores, supply, and digital initiatives, pushing the stock up 7%. It's also become clear that there's a lot of low-hanging fruit for Tritton to pick as he attempts to streamline the company. For instance, since taking the helm in November, he's cut the number of can openers the company sells from more than a dozen to three, and sales in the category rose. Doing so not only makes the customer experience better, but eliminates inventory and should help drive down costs and create economies of scale as the company can make bigger orders from the same suppliers.Β  The company earlier reported that comparable sales fell by an adjusted 13% in December and January, so its April earnings report will likely be a dud, but Tritton is preparing to roll out a comprehensive new strategy at an investor conference in May. If investors like what they hear and results improve, shares could make some serious gains. China stocksΒ have been rocked by the coronavirus outbreak, and it's still unknown how long the outbreak will persist and disrupt everyday business in China. However, some stocks have been surprising winners on the threat. YoudaoΒ (NYSE:DAO), a Chinese online education specialist, spiked in the initial days after the outbreak became serious. As an online education provider, the stock was in a unique position to benefit from the coronavirus, which forced schools to close.Β Β  Schools are still closed indefinitely in China,Β but 200 million children are taking classes online.Β  Such an event gives Youdao the opportunity to raise its profile and grow its business. The company offers a number of online courses for K-12 students and others, as well as educational apps and devices like translators. The recent IPO is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The stock is lightly covered with just one analyst forecasting revenue of $453.7 million, but a better-than-expected report and a bullish outlook for 2020 could lift the stock and propel further gains over the coming months. Other Chinese online education stocks likeΒ TAL EducationΒ andΒ New Oriental EducationΒ have already been big winners, and Youdao could easily follow in their footsteps. Another IPO debutante,Β Bill.com,(NYSE:BILL) has made a big splash since its December debut on the market. The stock jumped 60% on opening day and gained again in its first earnings report as a publicly traded company earlier in February. Bill.com is a provider of cloud-based software to handle back office operations, including payments for small and-medium-sized businesses. In its second-quarter earnings report, which came out in February, revenue jumped 50% to $39.1 million, smashing expectations at $33.8 million, and subscription revenue rose 61%, a promising sign for a SaaS model. In its outlook, Bill.com's forecast was also much better than analyst expectations, indicating Wall Street may have underestimated this stock's potential growth. What's also attractive about Bill.com is its strong position in payments, a business that has generated significant profits for peers likeΒ Paypal. It spends much less than many cloud stocksΒ on sales and marketing, which is also a bullish sign for future profitability as the company is able to grow rapidly without spending heavily on marketing. In the first half of the year it spent about 30% of its revenue on sales and marketing, but more went to research and development.Β  Bill.com won't report earnings again until May, but if tailwinds continue in cloud stocks and the company delivers another round of strong results, shares could move significantly higher.",business
Jon Evans,2/23/2020,techcrunch,What happens if a pandemic hits?,https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/what-happens-if-a-pandemic-hits/,"What happens if a COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic hits? What will the repercussions be if the virus spreads worldwide? How will it change how we live, work, socialize and travel? Don't get all disaster-movie here. Some people seem to have the notion that a pandemic will mean shutting down borders, building walls, canceling all air travel and quarantining entire nations indefinitely. That is entirely incorrect. Containment attempts can slow down an outbreak and buy time to prepare, but if a pandemic hits, by definition, containment has failed and further attempts will be pointless, if not counterproductive. Rather:   Absolutely must-read. Peter Sandman and Jody Lanard are super clear thinkers and writers. I wish I had written this paragraph. Having said that, this describes a rational response, not necessarily the response all govs will take https://t.co/V1EOawZZQo pic.twitter.com/zwWPD8l9Bj ” Marc Lipsitch (@mlipsitch) February 23, 2020  The focus will switch from containment to mitigation: slowing down how fast the virus spreads through a population in which it has taken root. Mitigation can occur via individual measures, such as frequent hand washing, and collective measures, such as social distancing ” cancellations of mass events, closures, adopting remote work and remote education wherever possible, and so forth. The slower the pandemic moves, the smoother the demands on health-care systems will be; the less risk those systems will have of becoming overloaded; the more they can learn about how best to treat the virus; and the greater the number of people who may ultimately benefit from a vaccine, if one is developed. I recommend the whole thread above this instructive graph:   The ultimate goal of such measures is to reduce the intensity of an outbreak, flattening out the epidemic curve and therefore reducing strain on the health system, and on social economic well-being (see this graphic representation). pic.twitter.com/fWOCq453Bx ” Josh Michaud (@joshmich) February 22, 2020  An important question for those of us in the media is: how do we report on COVID-19 in this time of great flux and uncertainty? I hereby direct you to this excellent Scientific American piece by Harvard's Bill Hanage and Marc Lipsitch: How to Report on the COVID-19 Outbreak Responsibly. (Disclosure: Bill is a personal friend.) We think reporting should distinguish between at least three levels of information: (A) what we know is true; (B) what we think is true”fact-based assessments that also depend on inference, extrapolation or educated interpretation of facts that reflect an individual's view of what is most likely to be going on; and (C) opinions and speculation [¦] facts about this epidemic that have lasted a few days are far more reliable than the latest facts that have just come out, which may be erroneous or unrepresentative and thus misleading. [¦] Distinguish between whether something ever happens and whether it is happening at a frequency that matters. Read the whole thing. As an opinion columnist, I'm on pretty safe ground, in that everything I write is definitionally (C) in the above taxonomy¦ but basically everything I'm citing counts as (B). Which includes the following statement: when I say if a in the first paragraph above, I really mean when the. A pandemic is coming. I recognize that may sound like irresponsible scaremongering. I strongly encourage you to be skeptical, to read widely, and to draw your own conclusions. But the clamor of expert voices is growing too loud to ignore. Here's an entire Twitter thread linking to epidemiologists at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and the Universities of Basel and Bern, saying so with very little ambiguity:   Round up of (assistant) profs of infectious disease spread saying we're likely past being able to contain coronavirus, i.e. headed for a pandemic and mitigation (NOT saying containment efforts are now pointless): @mlipsitch https://t.co/mP76jHPmGT1/2¦ ” Chris Wymant (@ChrisWymant) February 23, 2020  Don't panic. There is a great deal we can and will do to limit and mitigate this pandemic. It's all too easy to imagine fear becoming far more dangerous than the virus itself. Don't let that happen. It's also worth noting that its mortality rate is likely significantly lower than the headline 2%, not least because that doesn't include mild undiagnosed cases:   15. Think of an iceberg. With #COVID19, it's easy to see the deaths/serious cases. But people with mild illness don't go to hospital/don't get tested. Studies have to be done to find them. We need a clearer picture. If the data exist, share. If they don't, generate them. pic.twitter.com/26yau3wpCF ” Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) February 22, 2020  Furthermore, the rate seems much lower yet for anyone under 60 years old, and enormously lower for anyone under 50. Some more context regarding mitigation:   Let me pick up, where I left off yesterday: As #covid19 efforts shift from containment to mitigation, we have a window of opportunity to prepare the world. What does that mean? ” Kai Kupferschmidt (@kakape) February 23, 2020  Unless all of those people cited above are wrong, which seems highly unlikely, we will all spend the next weeks and months sharing the very strange collective experience of watching ” through our laptops and phones, through Twitter and mass media ” the spread of this pandemic through much of the world in what will seem like slow motion. Our day-to-day lives are ultimately likely to change somewhat. (If your office job isn't remote-work-friendly today, I assure you, it will be this time next year.) But it will be very far from the end of the world. I suspect we'll all be surprised by how soon it begins to feel almost normal.",tech
"Julia Horowitz, CNN Business",2/23/2020,cnn,Some of the world's biggest economies are on the brink of recession,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html," A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . Markets closed out last week on an anxious note. It's not difficult to see why: the coronavirus continues to spread, and there are signs that some of the world's top economies could slide into recession as the outbreak compounds pre-existing weaknesses. Take Japan: The world's third-largest economy shrank 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the country absorbed the effects of a sales tax hike and a powerful typhoon. It was biggest contraction compared to the previous quarter since 2014. Then there's Germany. The biggest economy in Europe ground to a halt right before the coronavirus outbreak set in, dragged down by the country's struggling factories. The closely-watched ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment in Germany decreased sharply for February, reflecting fears that the virus could hit world trade. Bank of America economist Ethan Harris points to the number of smaller economies that are hurting, too. Hong Kong is in recession and Singapore could soon suffer a similar fate. Fourth quarter GDP data from Indonesia hit a three-year low, while Malaysia had its worst reading in a decade, he noted to clients on Friday. Read More Meanwhile, engines of growth like China and India slowed in 2019. Fourth quarter GDP data for the latter comes out this week. All of this brings to the fore concerns about the global economy's ability to withstand a shock from the coronavirus. Harris says the weak quarter was likely a result of lingering damage from the trade war between China and the United States. The coronavirus is poised to make matters worse. ""Global equities have rebounded as the US and China have converged to a ceasefire, but companies with global supply chains remain deeply uncertain,"" he said. On the radar: Even the United States may not be in as strong a position as previously thought. IHS Markit said Friday that US services sector contracted in February, with the reading hitting a 76-month low. It's the first time the sector has contracted in four years. President Trump heads to India as trade tensions simmer President Donald Trump is scheduled to arrive in India on Monday for a state visit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the background: A brewing trade fight between the United States and one of the world's most crucial emerging economies. Last year, the Trump administration ended special trade treatment for India, removing a status that exempted billions of dollars of the company's products from US tariffs. India increased tariffs on US exports in response. The United States has since been occupied with other trade conflicts ” namely nailing down a truce with China. But following a ""phase one"" deal with Beijing, the spat with India may get renewed attention. That could mean an agreement to take a step back, or a breakdown in communication and more escalation. Managing expectations: Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, told reporters on Friday not to expect a big trade component to the visit. ""I think you might see his public willingness to negotiate with India,"" he said. ""He and Modi, they're friends."" But Trump has regularly called Chinese President Xi Jinping a friend, too.

"Livia Borghese and Tara John, CNN",2/23/2020,cnn,Italy coronavirus cases soar as authorities scramble to find patient zero,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/europe/italy-novel-coronavirus-spike-intl/index.html," Italian authorities have announced sweeping closures in the country's north as they scramble to contain Europe's biggest outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Italy's confirmed cases surged from three on Friday morning to more than 200 by Monday. The majority of coronavirus infections are concentrated in mainland China (with more than 77,100 cases), followed by Japan (840) and South Korea (833). Italy's spike now marks the biggest outbreak outside of Asia. Five people have died and at least 219 others have been infected with the virus in Italy, Angelo Borrelli, head of the country's Civil Protection agency, said at a Monday news conference. The bulk of the cases (167) are in the northern region of Lombardy, whose capital is the city of Milan. Read More Borrelli added that one person had recovered and that 91 people with the virus were currently in isolation at home. From one-time Chinese capital to coronavirus epicenter, Wuhan has a long history that the West had forgotten Officials have yet to track down the first carrier of the virus in the country. ""We still cannot identify patient zero, so it's difficult to forecast possible new cases,"" Borrelli said at an earlier press conference. Strict emergency measures were put in place over the weekend, including a ban on public events in at least 10 municipalities, after a spike in confirmed cases in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Italy's Health Minister Roberto Speranza announced severe restrictions in the affected regions, which included the closure of public buildings, limited transport, and the surveillance and quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. ""We are asking basically that everyone who has come from areas stricken by the epidemic to remain under a mandatory house stay,"" Speranza said at a Saturday press conference. Nearby countries within the borderless Schengen Area that covers most of western Europe have gotten jittery over the spike in Italy's numbers. A train from Italy was stopped at the Austrian border on Sunday evening when two German women on board reported fever symptoms, public broadcaster ORF said. The train was let through after the women tested negative for the virus. Austrian authorities said they would meet on Monday to study the situation and analyze if border controls with Italy were necessary. Sports and fashion affected Italy's top soccer league, Serie A, canceled at least four matches scheduled to be played in Lombardy and Veneto regions. Atalanta versus Sassuolo, Hellas Verona versus Cagliari, Torino versus Parma, and Inter Milan versus Sampdoria were suspended, according to Serie A's website on Sunday. The country's fashion capital, Milan, announced it would close its schools starting Monday for a week. School trips inside and outside Italy were also being canceled from Sunday, according to a statement by Italy's Ministry of Education. Healthy Wuhan residents say they were forced into mass coronavirus quarantine, risking infection The spike in numbers has also affected the end of Milan Fashion Week. Fashion houses Giorgio Armani and Laura Biagiotti confirmed to CNN that they will be holding Sunday's fashion shows with no spectators and behind closed doors. Venice Carnival is being suspended in the face of the outbreak, Luca Zaia, the governor of the Veneto region, announced Sunday. Two of the region's 25 cases occurred in Venice, the popular tourist destination whose carnival celebrations attract visitors from across the world. Zaia also announced a ban on public and private meetings, and closures of schools, universities and museums in the region. ""We ask for the cooperation of all citizens. It's not an easy moment. But, with the data we have today, we can still hope to limit the contagion,"" Zaia said. As worries grow in Italy's north, authorities in the country's south put a migrant rescue ship in quarantine in Sicily, the interior ministry said Sunday. The Ocean Viking, which has 274 migrants aboard who were rescued at sea, is quarantined in Pozzallo, Sicily, along with the ship's crew. 'Window of opportunity is narrowing' The situation has raised fears about the spike in cases outside mainland China among people with no connection to China or the city of Wuhan -- ground zero for the outbreak. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated on Saturday that there was still a chance to contain the virus beyond China, ""but the window of opportunity is narrowing."" ""Although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case,"" he said. The increase in cases in Iran, South Korea and Italy ""is also a matter of concern and how the virus is now spreading to other parts of the world,"" Tedros added.

Four Serie A matches, including Inter Milan's home game against Sampdoria, were postponed over the weekend. Italy is trying to contain the coronavirus outbreak in their country and have imposed strict quarantine restrictions in two northern hotspots which has left 50,000 people stranded. Naples is not one of the affected areas but the Italian health ministry has said is mandatory for all travelers to undergo testing. It means Lionel Messi and his team-mates will have their temperature checked upon arrival at the airport on Monday.If any are deemed to be too high, they will be taken straight to hospital. Barcelona take on Napoli on Tuesday and they will fly back to Catalonia as soon as the match is over.   Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte spoke at a news conference where he confirmed some football fixtures were to be cancelled as a matter of precaution. ""Minister of Sport [Vincenzo] Spadafora intends to suspend all sporting events planned for Sunday in the Veneto and Lombardy regions,"" Conte said. Meanwhile, Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong is looking forward to testing himself in such an iconic stadium. I have never played at Stadio San Paolo, but Napoli are a very good team, he said.  We played against them in preseason but that is always different and it doesn't mean very much. Napoli have lots of quality, although this season they have had somewhat disappointing results in Serie A. They have done well in the Champions League, for example against Liverpool. Napoli are a very strong team and we hope that these will be great matches for us! In the group stage, you have six matches. So if you lose one or have a bad day, you can still fix it. It is much more difficult in the knockout stages. You also are left with only the best teams; there is not much difference in the level between them.""   The young Dutchman also hailed team-mate Messi who smashed four against Eibar in La Liga on Saturday. When I began training with him it was strange, because when I was 12, still in secondary school, I used to watch a lot of football, he added. He was already the best in the world.

"Nectar Gan, Lily Lee and David Culver, CNN",2/23/2020,cnn,"Healthy Wuhan residents say they were forced into mass quarantine, risking infection forced into quarantine in Wuhan",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/22/asia/china-coronavirus-roundup-intl-hnk/index.html," Three weeks ago, Lisa Wang was fighting a high fever when she was turned away from an overflowing hospital in Wuhan, the central Chinese city mired in a deadly coronavirus crisis . A chest scan showed her lungs were infected, but she couldn't get treated for the novel coronavirus she likely had because there weren't enough beds at the Wuhan Third Hospital, a doctor told her. Instead, she was given medication and instructed to self-quarantine at home. But on Tuesday, despite having recovered from the illness and been given the all-clear, the 30-year-old lawyer said she was forced into a makeshift quarantine center at a technology park -- putting her at risk of cross-infection with hundreds of other patients warehoused in the bare-bones facility. They couldn't provide me with a hospital when I was sick. Now when I'm recovered, they forced me into one Lisa Wang, a recovered patient ""They couldn't provide me with a hospital when I was sick. Now when I'm recovered, they forced me into one,"" Wang, who asked to use a pseudonym for fear of repercussions, told CNN over the phone. Read More ""I'm very angry, because I feel I shouldn't have come here,"" she said. Wang's involuntary relocation to the center was part of escalating government efforts to contain the spread of the virus, which has claimed more than 2,200 lives and infected more than 76,000 people worldwide. Under the measures, individuals deemed to be high risk -- either those with signs of the virus, or those who have come into close contact with confirmed cases -- are removed from the population and placed into hundreds of temporary isolation centers set up across the city. Wang is among thousands caught in the web of restrictive measures now in place in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak since the virus emerged in mid-December. Patients at night in a ""Fangcang hospital"" -- a makeshift quarantine shelter converted from the Hongshan Gymnasium in Wuhan. 'Round up' The city of 11 million has been on lockdown since January 23, but the virus had already spread to the rest of the country. Most of the deaths, however, have been in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, as have the majority of confirmed cases. Leaders in Beijing removed the Communist Party bosses of Hubei and Wuhan earlier this month amid seething public anger over the government's alleged mishandling of the outbreak. They were replaced by two hardliners, parachuted in from outside the province, both with extensive backgrounds in law enforcement. Almost immediately after Wang Zhonglin's arrival in Wuhan to replace the city's party chief, quarantine measures were escalated. Wang, who rose through the ranks as a police officer, ordered a city-wide, three-day roundup of people possibly sickened with the coronavirus. That was a response to the central leadership's decree last week to ""round up everyone who should be rounded up"" -- an attempt to prevent further cross-infection in families and communities. Since Monday, many people have been barred from leaving their residential compounds, even to buy groceries. Supermarkets have shut their doors to individuals, only accepting ""group orders"" from communities, according to residents interviewed by CNN and state media reports . A community worker stands in front of a residential building as he prepares to conduct a health check in Caidian District of Wuhan. Wang warned sternly that district party bosses and governors would be held responsible if any confirmed or suspected cases were found at home after the dragnet ended on Wednesday, the state-run Changjiang Daily reported Tuesday. The stringent searches are designed to corral all infected patients under self-quarantine into medical facilities for treatment. The move followed an online outcry over infected people who couldn't get admitted into hospitals and were dying at home or infecting other family members. Confirmed patients with mild symptoms were put in the so-called Fangcang hospitals, stadiums and exhibition halls converted into makeshift hospitals where doctors and nurses perform basic medical care. As of Tuesday, more than 8,500 patients have been admitted into 12 Fangcang Hospitals across the city, according to state-run news agency Xinhua . Suspected cases, close contacts of confirmed cases and patients with fevers were put in temporary quarantine centers set up in requisitioned hotels and university dormitories. As of Wednesday, police in Wuhan have helped transfer more than 22,000 people from their homes to hospitals and quarantine centers, according to China's Ministry of Public Security. However, some recovered patients -- like Wang -- have been caught up in the mass roundup and exposed to unnecessary risks of cross-infection. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Volunteers visit a community in Jiang'an District of Wuhan to search for confirmed or suspected patients at home. ""I have no choice...I have to comply"" Wang, the young lawyer who was forced into mass quarantine, and her husband are a typical middle-class family in Wuhan, an economic engine along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Their lives, like millions of others in the city, have been turned upside down by the outbreak, since her husband developed a fever on January 22. She said she spent three days taking care of him at home before he was admitted to hospital. By then, she had already developed a fever. Wang started her own self-quarantine on January 28, the same day she said she got turned away by the Wuhan Third Hospital. Within a week, her fever had subsided and her temperature had returned to normal. Her neighborhood committee arranged two nucleic acid tests for her, and both came back negative for the coronavirus. Despite the results, she said the committee insisted that she move into a ""quarantine hotel"" -- one of the more than 500 temporary quarantine centers set up by the government in hotels and university dormitories across the city. Wang obliged. A relic from the Mao era, neighborhood committees typically serve as an intermediary between residents and the government, maintaining grassroots stability and order. Since the outbreak, however, they have been thrust to the front line in the fight against the virus, tasked with screening residents for suspected patients, allocating community resources and coordinating with hospitals. At the quarantine hotel, Wang did another chest scan on February 16. It showed the infection in her lungs was gone and a doctor she knew told her she had recovered. Wang said she was relieved. On Tuesday, however, things took a dark turn. Wang was told by her neighborhood committee that she could not go home. Instead, she had to go to a ""Fangcan hospitals"" because she couldn't provide a hospital ""discharge letter.""  Wang protested that she had no way of obtaining one because she was never admitted into a hospital. ""They said if I refused to go, the police would come and forcibly take me there,"" Wang said. Later that evening, Wang was bused to the Optics Valley Convention and Exhibition Center along with more than 40 people from her hotel. The center was featured on state broadcaster CCTV when it opened last week, footage of its shiny new wards and spotless floors beamed across the country. Lisa Wang was sent to a ""Fangcang hospital"" converted from an exhibition center at a technology park in Wuhan. ""We want to create a warm environment in the hospital and provide sound medical services. We hope all patients will recover soon,"" Wu Yingchun, an official in charge of the exhibition center, told CCTV . Conditions on the ground, however, appeared different. Bags of garbage, including unfinished meals and used masks, were piling up on the floor, and no medicine or treatment were provided to patients apart from daily temperature checks, according to Wang. ""Here, two doctors are in charge of 200 patients,"" she said. There was no central heating inside. Instead, heated blankets were provided to patients to keep them warm. Rows of portable toilets and shower rooms were located outdoors, in the biting cold. ""The condition here is tough,"" Wang said, adding that she did not dare to use the showers, fearing cross-infection. Wang was concerned that other viral diseases -- such as the common flu -- could easily spread in the large converted space, crowded with rows of beds without any partitions.

Nemo Kim  in Daegu,2/23/2020,theguardian,'It's ruining everyone': eerie quiet reigns in coronavirus-hit South Korean city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/its-ruining-everyone-coronavirus-hit-south-korean-city-daegu,"Sunday morning found Kim Tae-woo sitting in his convenience store at the normally bustling East Daegu train station, counting the day's customers on the fingers of one hand. Things are beyond quiet here, he said. It feels like I'm at a meditation centre. I'm thinking of removing the magazine stand. No one has the peace of mind to flip through them now. South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on red alert on Sunday as its number of coronavirus infections tripled over the weekend to 602. Barring the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, South Korea now has the highest number of infections outside China. Residents of Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city and the centre of its outbreak, are leaving nothing to chance. The city's streets were eerily quiet, with stores and restaurants closed and stations, markets and shopping areas devoid of the usual foot traffic. The few people who dared to venture out were masked and wearing gloves. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case “ about as serious as a regular cold “ and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. More than half of all South Korean cases so far have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus sect, with over 100 more cases coming from a mental health ward at Daenam hopital in the nearby town of Cheongdo. Officials believe cases at the hospital may be related to a funeral of the sect leader's brother, held there at the beginning of February. While the exact source of the infections remains unclear, health officials have pointed to a 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive on 18 February. Local authorities are now scrambling to trace all 9,336 members of the church's Daegu branch as well as out of town visitors who may have come into contact with the woman. A taxi driver, Kwang-ho Lee, wondered why the woman hadn't done more to stop spreading the disease. It's ruining everyone here, he said. I'm making less than 10% of my normal income. The other drivers and I are just standing around, waiting all day. Sometimes we're even too scared to talk to each other because we don't know who has the virus and who might belong to that cult. There is widespread anger over the sect's secretiveness and their apparent unwillingness to cooperate with health officials. According to the authorities, more than 600 members of the Daegu branch are not answering calls or texts and cannot be accounted for. A petition demanding that the government forcibly disband the Shincheonji Church of Jesus was posted on the presidential office's website on Friday, and has so far attracted more than 300,000 signatures. The public fury directed at both the sect and the authorities was echoed by a bus driver, whose vehicle carried a single passenger. If I violate a traffic law, police contact me before the day is over and I get fined, he said. How come they can't get hold of so many cult members? How can we say South Korea is an IT powerhouse with this going on? At Dongseung-ro, a popular meeting place for the city's youth, things were quiet and most of the stores and cafes were closed. Sung-jin Choi and Yoon Na, a couple in their twenties, had decided to go out, masked up and with gloves on. We saw on the internet that now is the time to experience this area looking like Gotham City, so we decided to have a look, said Choi. Na said that some couples were choosing not to meet up because no one is sure whether their partner belonged to the cult. Only couples who know each other very well can be sure, he added. One of the few places in Daegu where more than 20 people had congregated on Sunday was at the city's medical centre. The hospital has become a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre, with paramedics and nurses working in full biohazard suits and plastic face visors. Some 30 people were waiting to be examined in a makeshift tent set up outside the main hospital building. Despite the constant activity by staffers, things were curiously quiet, the silence broken only by the comings and goings of ambulances and the odd cough. On the other side of the city, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus building was locked up and the area, as with other parts of Daegu, was deserted. Simon Kim, a spokesman for the church, said it was cooperating fully with authorities. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. We're the biggest victims of the Covid-19 epidemic, he said, [and we have] become a target of hatred. He said a membership list the church had given the authorities had been leaked, provoking hate speech and members being pressured to leave their jobs. Back at the train station, a group of five people sat around the communal TV set in the ticket hall. All turned out to be workers rather than travellers; given the lack of customers, there was little need for them to be behind their counters. When one of them coughed, the others turned away from the screen to look at her. It's not corona, she said, with a wave of her hand. My tea went down the wrong way. No one looked relieved.",general
Oli Smith,2/23/2020,express,Coronavirus latest: Military lockdown imposed on dozens of Italian towns - outbreak fears,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1246178/Coronavirus-panic-Italy-outbreak-military-lockdown-quarantine-South-Korea-China-latest," Large parts of Italy have been placed under emergency quarantine following a dramatic spike in the number of coronavirus cases in the European country. The number of infected surged past 100 on Sunday, following the two deaths from the virus. The fear of an uncontrollable coronavirus outbreak has since prompted the government to swiftly approve an emergency decree late on Saturday. The decree enables ""extraordinary measures""  to tackle the spread of the biggest European outbreak of the coronavirus including placing entire towns under lockdown. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the emergency plan which allows adopted special powers to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. The measures also mandate that police and armed forces ""have the authority to ensure the regulations are enforced"". Following the mass panic in Italy, authorities have suspended all school and sports activities in those areas, including several Serie A football matches due to take place today.   JUST IN: Inter Milan vs Sampdoria postponed as Serie A take action   The Italy versus Scotland women's Six Nations game set for tonight has also been postponed over coronavirus fears. Italy's industrial heartlands Lombardy and Vento, which jointly account for 30 percent of gross domestic output, are the worst hit areas in Italy. Around a dozen towns in these regions have been placed on lockdown, meaning that around 50,000 people are effectively quarantined under the government plan. One Lombardy resident told France24: I think wearing a masks the right thing to do but there is too much panic. Shutting down the streets is going too far.""  However, several health official fears that the emergency measures are too late and that the infection has spread beyond Lombardy and Veneto. Lombardy's health chief Giulio Gallera said: ""The contagiousness of this virus is very strong and pretty virulent."" South Korea, which is the worst hit country outside of China, raised its coronavirus alert to the ""highest level"" earlier today.

The coronavirus originated in the Chinese province of Hubei last year, but has since spread to 26 countries, where more than 1,400 cases and 11 deaths have been confirmed. However, inside China, health authorities have reported a decrease in the rate of deaths and new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday.

Paul French,2/23/2020,cnn,"A history of Wuhan, one-time Chinese capital and coronavirus epicenter",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/22/asia/wuhan-history-hnk-intl/index.html," Before the novel coronavirus outbreak hit Wuhan in December, the exact whereabouts -- and even existence -- of the central Chinese city had slipped from the general public's awareness in the West. But it wasn't always that way. Two generations ago, this city of 11 million people, on the junction of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, 600 miles upstream, in central China, was known through the West as a major industrial city. It was somewhere many European powers had a consulate, a place where major Western and Japanese trading firms, and international textile and engineering companies, had factories and sales offices. It was a regular overseas posting for customs officers, steamboat captains, traders and consuls. Wuhan was also a cradle of China's revolution in 1911. A quarter of a century later, it stood defiantly as the beleaguered wartime capital of nationalist China. Read More From the middle of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century, Wuhan was a city that regularly appeared in the international press and, as a trading hub for teas and silks among other commodities, it directly impacted the lives of people in the West -- it made the tea in their teapots, the powdered egg in their birthday cakes, the silk for their pajamas. After the chaos and destruction of the Second World War, the Communist Revolution brought the Bamboo Curtain firmly down. International trade stopped, the foreign business community left, and the Western world largely forgot about Wuhan. The Chicago of China In 1900, American magazine Collier's published an article about the Yangtze ""boom town"" of Wuhan, calling it ""the Chicago of China."" It was one of the first times -- if not the first -- the Chinese city had been given this moniker, and it stuck. In 1927, the veteran United Press Shanghai correspondent Randall Gould used the moniker in a dispatch about political turmoil in Hubei province. After this, the term appears hundreds of times in just about every paper around world. Minnesota-born Gould was fairly fresh off the boat in Shanghai when he journeyed up the Yangtze to Wuhan for the first time. Gould was in town because a revolution was going on -- the second in Wuhan in 15 years. The Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, had split over the bloody suppression tactics used in its brutal war against the nascent Communist Party. A steamer is loaded in Hankow. Left-wing sympathizers established the breakaway Wuhan Nationalist Government, while Chiang formed his own majority government in Nanjing. The alternative government in Wuhan only lasted six months, but it revealed the long-running divisions within the Chinese Nationalist Party. To foreign correspondents like Gould, it looked like the young Chinese republic was about to wrench itself apart. Their editors in London, New York, Paris and Tokyo agreed. Wuhan was front page news. That editorial decision was partly influenced by the long list of companies with substantial stakes in Wuhan in 1927 -- the Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank (HSBC), John Swire & Sons, British-American Tobacco, Standard Oil of New York, Texaco, Standard Chartered Bank. Wuhan was China's major industrial powerhouse, producing iron and steel, silk and cotton, tea packing and food canning. It was the Chicago of China. An image believed to date back to 1906-1907 of Hankou, one of three cities that merged to become Wuhan. The West's introduction to Wuhan The West came to know Wuhan in 1858 as part of the unequal Treaty of Tianjin, extracted from the weakened Qing Dynasty during the Second Opium War. The treaty allowed foreign ships to sail up the Yangtze River, and the British had surveyed the waterway as far as Hubei province. They particularly examined the riverside conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang, collectively known as the ""Three Towns of Wuhan."" Liking what they saw, they demanded the city be opened to foreign trade. Robert Bickers, a professor at Bristol University, who studies the foreign presence in pre-1949 China, explains the British thinking: ""After the First Opium War the British annexed Hong Kong as a colony and opened Shanghai, on the coast at the head of the Yangtze in eastern China, as a treaty port. Sixteen years later they understood the importance of inland China better and so zeroed in on Wuhan, as well as Tianjin."" Wuhan became essential to the coastal port cities, feeding them commodities (tea, meat, tobacco etc) and produced outputs (iron, steel, silk etc). Wuhan was China's largest inland entrepΓ΄t. A group of laborers in front of the first blast furnace of the new steel-producing center being built in Wuhan, China, in 1959. Wuhan was already a massive in city in 1850 -- approximately 1 million people lived in the three towns half the size of the world's largest city at the time, London. From the 1860s, foreigners flooded in, though the city always had a Chinese majority population. The new arrivals clustered in Hankou creating a tree-lined, two-mile long Bund, which largely remains today, building their warehouses, docks and offices as well as a race track, clubs and public gardens all adjacent to the Hankou waterfront. The British Concession was adjacent to concessions run by the Germans, the French, the Japanese, a rather disputed Belgian concession, and the Russians, who had been active in Wuhan trading tea from Siberia since the 12th century. All these nations, including the Americans, had consulates. Holt House was the office for Butterfield & Swire, one of the biggest and best-known British ""hongs"" or trading houses in China. While Wuhan became a cosmopolitan place, it was always essentially a business town -- it never developed the nightlife or the movie industry, publishing houses, and art galleries that clustered in Shanghai's more Bohemian quarters; it wasn't quite the scholarly center that was Beijing. The foreigners were present, and their soldiers guarded the consulates, but the city retained a more dominant Chinese feel. Center of revolt In 1911, the republican revolution that overthrew China's last imperial dynasty was, albeit accidentally, sparked in Wuhan. The initial catalyst for the revolt was the accidental explosion of a bomb that occurred when a careless anti-Qing/pro-republican revolutionary dropped a lit cigarette in the workshop of some rebel conspirators in Hankou's Russian Concession. The ensuing explosion alarmed a nervous German butcher who called the police, who in turn uncovered a revolutionary plot. Seals, plans and documents were seized implicating members of the city's Wuchang Garrison of Chinese soldiers as revolutionaries preparing to mutiny. As police had seized their membership list, the rebels were faced with a choice between arrest, torture and probable beheading or putting up a fight. They decided to act immediately to preserve themselves. The anti-Qing rebellion took hold and eventually ended the 267-year-old Qing Dynasty. In general, foreign business welcomed the new republic and saw it as a harbinger of greater support for modern industries. A view of the 1,678-meter long  Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan, China. Indeed, Wuhan was awash with new industrial ideas and technologies. The city was home to several major Chinese heavy industries -- the Hubei Arsenal and Powder works, Hanyang Iron and Steel, a railway line to Beijing, regular steamer services to Shanghai, a mass of silk filatures, cotton mills and canneries. The city's furnaces made a high percentage of the world's horseshoes -- a product as important in the late 19th century as tires today. Its stock yards boiled down pig carcasses by the hundreds of thousands to extract millions of pig bristles for export to Europe and America -- the major, and essential, component in the booming toothbrush market. Wuhan was also a center of egg production -- fresh eggs, preserved, powdered, liquid -- and exported them to food manufacturers, restaurants and bakeries around the world. As Wuhan became more industrially significant globally, its role as an export powerhouse gave the city national power. Robert Bickers notes that the city ""unobtrusively entered consumers' lives in Europe and America."" But some foreign buyers didn't believe that China could produce iron, steel, and food to Western standards. Yet China was manufacturing steel and iron for its new railways, bridges and urban construction while also ramping up its armaments industry to create a newly-organized modern army under Chiang Kai-shek's command. Ways around these foreign prejudices had to be found. Comparatively low pricing was one way to convince cost-conscious buyers, others were a little more creative. Sampans by the Hankou Bund during the 1931 floods, in Wuhan. Carl Crow, an American advertising executive who lived in China between 1911 and 1937, visited Wuhan regularly and saw how the Chinese manufacturers got around this problem. Crow recalled in his classic 1937 guide to doing business in China, ""Four Hundred Million Customers,"" that the iron and steel mills often stamped their products ""Made in Hamburg,"" while sewing needles read ""Made in the USA."" In the US, meanwhile, foreign eggs were considered low-quality so they shipped them in boxes marked ""England,"" where produce was considered good. Nobody noticed a thing. A target Wuhan officials insisted that international trade deals be done in Wuhan and not, as was often the case in other treaty ports, negotiated in the palatial offices and swish private clubs of Shanghai. Therefore a larger portion of the money from this business stayed in the city and didn't flow out to Shanghai or Guangzhou. It reinvested at least some of that money. The Europeans and Americans may have landscaped their concessions in Hankou, but Chinese Wuhan was also considered beautiful. The sprawling garden campus of Wuhan University covers the city's Luojia Hil. This institution is where Virginia Woolf's nephew, Julian Bell, taught English in the mid-1930s. He thought it idyllic. But by the late 1930s, Wuhan's strengths made it a target. The Japanese had long invested in the city, operating cotton mills, cotton-seed oil factories, and bean processing plants, and keenly regarded it. Japan invaded eastern China in the summer of 1937. They bombed Shanghai and horrifically raped the Nationalist capital of Nanjing. The government was forced to retreat further up the Yangtze to Wuhan. Chiang Kai-shek's temporary capital there once again featured on the front pages of the world's newspapers. An industrial scene in Hankow. Ultimately doomed, Wuhan fell to the Japanese in October 1938. Much of the city's industry was physically dismantled and transported further up the Yangtze to the final Nationalist capital of Chongqing, where it was to form the backbone of China's wartime heavy industry. After the war, even with severely reduced exports, Wuhan resumed its position as China's largest industrial center and inland port along the Yangtze. In the 1950s, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge connected three major rail lines making Wuhan once again the country's major central rail terminus. But by then foreign business was gone; the old Bund and concessions had been shuttered or repurposed. Wuhan slipped from our collective memories. But life went on, industry went on and, in the 1980s, foreign business began to return. Wuhan emerged as a center of auto production -- Honda, Citroen and GM are among major investors in the city, while pharmaceuticals and new environmental technologies flourished in the city. But Wuhan rarely made it to the front pages again, until now.",general
Phaedra Henley,2/23/2020,theconversation,Rwanda is training health workers for an interconnected world,https://www.theconversation.com/rwanda-is-training-health-workers-for-an-interconnected-world-131788,"Growing scientific evidence shows that environmental transformations such as climate change and pollution are linked to people's health. The number of extreme events is increasing, often driven by human activities, and they often pose an immediate threat as well as having long-term health impacts. This is a future for which health professionals must be prepared.  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is just the most recent example of the links between the environment, animals and the activities and health of people. The virus is suspected to have originated from a bat and been transmitted through an animal market in Wuhan, China. The 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pandemic was another global outbreak that was attributed to human interaction with wildlife. The interdependency between humans, animals and the environment is becoming more pronounced. It's time to approach health problems in a broad, interdisciplinary way. The attitudes and practices of the health workforce will have to change.   There is already a conceptual framework in place for this. It just needs to be adopted more widely and urgently, supported by policy and education.  The One Health approach recognises the links between humans and their biophysical, social and economic environments. It sees these links reflected in the population's state of health. One Health differs from other approaches to health as it considers the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally to achieve optimal health for animals, the environment and humans. Many international institutions, such as the World Health Organisation and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, have adopted One Health in principle. And it's being integrated into academic programming, including medical and veterinary schools, to some extent. The One Health approach emphasises the development of students who analyse, interpret and create plans for both the present and future worlds. It takes disciplinary strengths and their best practices and compels them to work together.
It challenges existing barriers and provides a platform to consider innovative solutions. One Health embraces complexity and looks at the whole picture to identify changes that will have a health impact. It also looks for points where intervention creates change.  Rwanda is one country, among others in East Africa such as Kenya and Uganda, that is embedding One Health into its way of doing things. The country adopted the One Health approach in 2011. This was prompted by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and their potential impact on socio-economic growth.  One Health in Rwanda provides a formal, institutionalised, multi-sectoral and  coordinated approach to detecting and responding to outbreaks and other health threats. Rwanda has the second highest population density in sub-Saharan Africa and borders countries where disease outbreaks such as Ebola and Marburg have occurred. This puts it at risk of health challenges at the human-animal-environment interface. It also has a strong network of community health workers, rapid response teams, and academic partnerships who champion the One Health approach. Education of professionals is part of the plan. At the University of Global Health Equity, located in rural Rwanda, medical and Global Health graduate students are introduced to One Health through field-based learning. Site visits include a local pig farm, wetlands surrounding the campus, homesteads in the community and a model village where displaced people have been resettled. These visits allow students to see the links between animals, the environment and the health of humans.  For example, at the pig farm, students observe the direct interactions between the farmers, the pigs and the environmental setting the farm is located in. They learn about protective measures used to prevent zoonotic disease transmission from the pigs to humans and vice versa. They are able to ask the farm's veterinarian questions about how they interact with health professionals around emerging diseases.  At the end of the programme, students will have acquired a diverse skill set and the management and communication training needed to respond to complex health challenges. For example, a medical doctor who participated in the site visits would ask patients more questions to determine patient history, such as whether they interact with animals. This more holistic approach to health may provide the clue to determine the cause of the patient's condition. Results of these efforts in Kenya suggest that training the next generation of professionals to use the lens of One Health will help solve complex health challenges like global disease outbreaks.",business

The coronavirus outbreak is posing a devastating impact on people's life and the economy in China, but there's a silver lining that the epidemic might have benefited a few players in the technology industry as the population remains indoors. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus that infected thousands and killed hundreds in China back in 2002 is widely seen as a catalyst for the country's fledgling e-commerce industry. People staying indoors to avoid contracting the deadly virus flocked to shop online. Alibaba's Taobao,  an eBay-like digital marketplace, notably launched at the height of the SARS outbreak. Although it sickened thousands and killed almost eight hundred people, the outbreak had a curiously beneficial impact on the Chinese internet sector, including Alibaba, wrote China internet expert Duncan Clark in his biography of Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Nearly two decades later, as the coronavirus outbreak sends dozens of Chinese cities into various kinds of lockdown, tech giants are again responding to fill consumers' needs. Others are providing digital tools to help citizens and the government battle the disease. According to data from analytics company QuestMobile, Chinese people's average time spent on the mobile internet climbed from 6.1 hours a day in January, to 6.8 hours a day during Chinese New Year, to an astounding daily usage of 7.3 hours post-holiday as businesses delay returning to the office or resuming on-premises operation. Here's a look at what some of them are offering. Remote work apps: Boom and crash China's enterprise software industry has been slow to take off in comparison to the West, though it's slowly picking up steam as the country's consumer-facing industry becomes crowded, prompting investors and tech behemoths to bet on more business-oriented services. Now remote work apps are witnessing a boom as millions are confined to working from home. The online education sector is experiencing a similar uptick as schools nationwide are suspended, according to data from research firm Sensor Tower.  The main players trying to tap the nationwide work-from-home practice are Alibaba's DingTalk, Tencent's WeChat  Work, and ByteDance's Lark. App rankings compiled by Sensor Tower show that all three apps experienced significant year-over-year growth in downloads from January 22 through February 20, though their user bases vary greatly: DingTalk: 1,446% Lark:",tech

(See 5:50 pm update). ” Meredith China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has warned citizens against traveling to the U.S., saying Chinese tourists had repeatedly been treated ""unfairly"" stateside. In an online statement published Monday, the ministry urged citizens to raise their awareness due to the U.S. security situation and ""excessive"" prevention measures. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Monday. China had urged its citizens against traveling to the U.S. in June 2019, at a time of heightened trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. ” Meredith The Wuhan Municipal government took its first step Monday towards loosening a city-wide lockdown that started on Jan. 23. A few hours later, however, city authorities canceled the policy change and said it was issued by a traffic control group and did not receive the approval of unnamed ""primary leaders."" As a result, travel restrictions remain as Wuhan works to implement Chinese President Xi Jinping's directive for limiting the coronavirus from spreading through the movement of people, the latest announcement said. The earlier online statement, now deleted, said people seeking treatment for special diseases or otherwise stranded in Wuhan could leave in batches during off-peak hours, as long as they followed certain procedures. The initial announcement came shortly after Xi's comments on Sunday that local authorities should take a ""precise"" approach when controlling the virus and smoothing travel. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province and accounts for the majority of deaths and confirmed cases of the coronavirus outbreak that began to emerge in December. ” Wu Stock markets around the world are selling off on Monday morning as spiking coronavirus cases in Italy, South Korea, and the Middle East sparked fears of further spread beyond China. South Korea's Kospi index closed down 3.9% while Italy's FTSE MIB plunged more than 900 points in early trade. The pan-European Stoxx 600 benchmark tumbled 3.5%, with Britain's FTSE 100, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX all falling sharply. Stateside, Dow futures were pointing to a loss of more than 700 points at Monday's open, with futures on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also falling. ” Smith Iran's deputy health minister has reportedly confirmed that up to 61 people have contracted the coronavirus, with 12 deaths nationwide. Speaking during a news conference on state television on Monday, Iran's Iraj Harirchi said most of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been in the city of Qom. Earlier on Monday, China's National Health Commission reported an additional 409 cases of the coronavirus, with 150 deaths. That brings the total number of confirmed infections to 77,150, with 2,592 deaths nationwide. (See 10:58 a.m. update). ” Meredith Chinese leaders decided Monday to postpone the third session of the 13th National People's Congress, according to state media. No future date was given. The congressional meeting was originally set to begin March 5 and is a key annual event in Beijing at which China releases its economic targets for the year, including GDP. Since a new pneumonia-causing virus began spreading in the last several weeks, Chinese authorities have discouraged locals from traveling and gathering together. The postponement marks the first time since China adopted the current March schedule in 1995 for the meeting of parliament, Reuters reported. ” Cheng China's fast-spreading coronavirus could see Asia lose more than $100 billion in tourism receipts, ING said in a research note published Monday. Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research for Asia-Pacific at ING, said the Dutch financial group had assumed zero tourism receipts from Asian tourists visiting China and Chinese tourists flying to Asia. This is a ""gross simplification,"" Carnell said, but it fits a scenario where the outbreak lingers long after it peaks. ""Official travel restrictions may be slow to be removed, and travelers may remain wary long after it is safe for them to travel again,"" he said. Tourism revenue contributed around 11% of China's GDP in 2018, according to Trading Economics. ” Abigail Ng Italian stocks plunged in early trade Monday morning, as the euro zone's third-largest economy grappled with the largest coronavirus outbreak outside of Asia. European markets screeched lower in early deals with the FTSE MIB index trading 990 points down at 23,808, or 4% lower. Shares of Italian banks fell sharply while the stock of Juventus soccer club was briefly halted after falling 11%. There are widespread concerns over the spread of the virus in northern Italy; the country now has 152 confirmed cases and four deaths due to the virus as of Monday morning, with a sharp spike in cases over the weekend. ” Ellyatt South Korea has confirmed an additional 70 cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections nationwide to 833. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that most of the new cases came from the southeastern city of Daegu. An earlier briefing reported a further 161 people had contracted the deadly flu-like virus. (See 9:24 a.m. update). It means the country has reportedly registered a record daily spike of the coronavirus, with 231 additional cases confirmed on Monday. ” Meredith North Korea has reportedly quarantined 380 foreigners as part of efforts to prevent the coronavirus outbreak. The majority of those quarantined are thought to be diplomats stationed in the capital city of Pyongyang, Yonhap news agency reported Monday, citing state media in North Korea. It was not immediately clear how long the quarantine period would last, while the nationalities of those in isolation have not yet been revealed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said it has had no indication of COVID-19 having spread to North Korea. ” Meredith Work is picking up in China's top three exporting provinces, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. For industrial enterprises greater than a certain scale, the resumption of work has topped 90% in Zhejiang province, and more than 70% in Guangdong and Jiangsu, officials said. That refers to enterprises with annual revenue of at least 20 million yuan ($2.86 million) from their primary business operations. Nationwide, coal mine production is around 76%, food processing at 70%, and railcar load has recovered to about 95% to pre-Lunar New Year holiday levels, the commission said. Iron and steel production is about 67% and that of nonferrous metals has resumed at a rate of around 86%. Some companies, especially medium and small businesses, have encountered great difficulties in their production and operations due to the impact of the virus, according to NDRC Party Secretary Cong Liang. He maintained that the virus's effect on China's economy is short-term. Due to these pressures on growth, Human Resources and Social Security Assistant Minister You Jun said the impact on employment is ""not small,"" and that agriculture workers and college graduates will face greater difficulties. ” Cheng China's largest province by exports, Guangdong, and the coal-producing province of Shanxi have lowered their emergency response level to two, while Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Liaoning each lowered theirs to level three. The downgrade allows local authorities to respond to region-specific needs and follows a decrease in newly confirmed cases outside Hubei province, the epicenter of the disease. Out of 398 such cases reported for Sunday, 11 came from provinces other than Hubei, according to China's National Health Commission. The lowered response level follows greater emphasis from the central government on maintaining economic growth. Chinese President Xi Jinping said Sunday that the virus is ""the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People's Republic of China"" and ""will inevitably deal a relatively big blow"" to the country's economy. He also said each region should adopt measures to resume work and production based on the local level of health risks, according to an English-language report from state news agency Xinhua. ” Wu Shares of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines fell more than 5% each following a spike in the number of confirmed cases in South Korea. As the total number of reported infections in the country jumped to more than 700, both airlines took steps to cancel flights to the city of Daegu, where many of the new cases have been detected. Asiana Airlines suspended flights between Daegu and Jeju until Mar. 9 (see 10:45 am update). Reuters reported that Korean Air also halted all flights to the city until Mar. 28. Low-cost carrier Air Busan sold off 3.89%. ” Roy Choudhury China's National Health Commission reported an additional 150 deaths and 409 new confirmed cases as of Feb. 23. Of the 409 new cases, 398 came from Hubei province, whereas only 11 were reported in the rest of mainland China. That brought the nationwide tally of total infections to 77,150 confirmed cases and 2,592 deaths. The Hubei Provincial Health Committee reported 149 additional deaths in the province, including 131 in Wuhan, where the pneumonia-like virus was first detected. As of Feb. 23, Hubei province has reported a total of 64,287 confirmed cases, 2,495 deaths. The commission said 16,738 people have been discharged from the hospital. ” Roy Choudhury South Korea's second-largest carrier, Asiana Airlines, said it was suspending domestic flights between Daegu and Jeju from Feb. 25 until Mar. 9. Many of the new cases reported in the country came from the city of Daegu. (see 9:24 am and 7 am updates) ” Roy Choudhury The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an additional 161 cases on Monday morning, bringing the total to 763 nationwide. Most of the new confirmed cases were reported in the city of Daegu. An additional two people were said to have died, which brought the death toll to seven. ” Roy Choudhury The benchmark Kospi index was down more than 2% in early trade while the Kosdaq fell 2.25%. The sudden spike in cases (see 7 am update) spooked investors as experts weigh on the economic impact the disease could have on the country. ""Economic difficulty is imminent,"" Citi economists said in a Monday morning note. ""Fear of the virus is spreading throughout the country, at a much faster rate than the virus itself."" Citi said it did not expect the economic fallout to be limited to certain regions and cities. ""Consumption is declining as to minimize human contact, & stores & factories are shutting down for various reasons”exposure to virus; lack of supply inputs; or continuing loss."" ” Roy Choudhury The coronavirus outbreak is a major public health emergency that has spread rapidly and has become difficult to contain, President Xi Jinping said at a meeting in Beijing on Sunday, state media Xinhua reported. ""This is both a crisis and a big test for us,"" Xi said, per Xinhua's translations of his remarks, adding that efforts are being made to cure people of the infection, reduce fatality rates, safeguard social stability, and strengthen China's emergency medical supplies and daily necessities. The epidemic's impact on China's economic and social development is temporary and generally manageable, but it will deal a relatively big blow in the short term, Xi said, according to Xinhua. The president also stressed the importance of an orderly resumption of work and production. ” Roy Choudhury The coronavirus outbreak that began in China and has since spread to more than 25 countries could put global economic recovery at risk, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement following a G-20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Saudi Arabia. ""This is a human tragedy, but it also has negative economic impact,"" Georgieva said. ""I reported to the G20 that even in the case of rapid containment of the virus, growth in China and the rest of the world would be impacted. Of course, we all hope for a V-shaped, rapid recovery ” but given the uncertainty, it would be prudent to prepare for more adverse scenarios."" ” Roy Choudhury South Korea's government raised the COVID-19 alert to its highest level after a recent explosion of confirmed infection cases, which took the country's tally from 31 as of Feb. 18 to 602 on Sunday. Many of the new cases were from the city of Daegu and were related to a homegrown religious group, Yonhap reported. At least five people have died from the virus, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By comparison, the Diamond Princess cruise that had been quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan, since early February had at least 634 confirmed cases, according to the Japanese health ministry and the World Health Organization. Many countries have started evacuating their citizens from the ship and some people have tested positive after leaving the ship. ” Roy Choudhury All times below are in Eastern time. Israel may quarantine some 200 visitors from South Korea at a military base in a Jewish settlement on the occupied West Bank over coronavirus fears, according to Israel's Ynet news site. Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said separately he had ordered South Korea and Japan to be added to a list of Asian countries to which travel to and from Israel was being barred. ” Lovelace Jr. Austria has halted train traffic with its southern neighbor amid concern that two passengers on an in-bound train from Italy were infected with the coronavirus.

"Sarah Westwood, CNN",2/23/2020,cnn,White House expected to ask Congress for coronavirus money this week,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/politics/coronavirus-congress-white-house-funding/index.html," White House officials are expected to ask Congress for emergency funding this week to battle the coronavirus amid growing fears of a larger outbreak in the US, two officials familiar with the forthcoming request said. Government aides worked throughout the weekend on the supplemental request, which is still not final but could be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as Monday, according to a person familiar with the plans. That source said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has ruffled feathers through the process by requesting amounts of money that ""have been seen as largely out of proportion."" The source noted HHS already has money that could be used for coronavirus issues, but claimed Azar ""has been pushing hard for this to overcompensate"" for management decisions regarding coronavirus containment that the source criticized. The US now has 35 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Fourteen Americans who tested positive for the disease returned to the US this week after spending weeks in isolation on the luxury cruise ship Diamond Princess docked in Japan. A spokesperson for HHS referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget. Read More Another person familiar with the talks vehemently disagreed with the characterization that Azar had asked for too much funding or mismanaged any part of the coronavirus response effort. An HHS spokesperson noted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already notified Congress of its intent to spend up to $66 million from its Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. The supplemental funding request was first reported by Politico. The discussions about funding come as the Trump Administration has grappled with how to deal with the rapidly-spreading disease, including what to do with those Americans on board that cruise ship who were flown back to the US to continue quarantine. President Donald Trump downplayed concern about the contagion on Sunday as he departed the White House for India, claiming his administration has the virus ""very much under control in this country."" ""It's a big situation going on throughout the world, and I can say that the Unites States, we've pretty much closed our doors in certain areas and about certain areas and lose certain areas,"" he told reporters. ""We have the greatest doctors in the world, we have it under control, we accepted a few people -- a very small amount of people, they're very well confined, and they should be getting better fairly soon. Very interestingly, we have no deaths."" Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the outbreak in China, claiming Xi has worked ""very, very hard"" to contain the virus. The Trump administration has suspended all commercial flight traffic from China and has imposed quarantine orders on certain people who have recently spent time in China if they attempt to return to the US. Officials were still working on the supplemental request heading into Sunday afternoon and the precise amount of funding has not yet been set. But the preparations to ask Congress for more money represents a significant step in the administration's response to the global outbreak of the virus, which originated in China. Although the White House initially took a measured approach to handling the virus, administration officials earlier this month issued travel bans, quarantine orders and increased mandatory screenings as officials evaluated the growing threat posed by the illness.

Meeks, who's known for running the world's largest tech fund during the dot-com boom, sees 20% pullback risks growing as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. ""There is some comeuppance due, and unfortunately I think the coronavirus is that exogenous variable that is a catalyst to take some of these stocks down,"" the portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday. The major indexes ended the week meaningfully lower after a series of new coronavirus cases sparked fresh concerns over a global economic slowdown. Tech stocks led Friday's sell-off. The Nasdaq had its worst daily performance since last month. Meeks, who has been avoiding the space, suggests Friday's activity may be the tip of the iceberg. If the outbreak isn't contained soon, Meeks believes the next serious tech sell-off could be longer and deeper than his original prediction almost a year ago. Last April, he warned on ""Trading Nation"" the tech rally had gone too far, too fast and he has been singling out Apple. He still owns the iPhone maker's stock, but as an underweight. ""Apple is grossly overvalued,"" said Meeks, who has $700 million in assets under management. Meeks may have a discouraging forecast, but he's not predicting a recession. ""The fundamentals are strong in tech,"" he added. ""They are stronger relative to the rest of the sectors within the economy."" If big tech has a dramatic drop similar to the fourth quarter of 2018, Meeks indicated he'd head back to the group that made him famous. ""I'd be buying with both hands,"" he said. Meeks would target semiconductors, particularly Lam Research, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron and Applied Materials. ""I'm most bullish on the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment companies,"" Meeks said. ""You've had some companies that have already reported their results.

"Stephen Jewkes, Elvira Pollina",2/23/2020,reuters,Italy battles 'explosion' of coronavirus cases as third patient dies,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-italy/italy-battles-explosion-of-coronavirus-cases-as-third-patient-dies-idUSKCN20H0A3,"Italy raced on Sunday to contain the biggest outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, sealing off the worst affected towns and banning public events in much of the north as a third patient died of the illness. Authorities in the wealthy regions of Lombardy and Veneto, which are the focal point of the flare-up, ordered schools and universities to close for at least a week, shut museums and cinemas and called off the last two days of the Venice Carnival. The civil protection unit said the number of cases of the highly contagious virus totaled 152, all but three of them coming to light since Friday. I was surprised by this explosion of cases, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told state broadcaster RAI, warning that the numbers would likely rise in the coming days. We will do everything we can to contain the contagion, he said. The latest death was an elderly woman from the town of Crema, some 45 km (28 miles) east of Italy's financial capital Milan. Like at least one of the other people who have died, she had been suffering from serious underlying health issues, officials said. The number of certified cases of the illness in Lombardy rose to 110 from 54 a day earlier, while in Veneto some 21 people were diagnosed with the virus, including two people in Venice, which was packed with tourists for carnival season. Health officials reported isolated cases in the neighboring regions of Piedmont and Emilia Romagna. The regional governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said he had dealt with numerous natural disasters during his long career, including floods and earthquakes. But this is the absolutely worst problem that Veneto has faced, he told reporters. Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine, with locals urged to stay home and special permission needed to enter or leave the designated areas. In Milan, residents rushed to stock up on essentials, while some parents decided to take their children out of the city. Today is madness. It feels like we're in Baghdad. We can't restock shelves quick enough, said a shop assistant at the Esselunga Solari supermarket in Milan, declining to give her name because she was not authorized to speak to the media. Lombardy and Veneto together account for 30% of Italy's gross domestic output. Any prolonged disruption there is likely to have a serious impact on the whole economy, which is already close to recession. Tourism looks certain to take an immediate hit, with schools across the country calling off trips, including traditional week-long skiing holidays. Milan's famous La Scala opera house canceled performances and bars and discos in Lombardy were told to close by 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). Some major sporting events were postponed, including four Serie A soccer matches scheduled for Sunday. Health authorities are trying to work out how the outbreak in the north started. Initial suspicion in Lombardy fell on a businessman recently returned from China, the epicenter of the new virus, but he has tested negative. In Veneto, doctors tested a group of eight Chinese visitors who had been to the town that was home to the first fatality, but again, they tested negative. We are (now) even more worried because if we cannot find patient zero' then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought, Zaia said. Before Friday, Italy had reported just three cases of the virus - all of them people who had recently arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the illness emerged late last year. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was concerned by the upsurge in new cases and a lack of clarity over its spread. I am sending a ... team to Italy to work together to learn about virus spread and (how to) contain it, the WHO's European Regional Director Hans Kluge said on Twitter.

Authorities in the two regions, where the outbreak is concentrated, have cancelled sports events, including three top league soccer games, and closed schools and universities. Companies from Ray-Ban owner Luxottica to the country's top bank UniCredit have told workers living in the affected areas to stay home. Lombardy and Veneto represent Italy's industrial heart and jointly account for 30% of gross domestic output. With an emergency decree passed at a meeting in the headquarters of Italy's civil protection agency, the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. Competent ministers will also be able to halt sports events and school trips outside those areas. I've wondered myself why so many cases in Italy ... and the answer is in the rigorous and meticulous controls our country has adopted from the start, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at a late night press conference. Italy's first victim was a 76-year-old woman who was found dead at her home 50 km (30 miles) south of Milan on Thursday and tested positive for the coronavirus. A 78-year-old man died of the infection in a hospital near Padua on Friday night. The man's wife and daughter are among 17 people infected by the coronavirus in the Veneto region, where authorities are considering suspending Carnival of Venice events currently taking place. There are 54 cases in nearby Lombardy, including a man currently at San Raffaele hospital in Milan. The city, where Women's Fashion Week is underway, has a population of 1.4 million. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani said his fashion show on Sunday would take place in an empty theatre without any press or buyers present to safeguard their health. Milan's prosecutors office said it would not reopen on Monday and remain closed until further notice. Organisers of the world's biggest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, on Saturday postponed to the end of May the event which had been due to take place in Milan in a week. The outbreak originated in Codogno, a small town southeast of Milan where Lombardy's first infected patient, a 38-year-old man now in stable condition, was treated. All those who have tested positive are people who on Feb. 18-19 had contacts with the emergency room and the hospital of Codogno, Regional Health Councillor Giulio Gallera said, adding 259 people had been screened in the area in the past two days and 35 had tested positive. A contagion rate of 13% is quite strong, he said. Some 50,000 residents in Codogno and nine nearby towns have been advised to remain indoors. Public gatherings including Sunday church services and football matches have been suspended, and schools and shops have been closed. Similar measures were adopted in the small Veneto town of Vo' Euganeo where the male victim lived, and in other places. Conte said further school shutdowns outside the outbreak epicentre would be up to local authorities. Italy was the first euro zone country to suspend all direct flights to and from China, after two Chinese tourists from the badly hit city of Wuhan tested positive in Rome in late January. The Chinese tourists and an Italian national repatriated from Wuhan were the only three cases in Italy until Friday.

All times below are in Beijing time. President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated his belief that Chinese Premier Xi Jinping is doing a ""good job"" combating the fast-spreading coronavirus and that Xi will ""solve"" the problem. He added that the virus is ""under control"" in the U.S. There were 35 confirmed cases of the virus in the U.S. as of Sunday morning. Turkey is closing its border with Iran to stop infections from spreading, the country's health ministry announced Sunday. The moves come as Iran reported 43 cases and eight deaths from the virus. All highways and railways connecting Turkey to Iran will be closed as of 5 p.m. local time, health minister Fahrettin Koca said, adding that flights from Iran would also be suspended. Italian authorities are canceling the Venice carnival, an annual event that had already drawn thousands, as it rushes to contain the coronavirus rapidly spreading in the country's north. The event started on Saturday and would have run until Tuesday. Schools, universities, museums and other public spaces will be closed in Venice and the surrounding region of Veneto in a shutdown set to last through at least Mar. 1. Italy's cases of the new coronavirus have soared from 18 to 133 over the course of the weekend. A sixth person has died from the coronavirus in South Korea, the country's Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention said Sunday evening. South Korea's new cases jumped by 169 over the weekend, bringing the its total infected to 602. Chinese Premier Xi Jinping said the coronavirus situation in China is still ""serious and complex,"" according to a Reuters translation of state media. He also said that the country would maintain a ""prudent"" monetary policy, and would introduce new policy measures in a timely way, Reuters reported. ""This is a crisis for us and it is a big test,"" Xi said, calling it the ""largest public health emergency"" since communist China's establishment in 1949. China is the epicenter of the new coronavirus, with 76,936 cases and 2,442 deaths on the mainland as of Feb. 22. Many businesses and schools remain shut, with economists predicting an economic growth slowdown for the country of 1.4 billion. A third passenger of the virus-stricken cruise ship Diamond Princess has died, Japanese health officials said Sunday. The patient, who officials said was removed from the ship after testing positive for the new coronavirus, was a Japanese man in his 80s said to be already suffering from other respiratory ailments. The statement from Japan's health minister cited the cause of death as pneumonia. The two prior passenger deaths were also Japanese citizens in their 80s. More than 600 people on the cruise chip, docked in Japan's Yokohama Bay, have tested positive for the virus despite to weeks of quarantine. The ship holds the highest concentration of infected people outside of mainland China, where the virus has taken the greatest toll. Iran has confirmed a new death from the coronavirus, bringing its total fatalities in the country to eight. Iran now has 43 confirmed cases of infection, Iranian health ministry officials said Sunday, according to Reuters.

Italy's norther region of Lombardy announced a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases to 89, bringing the country's total over 100, the region's governor said Sunday. Italy has the highest number of confirmed cases in Europe. In the two worst-hit regions of Lombardy and Veneto, sports events have been canceled, and authorities closed schools and universities, according to a Reuters report. A dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown on Saturday after the deaths of the two infected people, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. South Korea, which reported 556 cases of the new coronavirus just Sunday morning, has confirmed another 46, bringing the total to 602, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Sunday afternoon. Over 50% of the new cases originated in a church in the city of Daegu, in the country's south-east, after a 61-year-old woman who went to services there tested positive for the illness last week, Reuters reported. The woman is known as ""Patient 31."" France's tourism sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, the country's finance minister said Sunday. ""We have less tourists, of course, in France, about 30%, 40% less than expected,"" Bruno Le Maire told CNBC on Sunday at the G-20 meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Tourism accounts for nearly 8% of France's gross domestic product. It welcomes around 2.7 million Chinese tourists each year, which Le Maire said ""won't be the same, of course, in 2020."" France has reported 12 confirmed cases of the virus and one death, according to a WHO report dated Feb. 22. South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the country of 51 million on its highest possible alert Sunday as confirmed coronavirus cases leap to more than 600 in just a few days. The alert β’ Level 4, or ""serious"" β’ allows the government to lock down cities and take other powerful measures to contain the disease's outbreak, which has so far caused 5 deaths in the country. ""The coming few days will be a critical time for us,"" Mr. Moon said at an emergency meeting on Sunday. ""This will be a momentous time when the central government, local governments, health officials and medical personnel and the entire people must wage an all-out, concerted response to the problem."" Japan's health minister has issued an apology after a women who left the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess tested positive for the new coronavirus. The woman, reported to be in her 60s, was under quarantine on the ship for 14 days but tested positive during another test in Tochigi Prefecture, which is north of Tokyo. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato revealed that 23 people who had disembarked on Wednesday and Thursday had not undergone tests since before Feb. 5. The ministry was working to reach them for new testing, he told a press conference in Tokyo on Saturday night, according to Reuters. ""We deeply apologize for the situation caused by our oversight,"" Kato said. ""We will take all necessary measures, like double checks, to prevent a recurrence."" Hubei's government on Saturday said a 70-year-old man did not show any symptoms till 27 days later, although he was infected with the coronavirus. That suggested the incubation period could be longer than 14 days. A third chartered plane evacuating Hong Kong residents from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan arrived home on Sunday morning, according to a South China Morning Post report. The five residents on the plane were among more than 200 who have been evacuated since Thursday. They are all serving out a two-week quarantine period in Hong Kong. As of Saturday, there were 70 confirmed cases in the city, said the report. China's National Health Commission reported 648 new confirmed cases, and 97 additional deaths as of Feb. 22. That brings the mainland's total to 76,936 cases, and 2,442 deaths. South Korea reported a jump of 123 new cases, bringing the country's total to 556 infected, according to the country's for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday morning. It also reported two more deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to four. More of half of the cases have been linked to outbreaks at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in country's fourth-largest city Daegu. More than 1,000 people who attended the church have reported flu-like symptoms. Of the 123 new cases, 63 are from the church in Daegu, according to the health authority. Officials are also investigating a possible link between churchgoers and the spike in infections at the Cheongdo hospital, where more than 110 people have been infected so far, mostly patients at a mental illness ward. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics on Saturday confirmed one coronavirus case at its phone factory in South Korea, which caused it to shut down the entire facility, according to Reuters. Infections in Italy saw a sharp spike, surging to 79 cases by Saturday, with two dead, according to the country's health ministry. In the two worst-hit regions of Lombardy and Veneto, sports events have been canceled, and authorities closed schools and universities, according to a Reuters report. Serie A soccer matches in those regions will not be played on Sunday. A dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown on Saturday after the deaths of the two infected people, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. Companies have told employees from virus-hit areas to stay at home, the report said. Lombardy and Veneto are the heart of Italy's industrial region and both make up 30% of gross domestic output. China's Hubei province reported 630 new confirmed cases, and 96 additional deaths, as of Feb. 22. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 64,084, and the death toll to 2,346. All times below are in Eastern time. The number of coronavirus cases tripled in South Korea on Saturday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with the number of confirmed cases in the country surging to 433 from 156 over a 24-hour period. The surge in cases adds to fears among health officials that the virus, which has spread to 28 countries, could turn into a global pandemic. More than half of the cases in South Korea are connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, and over a thousand members have reported potential symptoms of the virus. The area surrounding the Christian sect's church in Daegu, a major city in South Korea, has become empty as businesses there shutter. Chinese state media reported that seven ships brought into the city of Wuhan in Hubei province will be converted into temporary accommodations for medical staff in the city. Thousands of medical workers from across the country have been brought into Hubei to help the province contain the outbreak. Xinhua News reported that the ships normally operate as river cruises in the Three Gorges, a popular and scenic tourist area along the Yangtze River. The state news agency said, however, that the cruise ship business in the Three Gorges had been closed due to the outbreak. The move comes amid heightened scrutiny after hundreds of passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship contracted the new coronavirus. ”Wang World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with African officials from Geneva on Saturday morning to urge them to prepare for a potential spread of the coronavirus across Africa. Just one case has been confirmed on the continent, but health officials fear the increasing global spread of the virus, especially to countries with less developed health-care systems. WHO says it has shipped more than 30,000 sets of personal protective equipment to six countries in Africa, and is set to ship 60,000 more sets to 19 countries in upcoming weeks. It has also provided online training courses to 11,000 African health workers, as well as advice to countries on how to conduct screening, testing and treatment.

Wesley Hudson,2/23/2020,express,Coronavirus latest: Fears of major failure in quarantine - Virus can take WEEKS to show,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1246205/coronavirus-UK-latest-news-covid19-quarantine-length-china-hubei-pandemic-symptoms," The 70-year-old man was infected with the virus in China's Hubei province but took nearly four weeks to show any signs of the virus, the local government said. According to the Hubei government website, he had driven to Shennongjia, north-western Hubei, from eastern Ezhou, where he had close contact with his coronavirus infected sister on January 24. The pensioner, identified as Jiang, then developed a fever on February 20 and tested positive for coronavirus a day later. This case could change the current policy which presumes a 14-day incubation period is enough. The global epidemic has killed 2,548 people so far and infected a further 78,572. There is a surge in untraceable clusters of new coronavirus patients which has caused experts to warn that containment methods are not going to work. According to Dr Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the new virus spreads as easily as a common cold.   Dr Adalja said coronavirus is certainly being spread by people who show such mild symptoms that no one can tell. He added: If that's the case, all of these containment methods are not going to work. It's likely mixed in the cold and flu season all over the place, in multiple countries and gone unnoticed until someone gets severely ill. JUST IN: Coronavirus LIVE: Surge in UNTRACEABLE' patients as fears of pandemic  Ian Mackay, virus expert at Australia's University of Queensland, warned a global pandemic is on the way as the number of hotspots increases. He said: A number of spot fires, occurring around the world is a sign that things are ticking along. What we are going to have here is probably a pandemic. South Korea's president has said he was putting the country on red alert due to the rapid rise in new cases of the coronavirus.

Officials in Italy confirmed the first deaths of Europeans from the virus after two pensioners died. Neither had travelled to China, adding to fears the virus could spiral out of control.  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his government was maintaining an extremely high level of precaution after 45 people were diagnosed with the virus. The Italian authorities placed 50,000 people in lockdown in ten towns in Lombardy and Veneto, telling them to remain indoors. Thirty-two Brits and European passengers who were trapped on board the virus-riddled Diamond Princess cruise liner off the coast of Japan have been flown back to Britain.  The NHS confirmed more than 100 people who were placed in a quarantine facility in Milton Keynes are being released. For the past 14-days, 118 guests had been put in quarantine at the Kents Hill Park training and conference centre. The group, who were brought back to Britain earlier this month on a repatriation flight from Wuhan, included around 10 children and a family of four.

Wesley Hudson,2/23/2020,express,Brexit latest: Boris visibly' furious as official rejects PM's post-Brexit satellite plan,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1246144/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-conservative-british-space-programme-dominic-cummings," The Prime Minister came to a loggerhead with Whitehall's head of the Civil Service over a top-secret Β£5billion spy satellite project. In a meeting with Mr Johnson and his closest aide Dominic Cummings, Sir Mark Sedwell branded the project unrealistic and unaffordable and revealed his officials were working on a cheaper alternative. A visibly angry Mr Johnson then put his head in his hands and berated the head of the chief mandarin. He was met with negative comments about the space programme being months behind schedule. The Prime Minister snapped: Why am I only hearing about this now? Sir Mark replied he was going to tell you about it after this meeting. Mr Johnson retorted he had already announced the project and demanded Sir Mark got it back on track.   The UK currently relies on an American satellite system for navigational guidance of Britain's drones, missiles, ships and other espionage projects. Britain was leading the way in an EU system called Galileo but was ousted from the project in a Brexit spat with Brussels. The Prime Minister gave approval of the British alternative in one of his first acts in office. He said: Let's get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems “ UK assets orbiting in space with all the long-term strategic and commercial benefits for this country. JUST IN: Brexit negotiator makes brilliant point about EU regulations  It is understood officials, led by Sir Mark, want a cheaper system that would not be purely independent and sovereign. The row comes amid claims Mr Cummings is trying to wrestle control of space policies from the Business Department. In the Cabinet reshuffle, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Space Minister Chris Skidmore were sacked. It is understood Mr Cummings blamed them for agreeing to give the European Space Agency a further Β£1.8billion in funding last year. The advisor believed the money should have been spent on the new UK-only capabilities. Last year, Mr Skidmore said more than 50 companies were involved in the secret project. He claimed: The UK Space Agency won't let me go into detail about the specific companies, but next year, around March time, there will be a Β£5billion programme announced. We would want it fully delivered by 2030 but the first satellites would go up by 2025. Follow below for live Brexit updates  04:30pm update: UK fisheries ready for French disruption' as angry Paris prepare blockades British fishermen are readying for a post-Brexit ""disruption"" with France as fears grow fisheries from across the channel are preparing blockades. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French minister of Europe and foreign affairs, warned last week that if European boats were barred from UK waters, France would press for British trawlers to be prevented from selling their catches on the continent. Barrie Deas of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO) said he fully expects blockades from France. He told The Observer: French fishermen have done it for much less. I would imagine there will be disruption. 04.00pm update: UK fisheries tell Boris PUT IT RIGHT' after being treated as a bargaining chip' with EU Boris Johnson has been told not to waste the ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to restore British waters to UK fishermen ahead of trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union. The Prime Minister will officially kick off negotiations with Brussels next month with the fishing industry set to be one of the major battle grounds between the two sides. Andrew Trevarton, chairman of the Mevagissey Fisherman's Association, has urged Mr Johnson to put right the great injustice suffered by British fishermen since the UK joined the EU and were bound by the controversial Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). 03.30pm update: IDS exposes Brussels infighting chaos as EU crumbles before Brexit trade talks even begin Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that the European Union's unity is quickly disintegrating ahead of the fast approaching Brexit trade talks. The EU is falling apart before the Brexit trade talks even take place, according to Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith. The prominent Brexiteer remarked that the severe impact that Brexit will have on the European bloc was only just beginning to sink in. Speaking on BBC 5Live, Mr Smith suggested that the fear the EU would be tough on the UK during the talks was rapidly unravelling. 02.30pm update: Prime Minister draws up 'hit list' of senior civil servants Boris Johnson has drawn up a ""hit list"" of senior civil servants he wants turfed out of Whitehall so they cannot sabotage his Brexit agenda. A major shake-up of government departments puts three permanent secretaries in the firing line of Number 10. Downing Street feels emboldened to make swingeing defenestrations with the PM's huge mandate. 02.00pm update: Boris Johnson's Brexit team seeks to evade Irih Sea checks on goods. The Prime Minister and his team was asked to draw up plans to ""get around"" the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Officials believe that Suella Braverman, the new UK attorney-general, may need to give fresh legal advice to justify the move. France on Wednesday said it was imperative that negotiations over a future trade relationship between Britain and the EU included customs checks in the Irish Sea. Mr Johnson's cabinet will meet on Tuesday to sign off on the proposals, which will then be presented in parliament and published on Thursday.   01.00pm update: Downing Street fury as doctors will be banned from coronavirus warnings to patients under EU rules Doctors will be banned from warning patients about the risks of coronavirus under EU rules that are set to become law in Britain despite Breit. Public bodies could face being fined up to Β£17million by Brussels if they send unsolicited messages by text or email “ even as part of a public health campaign. The plan has caused fury in Downing Street because of the role of UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who is working to put EU data protection laws into a statutory code that the Government would have no power to amend. One senior Government source last night described Ms Denham as an ""unelected anti-Brexit pen-pusher"". 12.30pm update: Boris johnson told to scrap 'insane' EU rule An EU rule means you will need insurance for ride-on lawnmowers and tractors. The Prime Minister was urged urged to scrap law which leaves homeowners facing prosecution for driving any 'vehicle' without insurance on own property. Ride-on lawnmowers, golf carts and tractors will be required to have motor insurance as a result of an EU rule taking effect in the UK after Brexit despite being described as ""insane"" by Mr Johnson. 12.00pm update: UK to reveal EU negotiating demands The UK is preparing to detail its demands for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Ministers are expected to recommit to seeking to obtain a Canada-style agreement in the negotiating mandate scheduled for publication on Thursday. But this could set up a clash with the EU after its chief negotiator Michel Barnier ruled out the possibility the UK can have the same deal as the North American nation. The Government is expected to publish its negotiating mandate for a desired free trade agreement with the US the following week. The EU member states are expected to adopt their negotiating position on Tuesday. Brussels is yet to publish its negotiating mandate but a leaked draft reportedly included a stipulation the UK must return unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin.  11.30am update: Brexit bombshell: Will deal create chaos for UK's time zones? BREXIT could result in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK falling into different time zones, creating ""havoc"", an expert has warned. Dr Heather Rolfe, head of research at Demos, recently represented the UK-based think tank at the European Union committee on the EU internal market about discontinuing seasonal changes. Dr Rolfe revealed to Express.co.uk how the proposals could lead to complications for the Irish border. 11.00am update: Tory minister fails to confirm ban on import of chlorinated chicken in US trade deal The newly-elected environment secretary failed to offer a clear commitment that the import of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef will be off the table in any trade deal with the US. George Eustice said the government had ""no plans"" to change the ban on the two products but did not give a guarantee on the issue. it is expected to prove a crunch point in trade talks with Donald Trump's administration. His predecessor Theresa Villiers gave a firm commitment that British markets would not be flooded with chlorine washed chicken, which is legal in the US. 10.30am update: EU's Brexit position unravels: Barnier fears negotiating 'disaster' as Brussels row erupts THE EU's negotiating position on Brexit is quickly unravelling, according to Brussels insiders, who fear the ongoing row is a ""disaster"" and plays right ""into the hands of the Britsh"". The EU still hasn't finalised its negotiating strategy for the Brexit trade talks with the deadline less than three days away. There is growing panic in Brussels that the EU could miss the deadline for its final negotiating strategy, which would be a disaster for the talks. EU officials told the BBC's Adam Fleming that missing the Tuesday deadline would play right into the hands of the Brits. Negotiations between the UK and the EU are due to start in the first week of March. 10.00am update: Emmanuel Macron 'not sure' of UK-EU trade deal by end of year French President Emmanuel Macron has said he is ""not sure"" a UK-EU trade deal will be struck by 31 December, the end of the Brexit transition period. Mr Macron said negotiations starting in March will be ""tense"", with fishing rights a key point of contention. Mr Macron said at a meeting with fishermen in Paris on Saturday: ""I am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year. ""Anyway, it is going to become more tense because the British are very hard."" 9.30am update: Brexit trade talks blasted by No10 as UK lashes out at 'divided and distracted' EU Downing Street mocked the European Union for its bizarre behaviour in the run-up to Brexit trade talks Sources close to Prime Minister Boris Johnson point to the EU's delay in publishing its negotiation mandate and last week's chaos over its budget. The recent suggestion by the EU that the Elgin Marbles could be part of a price of a trade deal has been dismissed out of hand. A source close to the British negotiations said: On the UK side, progress has been remarkably smooth, with a clear decision-making framework in place and a sense of unity among ministers. By contrast, the EU seems divided, distracted by other issues like marbles, instead of the important decisions on what our trading relationship will actually look like. ""The new plan is for them to approve their mandate on February 25 but it is anyone's guess whether they will. 9.00 am update: Fury as real cost of Big Ben bongs nowhere near Β£500k quoted for Brexit night EXPERTS who said it could cost Β£500,000 for Big Ben to ring out on the night Britain left the EU have admitted they got their sums wrong for earlier chimes. The House of Commons Commission, responsible for Parliament maintenance, has revealed the cost for the bell to ring on New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday was Β£14,200, half its original figure. It had also come up with the huge figure for restoring Big Ben's bongs for Brexit night, something that never happened. Conservative MP Mark Francois, who was a leading campaigner for Big Ben to ring on Brexit night, said he would now take Commons estimates about the cost of restoring Parliament with a quarry full of salt.

"Yilei Sun, Shivani Singh",2/23/2020,reuters,"New coronavirus cases fall in China, but WHO concerned by global spread",https://www.reuters.com/article/china-health-idCNL4N2AL2U7,"China reported a sharp fall in new deaths and cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, but world health officials warned it was too early to make predictions about the outbreak as new infections continued to rise in other countries. Chinese authorities said the mainland had 397 new confirmed cases on Friday, down from 889 a day earlier. The numbers surged elsewhere, though, with outbreaks worsening in South Korea, Iran, Italy and Lebanon. In South Korea, authorities said on Saturday the number of new infections had doubled to 433, and suggested the tally could rise significantly as more than 1,000 people who attended a church at the center of the outbreak reported flu-like symptoms. The World Health Organization welcomed the reported decline in new Chinese cases, but said it was concerned about the number of new infections elsewhere with no clear link to China such as travel history or contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, as the disease caused by the virus is known. Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for COVID-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The U.N. agency is calling for $675 million to support most vulnerable countries, he said, adding 13 countries in Africa are seen as a priority because of their links to China. In total, China has reported 75,569 cases to the WHO, and 2,239 deaths, Tedros said. According to available data, the disease remains mild in 80% of patients, and severe or critical in 20%. The virus has been fatal in 2% of reported cases. The disease has spread to some 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing more than a dozen people, according to a Reuters tally. The latest Chinese figures showed only 31 of the new cases on Friday were outside of the virus epicenter of Hubei province, the lowest number since the National Health Commission started compiling nationwide data a month ago. But new, albeit isolated findings about the coronavirus could complicate efforts to thwart it, including the Hubei government's announcement on Saturday that an elderly man took 27 days to show symptoms after infection, almost twice the presumed 14-day incubation period. That follows Chinese scientists reporting that a woman from Wuhan had traveled 400 miles (675 km) and infected five relatives without showing signs of infection. State television showed the arrival in Wuhan of the blue whale on Saturday, the first of seven river cruise ships it is bringing in to house medical workers, tens of thousands of which have been sent to Hubei to contain the virus. In Italy, the worst-affected country in Europe, the virus has killed two people - a man and a woman in their 70s - and infected another 51 mostly in the north. Some 50,000 residents in Codogno, southwest of Milan, and nearby towns have been advised to remain indoors. Public gatherings including Sunday masses and football matches have been suspended, and schools and shops have been closed down. Iran, which had no reported cases earlier this week, on Saturday announced the detection of 10 new cases of coronavirus and two more deaths, appearing to bring the number of infections to 29 and the number of deaths to six. Japan, which confirmed 14 new cases on Saturday, faces growing questions about whether it is doing enough to contain its outbreak and whether the virus could disrupt this year's Tokyo Olympics. Organizers postponed the start of training for volunteers as a precaution. The potential economic impact of the outbreak, which has caused massive disruption to businesses in China, overshadowed a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Saudi Arabia. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, presenting the fund's outlook to central bankers and finance ministers in Riyadh, said the virus would likely lower China's economic growth this year to 5.6%, down 0.4 percentage points from its January outlook, and shave 0.1 percentage points from global growth. Asian policymakers sought to soothe investors' fears over the outbreak, which has roiled global markets, with equities sliding on Friday. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the yen's recent declines were largely driven by a strong dollar, shrugging off some market views that the virus epidemic is triggering an outflow of funds from Asia. Senior Chinese central bank officials, meanwhile, played down worries about the potential damage to the world's second-largest economy, saying the country's financial system and currency were resilient. Chen Yulu, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said policymakers had plenty of tools to support the economy, and were confident of winning the war against the epidemic. We believe that after this epidemic is over, pent-up demand for consumption and investment will be fully released, and China's economy will rebound swiftly, Chen told state TV.

Adam Chapman,2/22/2020,express,Steve Harley health latest: Cockney Rebel singer reveals polio diagnosis - symptoms,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1245032/steve-harley-health-latest-polio-symptoms-treatment-cockney-rebel,"  Steve Harley cut his teeth as a musician busking in the late 60s before forming Cockney Rebel with former folk music partner, Crocker, in 1972. The project gathered momentum throughout the early seventies, culminating in the release of the track ""Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me), which would go on to be a UK number one single in February 1975, and the band's biggest selling hit. Steve is regarded as a prominent figure in the glam rock scene that emerged in the early 70s, but his musical success was far from certain. In his childhood the singer was struck down with polio, a serious viral infection. Speaking to the Mail Online, the 70's rock star recalled the chilling events that led up to his diagnosis. Steve's father was a semi-professional footballer in the 1940s and Steve, the second of five, was always kicking a ball. In 1954, when he was three, it was noticed he was clumsy. READ MORE: Stephanie Davis health: The pain took over my mind, body and soul' Star's difficult time I kept stumbling. I ached, I was lethargic, Steve revealed. One night, as his dad went to check on him in bed, he noticed that Steve, who should have been asleep, was sweating profusely. His mum was quickly alerted to his condition. The boy told them he could not feel his leg. It was numb. A GP was called. She ran the points of scissors down my right leg and said, Ambulance. Now, recalled Steve. It was revealed soon after that Steve had a particularly severe case of polio.

Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]  This was only the beginning of Steve's ordeal, however, as he would spend the next four years, on and off, in hospital getting surgery to correct the damage caused by the polio. Steve said: The surgeon put pins in my good knee to stop that leg growing so I'd become more even. This is not what you would wish on your worst enemy. I was 12, I was in hospital for a year, I wanted to end life. It was pain¦ even now I can't describe it. According to the NHS, most people with polio don't have any symptoms and won't know they're infected.  But for some people, the polio virus causes temporary or permanent paralysis, which can be life threatening. Long-term complications can include: There's also a chance that someone who's had polio in the past will develop similar symptoms again, or worsening of their existing symptoms, many decades later, explained the NHS. According to the NHS you can become infected with the polio virus if you come into contact with the poo (faeces) of someone with the infection, or with the droplets launched into the air when they cough or sneeze.  You can also get the infection from food or water that's been contaminated with infected poo or droplets. Fortunately, polio no longer poses a risk in the UK because the vaccine used nowadays contains an inactive version of the virus. There's currently no cure for polio. Treatment focuses on supporting bodily functions and reducing the risk of long-term problems while the body fights off the infection, explains the NHS. This can include bed rest in hospital, painkillers, breathing support and regular stretches or exercises to prevent problems with the muscles and joints, it adds.

Anne Quito,2/22/2020,qz,Coronavirus hits 26 nations outside China amid containment doubts ” Quartz,https://qz.com/1806673/coronavirus-hits-26-nations-outside-china-amid-containment-doubts/,"Last month the World Health Organization issued a warning that the novel coronavirus epidemic in China could turn into a global health crisis. This week brought evidence that supports its worst fears. Despite massive efforts to contain Covid-19 in the outbreak epicenter Wuhan and surrounding areas, new cases have been reported in seemingly improbable places like Iran, Lebanon, and Italy. The window of opportunity is narrowing to contain the outbreak, warned WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a press briefing in Geneva yesterday. We have to prepare at the same time for any eventualities because this outbreak could go any direction. Indeed, the most recent numbers reflect an increasingly complicated global picture. According to the WHO's latest situation report (pdf), over 76,700 confirmed cases of infection have been reported worldwide, mostly in China but also now in 26 other countries. Seoul reported an eightfold increase in cases over four days, with 430-plus people in South Korea now infected. Two fatalities in northern Italy and four in Iran added to the grim death toll, now over 2,240 globally. Although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case, Tedros said. In effect, transmission is now happening between other countries independent of China and its containment efforts. Tedros, who served as Ethiopia's foreign minister prior to his appointment, said his organization's biggest worry is that Covid-19 may spread in countries with weaker health systems: If the virus arrives in a country already strained by other diseases”for example Congo, which is still fighting an Ebola outbreak”it will be even harder to control. The agency plans to ship 30,000 units of protective equipment, including face masks and thermometer guns, to vulnerable African countries. Meanwhile, African medical supplies factories, like one company Quartz visited in Nairobi, are working overtime to fulfill orders bound for China. What will happen if corona comes to Kenya? asked one business owner. There's nothing left for us. One confirmed case in Egypt shows Covid-19 has reached the continent. But aΒ  new projection published in the Lancet this week shows how the virus can spread rapidly through the region. The study suggests that Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa have the highest risk for importing the fast-spreading virus.",tech
Associated Press,2/22/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: northern Italian towns close schools and businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/coronavirus-northern-italian-towns-close-schools-and-businesses,"A dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. The secondary contagions prompted authorities in some Lombardy and Veneto towns to close schools, businesses and restaurants, and to cancel sporting events and religious services. The mayor of Milan, Italy's business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices. A 78-year-old man infected with the coronavirus died in Veneto, and a postmortem test performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, although it wasn't clear if illness from the virus caused her death. Hundreds of residents and workers who had come into contact with people who tested positive were put into isolation pending results of their tests. Civil protection crews set up a tent camp outside a closed hospital in Veneto to screen medical staff. In the town of Codogno, where the first patient identified in the northern cluster was in a critical condition, closed supermarkets, restaurants and shops made the main street practically a ghost town. The few people outside wore face masks, which were coveted items after selling out at pharmacies. Late Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died, and one who recovered. Of the remaining 76 people infected, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two “ a Chinese couple from Wuhan “ in Lazio, and one in Piedmont. Lombardy government authorities said the region's cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who had not travelled to China, but it remained unclear how this man had been infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services. Luca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said on Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures. You can get it from anyone, he told reporters. We can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact [with suspected carriers]. He added that while the virus isn't particularly lethal, it can be deadly for the elderly or people with existing conditions. However, the man who died in Veneto had not met the main risk factors for the virus when he was diagnosed with pneumonia two weeks ago. He had not travelled to China, nor come into contact with anyone who had. Therefore he was only tested for the virus after he did not respond to conventional pneumonia treatment, and by then it was too late, according to Francesca Russo, the head of healthcare for the Veneto region. Along with eight other infected people, the man who died formed a cluster in his hometown of Vo' Euganeo, population 3,300. Russo expressed relief that to date, none of the hospital personnel who treated the man have tested positive for the virus. Giulio Gallera, the Lombardy health and welfare ministry chief, also said that the region's cases comprised a traceable cluster, but that officials were still stumped about where it had originated from. The first person to fall ill had met with a man who had returned from China on 21 January, but this man tested negative for the virus and has been ruled out as the source. Other people had acquired their infections from the 38-year-old, either through contact with him or at the hospital in Codogno where he first received treatment on 18 February. More than 250 tests were completed in Lombardy, though hundreds more were being processed, including among the sick man's colleagues at a Unilever plant near Codogno where he worked, Gallera said. Given how contagious it is, it's possible the numbers will increase, he said. National and regional officials approved an ordinance that put 10 Lombardy towns in effective lockdown around Lodi, southeast of Milan, after the region reported a quadrupling of cases on Friday. But individual cities outside the area covered by the ordinance, such as Cremona, issued their own restrictions after confirming there were local cases. In Milan itself, however, Milan Fashion Week was wrapping up, though chatter about the rising numbers accompanied the runway shows. It doesn't seem to me in this moment for what regards our sector, our fashion week, that there are signs of danger,'' Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, told The Associated Press. We are tranquil and prudent. However, the world's largest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, announced it was putting off its Milan show until June because of the outbreak, and the postponement of three Serie A football matches has been confirmed. Despite the alarm, authorities urged calm and tried to balance precautionary closures with the economic reality of regions highly dependent on tourism and commerce. Hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though the floods in the lagoon city late last year are likely to have scared off visitors. This is not an Italian Wuhan', insisted Ivana Jelenic, president of the federation of Italian tourism and travel agencies, Fiavet. Avoiding all travel at this time would just be alarmist. In Rome, doctors at the Spallanzani infectious disease hospital treating the first three people in Italy found to be infected with the virus “ the Chinese couple from Wuhan and an Italian who contracted the virus in China “ reported encouraging news on an otherwise bleak day. The Italian patient who tested positive for the virus two weeks ago was cleared to leave the hospital, while one of the Chinese visitors tested negative for the first time. Separately on Saturday, 19 Italians who had spent more than two weeks quarantined on a virus-stricken cruise liner in Japan landed at Rome's military Pratica di Mare airport. They had been stranded on the Diamond Princess since 5 February. Following first health checks and a decontamination process, the passengers were transferred to the military campus of Cecchignola, where they will spend a 14-day isolation period.",general
Aurora Bosotti,2/22/2020,express,"Angela Merkel, what's next? Germany gears up for future without historic Chancellor",https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1245577/Angela-Merkel-news-resignation-Germany-AKK-CDU-leader-Merz-Rottgen-Laschet-latest," Angela Merkel announced at the last federal election in 2017 she would step down from the leadership of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and would not contest her seat as Chancellor in the next round of votes in 2021. Mrs Merkel set the record for the longest-serving leader of Germany, manning the helm of her country “ and some would say, the European Union “ for over 15 years. But growing criticism to her open-door policy at the height of the migration crisis, and the growing support for the right-wing Alternative fur Deutschland, paved the way to the Chancellor's decision to quit the role she won over for the first time in 2005. Prof Graham Timmins, from the Institute of German Studies at the University of Birmingham, suggested Mrs Merkel's decision to quit is part of a steady change in the political pattern of Germany. Speaking to Express.co.uk, Prof Timmins said: ""One of the reasons Merkel is standing down is the pressure of electoral defeat and the rise of the AfD. ""In many ways, the so-called big tent politics is now under real pressure. Go back 20 years, and it wasn't unusual for the CDU and the SPD to be polling something like 80 percent of the vote between them. ""It's unclear now, if there were a vote tomorrow, an election tomorrow, if they would scratch 40 percent combined."" JUST IN: Merkel 'could be dumped within weeks' as German Chancellor plummets in record-low polling   Prof Timmins added: ""So there's a huge amount of pressure on the Christian Democrat and also the other mainstream parties to respond to the rising radical agendas in Germany."" The question on who would succeed Angela Merkel at the helm of the country was believed to have been answered when protΓ©gΓ© Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is widely known as AKK in Germany, was selected as the next leader of the CDU in December 2018. But following a repeat of the less-than-stellar performance at the polls, and increasing pressure from within the party and the CDU's coalition partners in the Government, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer announced she, too, would step down and not lead the Christian Democrats to the 2021 Federal Elections. The race to take over resumed quickly after AKK confirmed she would resign, with five potential candidates vying for the top job. READ MORE: Angela Merkel speaks out following Hanau shooting - 'We stand against poisonous racism'  Friedrich Merz, who lost the leadership of the CDU to AKK in 2018, once again put his name forward and his business-friendly proposals, in addition to plans for stricter controls on immigration, are expected to win back some former voters who switched to supporting the AdD to protest Mrs Merkel's open-door policies. The leader of the populous North-Rhine Westphalia, Armin Laschet, is perceived as more of a continuity leader who could oppose the radical agenda of the German left and secure the support of the moderate liberals. Mr Laschet has yet to confirm whether he will effectively stand to succeed both Chancellor Merkel and AKK but his successful coalition with the Free Democrats have strengthened his chances should he indeed decide to have a go at the role. And former Environment Minister Norbert RΓ¶ttgen, who was fired from his Cabinet job in 2012 and is currently the chair of the Bundestag's Committee on Foreign Affairs, announced his intention to throw his hat into the ring earlier this month. DON'T MISS Merkel FURIOUS at Michel for forcing Germany to pay for Macron's budget demands [INSIGHT]EU DIVIDED: Merkel panic over Brexit black hole - Hard talks ahead' [VIDEO]Berlin admits to struggling economy blaming coronavirus and slump in trade [ANALYSIS]  In his Bundestag capacity, Mr RΓ¶ttgen penned a paper ahead of the Brexit referendum in 2016 urging the European Union and the United Kingdom to agree to a new ""continental partnership."" Under the proposal, Britain would have secured control of its borders while preserving the other key tenets of the EU project “ freedom of movement od capital, goods and services. But while the contest to succeed rages on, Chancellor Merkel only this week has had to contend with tense negotiations with her EU partners over the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) setting out rules for the common budget as well as a racially-motivated right-wing terrorist attack in the city of Hanau, near Frankfurt. And Mrs Merkel is also expected to see support for the CDU plummet yet again in Sunday's election in Hamburg.    Discussing latest voting intention polls released ahead of the vote, CNBC International reporter Annette Weisbach said: ""The record-low popularity for the CDU might actually pose a severe problem for the party itself. ""Normally, Hamburg is a stronghold of the Social-Democrats, the CDU never actually really won a vote there but they are still falling to record-lows in popularity."" But Ms Weisbach also pointed out the polls suggested the AfD, whose support base steadily increased in the past decade, could also suffer losses due to the terror attack in Hanau. She continued: ""The AfD is actually losing some momentum and those attacks in Hanau, very close to Frankfurt, are also not boding well for them. There's a clear understanding in German society that this should not be tolerated. ""Armin Laschet, one of the contenders for the chair of the CDU, was saying, the risks to society are clearly located on the right-wing side,' which is a very strong positioning for the politician."" The CNBC International reported added: ""For many years, the perception was that left-wing terror is a problem in Germany but now we're clearly looking at the right-end scene and that's not playing in the hands of the AfD.""

The latest cases appeared to bring the number of cases in Iran to 29 and the number of deaths to six. News of the latest cases and deaths came from Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur and the governor of Markazi province in central Iran, cited by state TV. The Health Ministry earlier on Saturday noted a total number of 28 cases and five deaths and the governor announced a death in Markazi province later in the day. Most of the cases, including eight of the new infections,  have been in Qom, a Shi'ite Muslim holy city 120 km (75 miles) south of the capital Tehran. Schools, universities and seminaries in Qom will be closed on Sunday and Monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the  virus, the government crisis management headquarters for Qom province announced on Saturday, according to the official IRNA news agency. Health officials had called on Thursday for the suspension of all religious gatherings in Qom. The cases in Iran have affected the neighbouring region. The United Arab Emirates announced two new coronavirus cases on Saturday, an Iranian tourist and his wife, the state news agency WAM reported, raising the total number of coronavirus cases in that country to 13. Lebanon confirmed its first coronavirus case on Friday, a 45-year-old woman returning from Qom. Iran has suspended religious pilgrimage trips to Iraq, an official who oversees pilgrimage trips said on Saturday, according to the Fars news agency. Iraq announced on Thursday that it had banned border crossings by Iranian nationals, Iraq's state news agency said. The decision came after Iraqi Airways suspended flights to Iran. Kuwait Airways also suspended all flights to Iran starting on Thursday. Saudi Arabia said on Friday it had suspended travel by citizens and expatriates to Iran. Kuwait Airways was operating special flights to evacuate more than 700 Kuwaitis from the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad on Saturday, it said in a post on its official Twitter account. WORRIES ABOUT COVER-UP The revelation by authorities of multiple coronavirus cases and deaths over a short period of time has led to criticism and accusations from Iranians online of a cover-up by officials. Some online posts have drawn comparisons between the handling of the recent coronavirus announcements and the way Iranian authorities revealed information about the crash of a passenger plane last month. Iran's Revolutionary Guards accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing all 176 aboard. Iranian authorities initially denied blame before later admitting the plane had been shot down in error. Iran's health minister, Saeed Namaki, made a reference to rumours about a cover-up on Saturday, saying any cases of coronavirus would be revealed to the public as soon as possible, according to the IRIB news agency. In a tweet on its Farsi language account, the U.S. State Department said the Iranian government was playing down the danger and giving people incorrect information. There was no immediate response from Iranian officials. The coronavirus began in China and has largely been focused there, but it has spread to a growing number of other countries.

Berkeley Lovelace Jr.@BerkeleyJrWilliam Feuer@WillFOIA,2/22/2020,cnbc,"New coronavirus cases in Iran, Italy fuel concerns disease cannot be contained",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/new-coronavirus-cases-in-iran-italy-fuel-concerns-disease-cannot-be-contained.html,"Localized outbreaks of the new coronavirus outside of China are fueling concerns among infectious disease experts and scientists that the virus is spreading too quickly and may be past the point of containment. Health officials are warning the public to prepare for a potential global pandemic. Iran health officials said Friday the COVID-19 coronavirus had spread to several cities, confirming 13 new cases and bringing its total in the country to 18 in just a matter of days. Hours later, Italy announced its outbreak had worsened, confirming 14 cases in the region of Lombardy and two cases in the adjacent region of Veneto. Outside of China, there are now 1,152 cases across 26 countries ” up from 505 cases across 24 countries a week ago ” and eight deaths as of Friday, according to the World Health Organization. The number of new cases was unprecedented just a month ago when there were as little as 300 COVID-19 cases worldwide, mainly in China. Experts are beginning to wonder: Is the genie out of the bottle? ""Over the last few weeks, many in the medical and public health communities wondered how much transmission is ongoing outside of China that we're just not aware of,"" Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the University of Toronto, said in a phone interview with CNBC. ""The concern is that there may be significant numbers of undetected and unreported cases in Iran. And that this may be another potential global focus for disease exportation,"" he said. Bogoch said the detection of the coronavirus in a Canadian woman who recently traveled to Iran was particularly concerning. ""There are possible arrows pointing in the direction that there may be an underappreciated burden of illness in Iran and if this person acquired infection in Iran and into Canada, it could be an indication that there are many, many more infections in Iran,"" he said. The outbreak looked like it was going in a different direction just a week ago. WHO officials said on Feb. 12 that the number of new cases in China appeared to have stabilized and that officials had ""a good view on the virus"" overall. Daily reports from Chinese health officials showed new cases in the country were declining. On Feb. 14, WHO reported 505 cases in two dozen countries outside of China but said there were no signs anywhere beyond China of community transmission, which is when officials cannot identify the source of the virus. Nearly all the cases outside of China were traced to people who had traveled through the epicenter of the outbreak. Only 107 cases were spread from one person to another outside of China, but many of those cases were people with a close relationship to a traveler who had carried the virus from China. China was taking drastic measures at that point to contain the virus, and WHO officials said new cases in China appeared to slow. Developments since then paint a bleaker picture. Cases outside of China have now doubled, to over 1,200, with more than 350 cases of transmission occurring outside of China. Cases in South Korea have spiked from 28 a week ago to 204 as of Friday, leading the southern city of Daegu, where many of the cases are centered, to ban mass gatherings and encourage self-quarantine. Iranian health officials confirmed this week that the virus had appeared in the country, infecting two patients, who died the same day their infections were confirmed. In just two days, Iranian health officials confirmed the virus had spread to 18 people in the country and warned of a possible wider spread. ""It's possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,"" health ministry official Minou Mohrez said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, said Friday that the sudden outbreak in Iran and other parts of the world is ""very worrisome."" He said there is still a chance for health officials to contain the virus, but it's getting less likely by the day. ""The window of opportunity is still there, but our window of opportunity is narrowing,"" Tedros said at a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva. ""We need to act quickly before it closes completely."" He also cautioned: ""This outbreak could still go in any direction."" Health officials are receiving information about the patients in Iran, but ""we have to engage them even more,"" Tedros said. Infectious disease experts say the virus may be entering a new phase with cases spreading outside of China. Yanzhong Huang, a public health researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University, said his biggest concern is whether countries such as Iran have the health-care infrastructure to detect and contain the virus. ""I'm not concerned about Japan or South Korea. I'm more concerned about Iran,"" he said. Dr. Jaouad Mahjour, assistant director of emergency preparedness at WHO, said Friday that Iran's health-care system has the ""basic capacity"" to detect and contain the coronavirus. Health officials said they remain concerned about the potential spread of the virus to countries with weaker health systems. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said he believes we're right about at the pandemic state. WHO ""will be slow to make that call, but it's kind of there whether they say it this week or next,"" he said. U.S. health officials said Friday that they are preparing for the coronavirus to become a pandemic. ""We're not seeing community spread here in the United States, yet, but it's very possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. ""Our goal continues to be slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread."" Messonnier pointed to China, where schools and businesses have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same. ""The day may come where we may need to implement such measures in this country,"" she said.",finance
By Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley,2/22/2020,nytimes,Digital Tax Fight Emerges as Global Economic Threat,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/digital-tax-economy-europe-united-states.html,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia ” The world's top economic leaders warned on Saturday that an international tax fight between the United States and Europe poses a new threat to the global economy if a resolution is not reached this year. After two years of economic fallout from a trade war between the United States and China, finance ministers and other senior officials at the Group of 20 meeting in Riyadh expressed alarm about an impasse over plans by foreign governments to impose new taxes on American technology companies. If a deal proves elusive in the coming months, European countries will begin collecting levies, which would probably set off retaliatory tariffs from the United States. The trade tensions of today would look like they are not so serious compared to the consequences of something like this, Angel GurrΓ­a, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said in an interview on the sidelines of the G20 on Saturday. There's the cacophony, the trade tensions that would invariably follow, and then there's the impact on growth. Several European countries, led by France, have been rolling out digital services taxes, which would hit American companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Italy, Spain, Austria and the United Kingdom have all announced plans for digital services taxes, which assess a levy based on the online activity that takes place in those countries, regardless of whether the company has a physical presence. The O.E.C.D. has been trying to head off a proliferation of disparate tax regimes around the world and has been leading negotiations over the last year for an international overhaul that would allow countries to tax certain digital service providers even if they lack physical operations inside their borders. Negotiators have set an end-of-year deadline to broker a deal that would set international standards for how, and where, online activity may be taxed. Also under discussion is whether to impose a global minimum tax of sorts on multinational corporations to discourage companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries like Ireland and Bermuda to minimize their tax bills. The United States, along with the tech industry, has been eager to prevent a proliferation of new digital taxes across the world and has pushed for a global tax regime that would govern all O.E.C.D. countries. But the talks hit a snag late last year when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the O.E.C.D. that the United States wanted American companies to essentially have the option to avoid some of the taxes. Some administration officials privately express concerns that the global minimum tax under discussion could discourage countries from further reducing their corporate tax rates, as the United States did in 2017. Lower rates, these officials argue, make their economies more attractive to global investment and help companies. Other economists say the competition to lower rates have encouraged firms to shift profits, at least on paper, to tax havens. The economic impact of the digital services taxes on the United States is relatively small, but American companies fear the levies could evolve to hit a broader swath of sectors beyond tech. A recent analysis by the O.E.C.D. found that the international tax changes under consideration would increase global corporate taxes by about $100 billion. The taxes have drawn the ire of President Trump, who has criticized Europe's attempt to collect more taxes from American companies. Last year, Mr. Trump said the United States would retaliate against France's digital tax by imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on French products such as wine, cheese and handbags. The United States agreed last month to delay those tariffs and France agreed to delay collection of the taxes in the hope that a more global agreement could be reached. European finance ministers expressed urgency on Saturday to reach an agreement, hoping to find common ground with the United States and avoid a broader economic conflict. Next year is coming very soon, said Olaf Scholz, Germany's finance minister. There is not time to wait for elections. But major obstacles remain and the strong opposition to any plan that would allow American companies to opt out of taxes was palpable. Clearly, there is a need to avoid any kind of optional solution, said Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister. I do not know of any private company that would choose to be taxed instead of not being taxed. Mr. Mnuchin tempered expectations that such a complicated deal could be reached so quickly. We are dealing with some of the most complicated international tax issues, Mr. Mnuchin said during a panel discussion at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. In the U.S., depending upon what the solutions are, these may require congressional approval. Mr. Mnuchin reaffirmed his view that he believed the European digital services taxes were discriminatory but said he was committed to the multilateral process underway so that companies could have clarity over taxes in an increasingly digital economy. The Treasury secretary also resisted the suggestion that the United States is proposing to make the tax optional, describing the proposal as a so-called safe harbor regime in which companies would agree to pay more in exchange for having more certainty over their tax bills. At a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin declined to elaborate on specifically how his safe harbor proposal would work and he suggested that there was too much focus on that point of contention. I would just encourage everybody to step back, Mr. Mnuchin said. These are complicated issues, there are ongoing discussions, there are big working groups and the objective is to work through this at the O.E.C.D. Even after meeting with Mr. Mnuchin over the weekend, Mr. Le Maire remained uncertain about the mechanism that the United States envisions to break the deadlock. In an interview, Mr. Le Maire said that he hoped that a compromise could be reached this year. Otherwise, he said, France would begin collecting the taxes. We won't have any other choice but to put our taxation back into place, he said. Failure to reach agreement on either the digital tax or the global minimum tax could scuttle the entire package. Finance ministers from other nations have made clear to Trump administration officials that a large swath of countries will not agree to any deal that allows some large American companies to effectively pick their preferred tax system to minimize their global liability. But the administration faces competing pressure at home, from businesses and lawmakers. Some multinational companies, including many tech giants, are eager for an agreement that would head off the complications of complying with different digital service taxes in a wide range of countries. Other companies fear the agreement would raise their taxes unexpectedly. Any deal might need to be ratified by the Senate, where approval would be difficult in any event, but more so if a large group of powerful corporations oppose it. Still, other countries have pressed the Trump administration to drop its so-called safe harbor demands and take a more active role in pushing negotiations toward consensus, starting with the finance ministers meeting this weekend. The tussle over international taxes comes as the global economy is emerging from a year of sluggish growth made worse by uncertainty from Mr. Trump's trade war with China and the disruption of global supply chains caused by American tariffs. While economists have projected a rebound this year, amid easing trade tension, the coronavirus outbreak in China represents a new variable that threatens to slow output. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said she currently thinks the virus could have a V-shaped impact on China's economy, causing a sharp drop in growth followed by a rapid recovery with modest spillover to the rest of the world. But she acknowledged that the trajectory of the virus was not clear. We recognize that other scenarios could be significantly more impactful, Ms. Georgieva said at a dinner in Riyadh sponsored by the Institute of International Finance. The I.M.F. on Saturday downgraded its forecast for China's economic growth this year by 0.4 percentage points to 5.6 percent and reduced its global growth outlook by 0.1 percentage points to 3.2 percent. Tax experts who have been tracking the talks fear the chances of reaching a sweeping agreement by the end of the year are slim given the complex internal politics involved in brokering a deal with so many countries. The O.E.C.D. process is hanging by a thread and the consequences of failure are underappreciated by European sovereigns, said Itai Grinberg, an international tax policy professor at Georgetown University Law Center. If the talks do fail and European countries move ahead with their digital taxes, Mr. Grinberg said, the response from the United States would be forceful, particularly if Mr. Trump is re-elected in November. There is a high risk that the O.E.C.D. process is going to crater and that is what is driving the building bipartisan willingness to consider what the retaliatory measures by the United States would be, he said. Mr. Mnuchin did offer one option to avert such a fate on Saturday. If everybody adopts the U.S. proposal, I have 100 percent confidence we'll get it done, Mr. Mnuchin said, eliciting some laughter from his counterparts.

By Amy Harmon and Farah Stockman,2/22/2020,nytimes,All Hands on Deck': Health Workers Race to Track Thousands of Americans Amid Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/coronavirus-local-health-response.html,"After a long journey at sea on the Westerdam cruise ship, which was denied entry at ports across Asia over fears of the coronavirus, Holley Rauen finally returned home to Florida on Wednesday night. Moments later, she discovered that she had joined a cast of thousands who are being meticulously tracked by local health officials across the United States. As Ms. Rauen's plane from overseas touched down, one message was already waiting on her phone, from a nurse at the local public health department in her Florida county. Should she develop a fever or cough over the next 14 days, she should report it immediately, the nurse explained when Ms. Rauen called back. I was so impressed, said Ms. Rauen, who is herself a retired public health nurse from the same health department in Lee County. We are really truly in uncharted waters. Preventing the spread of infectious disease is the essence of public health work, but the scale of efforts by state and local health departments across the country to contain the virus known as COVID-19, experts said, has rarely been seen. Since early February, thousands of people returning to the United States from mainland China, the center of the outbreak, have been asked to isolate themselves at home for 14 days. transcript Voices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare. People who are willing to speak out about the government's attempts to control news about the deadly coronavirus. They asked to remain anonymous, because what they're doing could put them and their families at great risk. But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens, fighting to get the message out in a country that aggressively censors information. Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech are quickly scrubbed from the internet. Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about life under lockdown. [clanging] Posted online one day, but gone the next. But the crisis over the coronavirus is changing the landscape, for now at least. Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting information the government doesn't want out there. Experts say this kind of digital resistance is happening at a scale they've never seen before. Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China. But internet savvy people use techniques that allow them to repost censored content to these platforms, while staying under the radar of authorities. They're creating a visual archive by preserving videos like this one, showing overwhelmed hospitals. [screaming] And they're reposting people's personal stories. Some are also turning to less obvious platforms, including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders. Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on? They're making open and widespread calls for freedom of speech. These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus, and was punished by officials for speaking out. He died in early February from the coronavirus. Right after his death, the hashtag I want freedom of speech started to trend on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. Then, it was quickly censored by the government. Dr. Li's become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who's winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance. Local health officials check in daily by email, phone or text. They arrange tests for people who come down with symptoms, and in some cases, groceries and isolated housing. There is no centralized tally in the United States of people being monitored or asked to remain in isolation, and they are scattered across the nation's nearly 3,000 local health jurisdictions. People arriving from mainland China are added each day, while those who have completed 14-day self-quarantine periods are released from oversight. In California alone, the department of public health has been monitoring more than 6,700 returning travelers from China, while health officials in Washington State have tracked about 800, and officials in Illinois more than 200. The nationwide mobilization is taking a financial toll, health officials say. The cost to local health departments is unknown, but some experts say it has reached into the tens of millions. Even as the first of 34 confirmed coronavirus patients in the United States have recovered in recent days, health officials say they are preparing for what some fear could still be a much wider outbreak. Worldwide, the virus, which is known to be highly contagious, has infected 75,000 people and killed more than 2,000. All hands on deck are being pulled into this,'' said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, a nonprofit organization that represents public health agencies across the country. If it really blows up, at some point, it could overwhelm state and local health departments. So far, officials say, the containment effort in this country has been largely orderly. The only known transmission of the virus in the United States has involved people in the same household. But no matter how effective health workers are in monitoring their charges, there will always be some leakage,'' said Dr. John Wiesman, the Secretary of Health in Washington State. In Washington, where the first coronavirus patient in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21, health officials tracked down and monitored 69 individuals with whom the man had come in contact, including work colleagues, health workers and other patients present in a clinic he visited when he first felt sick. Still, there have been issues. One person the man had been in contact with and who had developed symptoms of illness flew on a plane to Wisconsin during the 14-day period when she was supposed to be isolated at home. There is no way, with something this large, that you can make it seal-proof,'' said Dr. Wiesman, who has started twice-weekly conference calls with the chief health officers in every state and territory to share tips and seek advice on how to manage the shifting challenges of the coronavirus response. While enforcing total compliance with isolation orders may not be possible, Dr. Wiesman said, We have to try for 80 to 85 percent, and hopefully that will work.'' Federal authorities are in charge of setting guidelines to manage the danger, such as deciding how much risk a returning traveler poses and who should be tested for the coronavirus. But the day-to-day work putting those policies in place and tracking thousands of people falls to the vast, decentralized network of local health departments across the country. Travelers' data, culled from federal customs officials, is passed on to state health agencies, who farm out lists of people returning from China to local health departments. In the Chicago area, public health officials are using an electronic monitoring system originally developed to track the measles to monitor more than 200 travelers. Each day, they receive a link asking their temperature and symptoms. The costs associated with containing the virus have reached more than $150,000 a week for the Chicago public health department alone, according to its commissioner, Dr. Allison Arwady. Among the costs: $17,000 for a quarantine facility at an undisclosed location for people who can't isolate themselves at home. So far, fewer than five people have used it, she said. If you are quarantining them under a legal order, you have to think about food, their medications, their communication needs and their mental health, she said. Some jurisdictions have negotiated with hotels to host people who may harbor the virus. Washington State has RV's. Ruth Jones, public health commissioner in Quincy, Mass., a town of about 100,000 people south of Boston, says that her department has been receiving lists of between three and 10 people each day who are returning from China and are being asked to stay isolated from other people. Quincy's two public health nurses and two translators have been working long hours to call them and make sure they understand how to monitor and report any symptoms. It's overtime for our nurses,'' Ms. Jones said. It's been extremely busy, Local officials in places that have had confirmed cases have been under particular strain. In Madison and Dane County, Wis., a local health staff of 160 has been forced to rearrange its operation to focus on monitoring anyone who may have been exposed to a resident who tested positive for the virus after falling ill and remains in self-isolation. Updated June 22, 2020 A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort and requires balancing benefits versus possible adverse events. Masks do alter exercise, says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. In my personal experience, he says, heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask. Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico. The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don't typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country's largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave. So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was very rare,  but she later walked back that statement. Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus ” whether it's surface transmission or close human contact ” is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation's job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren't being told to stay at home, it's still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. We're in this new normal, but it's not normal, said Janel Heinrich, the county's director of public health. Along with monitoring individuals who are seen as at risk of having been exposed to the virus, state and local health officials have been scrambling to prepare for worst case scenarios in the months ahead. State officials in Washington said they will hold a webinar next week to brief school superintendents on best practices for cleaning and planning for home schooling should schools need to shut down. People are doing contingency planning,'' said Julie Sullivan-Springhetti, spokeswoman for the Multnomah County Health Department in Oregon, which has devoted resources to preparing a regional hospital system for a potential case. Just like we plan for the Cascadia earthquake, which may or may not happen in our lifetime. As for the returning passengers from the Westerdam, the cruise ship, passengers at first thought they had no reason to worry about the coronavirus because no one on the ship had traveled through mainland China during the outbreak. But after passengers began leaving the ship to head home, an 83-year-old woman was reported to have tested positive on a layover in Malaysia, creating confusion and chaos. Erin Carney, 70, a retired nurse and midwife from Mendocino County, Calif., flew out on the same flight as the woman who was reported to have tested positive, though questions have been raised about that finding and the C.D.C. has since said that other passengers do not need to isolate themselves. Given the initial reports of a positive test, Ms. Carney called hospitals to figure out what she and her partner should do. The person that we spoke to read the C.D.C. guidelines and thought that everything seemed fine and we didn't have to self-quarantine, Ms. Carney said. They said, If you have symptoms, go see your doctor.' But then a nurse from the Mendocino County Health and Human Services Department called Ms. Carney. She recommended that they quarantine themselves at home, and offered to supply groceries. We had kind of talked about doing that anyway, Ms. Carney said. They've called every day since. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.",business
By Motoko Rich,2/22/2020,nytimes,We're in a Petri Dish': How a Coronavirus Ravaged a Cruise Ship,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html,"YOKOHAMA, Japan ” The captain came over the intercom early in the evening: A passenger who had left the ship nine days earlier had tested positive for the new coronavirus sweeping through China. While the guests on board were unnerved, it was the final night of their two-week luxury cruise aboard the Diamond Princess. The revelry continued as the ship headed toward the port in Yokohama, Japan's second-largest city. Passengers dined on filet mignon, attended shows in the 700-seat theater and crowded the bars and dance floors into the night. Cruise directors hastily distributed a slate of activities, including Ping-Pong, karaoke and Bollywood dance lessons, to occupy guests who would have to remain on the ship another day while public health officials screened them for symptoms. Hoping to soak up the final hours of their romantic voyage, Tyler and Rachel Torres, newlyweds from Irving, Texas, took in a performance by a torch singer that evening. We didn't really consider the danger of leaving the room, said Ms. Torres, 24, an occupational therapist. And since we were on our honeymoon, we refused to waste our last moments on the cruise. As the music played on, passengers were potentially exposed to the virus. In all, it took Japanese officials more than 72 hours to impose a lockdown after they were first notified about the case connected to the ship. The delay by the Japanese government, along with slapdash and ineffective containment measures during the two-week isolation period, would help turn the Diamond Princess into a floating epidemiological disaster. A retiree from California had a fever on the first day of the quarantine but was not tested for the virus. A day after the quarantine began, hundreds of passengers continued regular cruise activities and ate together at large buffets.

Many were infected. 4 Feverish passengers were left in their rooms for days without being tested for the virus. Health officials and even some medical professionals worked on board without full protective gear. Sick crew members slept in cabins with roommates who continued their duties across the ship, undercutting the quarantine. With 634 infections and two deaths, the cruise ship represents the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China, meriting its own category in the data compiled by the World Health Organization. The U.S. government this past week allowed 14 Americans who were infected to board evacuation flights with hundreds of passengers who weren't. Japanese officials have since let close to 1,000 passengers who tested negative walk free, even though experts fear some of them have been exposed and could later develop symptoms. Crew members were expected to start leaving this weekend. On Saturday, the health minister admitted that 23 passengers had been released from the ship without taking a valid recent test and had traveled by public transit after disembarking this past week. Now that the quarantine has ended and most of the passengers have left, the concern is that they could start spreading the virus on shore. Japanese officials said they did the best they could in a fast-moving situation, as they tried to keep the virus from spreading within the country. After confirming the first cases among those on board, the authorities said, they moved to isolate passengers to reduce transmission. The government has said the quarantine was largely effective. The ship operator, Princess Cruises, said Japanese authorities took the lead in testing and protocols. It added that the focus has been and remains the safety, health and well-being of our guests and crew. In the early hours of Feb. 2, before the ship had even docked in Yokohama, Hong Kong officials informed the Japanese health ministry about the initial infected passenger. Recreational area Nightclub Bar Pool and Fitness Center Recreational area Pool and Fitness Center Bar Nightclub Recreational area Pool and Fitness Center Bar Nightclub A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company received formal verification of the infection from Hong Kong on Feb. 3, and announced it to passengers on the ship that evening. Only as the parties and shows ended around 11 that night were guests advised to stick to their rooms. After the boat docked in Yokohama, medical officers boarded the ship and went door to door taking temperatures, checking for coughs and testing some passengers for the virus. The cruise directors scratched the planned activities the next day, while the screening continued. People still mingled on board, lining up at large buffets for meals. They used communal ladles and tongs, and shared salt and pepper shakers on tables. Promenade deck with lounges, bars and shops Promenade deck with lounges, bars and shops Passengers figured their departure would be delayed by only a day or so. Many were walking up to breakfast when the captain came over the intercom again on the morning of Feb. 5. The Japanese health ministry had now confirmed 10 cases of the coronavirus on the ship, he told them. Guests needed to return to their rooms immediately, where they would have to stay, isolated, for the next 14 days. Trapped in their cabins, the 2,666 passengers now had time to recall every encounter that might have exposed them to the virus in the days before the ship's lockdown. DECK 14 Passenger cabins DECK 14 Passenger cabins There was the buffet on Deck 14, where guests were urged to wash their hands before joining the line, though hygiene habits varied widely, some passengers recalled. Now they wondered why the buffet had remained open even after the ship's officers learned about the infected guest. Memories of art auctions, afternoon high teas, quiz nights and mahjong games all took on a sinister hue. Everything looks tainted in retrospect, said Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif., who left on an American evacuation flight. A Princess spokeswoman said that the crew had carried out routine environmental cleaning and sanitizing using disinfectant that is known to quickly kill coronaviruses in 30 seconds. Passengers worried about their excursions on shore. The infected passenger had taken a bus tour in Kagoshima, a city in southern Japan. Gay Courter, 75, an American novelist from Crystal River, Fla., who once set a murder mystery on a cruise, dwelled on the ship's last stop, in Naha, the capital of Okinawa. As people disembarked, public health officials took their temperatures ” a measure that was becoming more commonplace as the virus spiraled in China. Looking back, Ms. Courter wondered if the coronavirus had already started to spread. With her husband, Philip, and a group of friends, she ate noodles and fried sweet potatoes at an outdoor stall. In my heart, I regret doing that, she said, because it was such a crowded place and there were people from the ship crawling around the town. Each day, more cases emerged: 10, another 10, then a spike of 41. What distressed passengers most was a sense that information was being withheld. Hours would pass between when the health ministry leaked new cases to the media and the people on board were notified. Passengers took to counting ambulances lined up on the pier to guess how many new infections would be announced that day. Japanese guests hung banners off balconies, with one reading, Serious lack of medicine, lack of information. Policies and protocols shifted as the quarantine wore on. On the second day, health officials began letting those in windowless cabins out for fresh air breaks. It wasn't until the next day that passengers were warned to keep more than six feet away from anyone else. Mr. Torres, a nurse who has since evacuated with his wife, noticed that others were not always vigilant about wearing masks on deck. On the fifth day, passengers were issued heavy-duty N95 masks and advised to wear them when they opened their doors to accept deliveries of meals and amenities from the crew. Halfway into the quarantine, the Japanese government announced that some people would be eligible to continue their confinement onshore ” those 80 or older with underlying medical conditions or windowless cabins. The changes didn't inspire confidence. Passengers were waiting days for prescriptions to be filled for chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. People were running out of toothpaste and clean underwear. Tadashi Chida, a passenger in his 70s, sent a handwritten letter to Japan's health ministry complaining that the crew seemed overwhelmed and that quarantine officers were not attending to those with symptoms. The ship is out of control, Mr. Chida said, adding that his wife had waited nearly a week for medication. An outbreak is happening, he said. We have no road maps. Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said this past week that the country's authorities had made the maximum consideration to secure the health of passengers and crew. At first, health officials didn't test everyone, saying they lacked the resources. Instead, they focused on high-risk individuals: those who had direct contact with the infected passenger, and later older and symptomatic people. Some passengers had trouble getting medical attention, even when they started to show possible symptoms. On the first full day of the quarantine, Carol Montgomery, 67, a retired administrative assistant from San Clemente, Calif., called the infirmary, saying she had a fever and wanted to be tested. She was told that it was up to the Japanese health ministry, and that no tests were available on board. After a day passed, her husband, John, called the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and tried to convince an official that everybody needed to be tested. We're in a petri dish, Mr. Montgomery said. It's an experiment. We're their guinea pigs. Ms. Montgomery eventually persuaded the ship's medical office to let the couple leave their cabin for an exam. A doctor gave them flu tests, which came back negative. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic for Ms. Montgomery's urinary tract infection. They still did not get tested for the coronavirus. The couple later evacuated with the Americans. John Haering, a retired railway operations manager from Tooele, Utah, called the medical office when his temperature rose sharply. He was told that if it wasn't an emergency, he would have to wait. At one point, someone came to the door with a clipboard, he said, asked for his temperature and left. Inside the cabin he shared with his wife, Mr. Haering, 63, sweated it out, taking cold showers and swallowing the last of their Tylenol supply as his temperature climbed to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Four days later, after his fever had broken, officials in hazmat suits showed up at the couple's door, ordered Mr. Haering to pack a bag, and loaded him into an ambulance, leaving his wife on the ship. The next day, a doctor at a hospital about 40 miles from the port told him he had tested positive for the virus. He remains in the hospital, while his wife, Melanie, is now in quarantine on a U.S. military base. Through it all, crew members were working overtime, sometimes as long as 13-hour shifts. They prepared and delivered meals three times a day to 1,500 staterooms. They dropped off towels, bedsheets and extra treats for guests: Sudoku puzzles, origami papers, beauty masks and, on Valentine's Day, chocolates. The crew members, who numbered 1,045, had to remain on the job even as they faced the greatest risk of infection. All told, 85 crew members have tested positive for the virus.

But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. When you haven't been exercising, you lose muscle mass. Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren't being told to stay at home, it's still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for.

If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. Below deck, they shared close quarters, with as many as four to a bathroom. They ate their own meals buffet-style. Most crew members stayed on decks 2 and 3. Most crew members stayed on decks 2 and 3. They manned phone lines as frantic guests called looking for answers to endless questions. They swabbed the decks and guardrails after each fresh air break for passengers. They did guests' laundry. For certain tasks, they did not wear gloves, and they reused face masks for more than the recommended day. There were also new duties: guarding the hallways at night to ensure that passengers didn't leave their rooms. When infected passengers were sent to hospitals, crew members had to carry their luggage. The emotional, psychological and physical stress that we are going through now is really hard, said a woman who worked in the kitchens, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job. She has since tested positive for the virus. Even after some crew members came down with a fever, they continued to share rooms with other workers. My cabin mate is staying with me, said one person on the housekeeping staff who was consigned to his room when he developed a fever. But he is working. What's the point of isolation? he asked. We are stuck in a box which is already contaminated. The virus has also ravaged public health officials who knew they were walking onto a contaminated ship. Hundreds of these officials, many of them bureaucrats with little experience in managing infectious diseases, helped with screenings and administrative tasks. Some did not wear full protective gear, and six contracted the virus. Health ministry officials reluctantly allowed Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist, onto the ship late in the quarantine. Dr. Iwata was alarmed by the lack of control measures, even among the medical staff. In videos he posted on YouTube, he said he had observed a nurse at the ship's medical center receiving ill crew members without wearing a mask. She said she was already infected, and so she was completely giving up, he said in the videos. He took down his YouTube posts after coming under criticism for violating the chain of command on the ship. To pass the time in captivity, passengers spent long hours streaming movies or posting on social media. They did calisthenics and watched the onboard magician perform tricks on closed-circuit television. As the infections continued to mount, boredom turned to fear. On private Facebook groups, passengers said they were desperate to leave, with their families using the hashtag #getthemoffthatboat. They questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine, fretting that the virus could pass between rooms through the ventilation system. After American passengers raised concerns with the embassy, an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote that there was no current evidence to suggest that the virus spreads between rooms on a ship through the air-handling system. The best course, the official said, was for passengers to wait out the quarantine in their rooms. A week and a half later, American officials reversed their position. The U.S. government announced that it was evacuating them before the end of the quarantine and would confine them for an additional 14 days on bases in California and Texas. A letter to American passengers said that the Department of Health and Human Services made an assessment that passengers and crew members onboard are at high risk of exposure. The evacuation turned problematic. While the 328 passengers and crew members were on their way to the airport in Tokyo, American officials learned from Japanese health authorities that 14 of them had tested positive for the coronavirus. They waited for hours on the tarmac as C.D.C. experts debated with officials from the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services about what to do. It took so long that some passengers had to get off and urinate against the side of the buses. Officials from the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services ultimately decided to take them all. They put the infected at the back, separating them on two planes with only 10-foot plastic sheeting and tape. As the passengers boarded, Ms. Courter was standing next to a woman as she was being told she had tested positive. We were less than three feet away, Ms. Courter said. And I remember thinking, I just spent two weeks to avoid anyone who is positive, and now here is one breathing right in front of me.' Other countries followed the lead of the United States in organizing charter flights for their citizens and new 14-day quarantines. Still, that left many to just walk off the ship at the end of the quarantine in Yokohama, including a large number of Japanese passengers, who made up half of those on board. The night of Feb. 18, the health ministry began clearing passengers to leave, giving all certificates saying they had tested negative for the coronavirus and posed no risk of infection. Nearly 1,000 walked free over the next three days, some boarding city buses, others climbing into taxis. Experts have questioned whether those passengers truly pose no risk to the general public. Some could develop symptoms later after having tested negative. Just two days after leaving the ship on Wednesday with a negative test result, a woman in her 60s developed a fever and tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday. The day after news emerged that the 14 passengers who had tested positive were being flown to the United States, President Trump was furious, said two American officials. The decision to fly them into the country had taken him by surprise. On Thursday, Linda Tsukamoto, 63, a retired retail manager from Marina del Rey, Calif., who decided not to take one of the American flights, was released from the ship. She will not be allowed back into the United States for at least another two weeks, so she checked into a hotel in Tokyo. She said that hotel staff members were wearing masks, and that there were signs warning guests of the risk of the coronavirus. I will stay in most of the time, she said, to stay safe after this long journey. Reporting was contributed by Eimi Yamamitsu, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo; Ben Dooley and Edward Wong from Washington; and Elaine Yu from Hong Kong.",business

All times below are in Beijing time. South Korean health officials confirmed another 87 cases, bringing the country's total to 433. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 62 of the 87 new cases stem from the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu. It also said three of the 87 new cases stemmed from another large cluster tied to the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital. ”Wang The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said that 277 of its 346 confirmed cases stem from two clusters ” a church and a hospital. Nearly half of South Korea's confirmed cases stem from the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu. KCDC said the timing of symptom development ""suggests the possibility of a limited but continuous transmission through Sunday services or gatherings every week."" The 108 cases stemming from the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital cluster are primarily from the psychiatric ward, KCDC said. The agency also said South Korea's second death was a woman who was a long-term patient at the hospital. ”Wang Malaysia's Ministry of Health said in a statement that an 83-year-old U.S. citizen has now tested negative for the new coronavirus twice. It said that the woman's condition has remarkably improved, but that she's still being monitored for a small cough. The ministry said it tests people confirmed with the disease twice within 24 hours if they have displayed good progress in symptoms, in an attempt to determine if the person has been cured. A week ago, the woman had been identified as the 22nd case in Malaysia after she arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Sihanoukville, Cambodia. She had been a passenger on the MS Westerdam cruise ship, which had been turned away by five countries amid coronavirus fears. ”Wang Chinese state media reported that seven ships brought into the city of Wuhan in Hubei province will be converted into temporary accommodations for medical staff in the city. Thousands of medical workers from across the country have been brought into Hubei to help the province contain the outbreak. Xinhua News reported that the ships normally operate as river cruises in the Three Gorges, a popular and scenic tourist area along the Yangtze River. The state news agency said, however, that the cruise ship business in the Three Gorges had been closed due to the outbreak. The move comes amid heightened scrutiny after hundreds of passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship contracted the new coronavirus. ”Wang Four South Korean soldiers have been infected with the new coronavirus, a military official told NBC News. The official said the military has suspended outdoor training and will instead conduct training indoors until further notice. He also told NBC that all holiday breaks and visitors have been suspended for soldiers in an effort to limit their contacts outside military facilities. Earlier, South Korea reported a sharp uptick in confirmed cases. (See 9:09 a.m. update) ”Wang The Australian government said high school students in their final two years of study can apply for exemptions from the country's coronavirus travel restrictions. It said, however, these exemptions will be made on a ""case-by-case basis does not apply to anyone from Hubei province."" Australia said these exemptions will be made in recognition of ""strict school attendance requirements under state and territory regulations, which if not met would prevent [the students] from completing their senior secondary qualifications."" The government said there are about 760 students already enrolled in Australian schools who have not been able to enter the country because of the coronavirus travel restrictions. Students who are granted exemptions would still be subject to the enhanced border screening measures for Australian citizens and residents returning from China. The government noted, however, that violating quarantine arrangements after returning to Australia could make their visas subject to cancellation. ”Wang Reuters reported, citing comments Vice Governor Liu Quoqiang made to the Financial News, that the People's Bank of China will keep supporting the economy through measures releasing more liquidity to help companies impacted by the outbreak. The news agency reported, however, that Liu said the central bank will not resort to ""flood-like"" stimulus. ”Wang Organizers for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics have postponed volunteer training that was scheduled to begin Saturday, citing efforts to limit the spread of the new coronavirus COVID-19. In an online statement, organizers said the training sessions will be postponed until May or later. ”Wang The Hong Kong government said its second flight returning residents from the Diamond Princess cruise ship arrived early Saturday. It said the flight included 82 Hong Kong residents and two Macao residents. The people will be transferred to a quarantine center where they will be under observation for 14 days, the city said. As of Friday, the government said 66 of the 634 confirmed coronavirus cases stemming from the cruise ship were Hong Kong residents. Those people are receiving treatment in Japan, Hong Kong said. ”Wang China's National Health Commission reported an additional 109 deaths, almost all in Hubei province. That brings the country's death toll to 2,345 people, according to government data. As of the end of Friday, the new coronavirus has infected another 397 people with China's total confirmed cases at 76,288, the commission said. China also revised its figures for Wednesday and Thursday. For Feb. 19, it said newly confirmed cases were revised from 394 up to 820. As of Feb. 20, the commission said there were 75,891 cumulative confirmed cases, up from 75,465. ”Christine Wang and Evelyn Cheng South Korea confirmed another 142 news cases as of Feb. 22, 9:00 a.m. local time, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That brings the total number of cases in the country to 346, making it the largest number of infections outside China. The agency also said that another person has died, bringing the death toll in South Korea to two. ”Joanna Tan Correction: This entry was updated to reflect that two people have died from the new coronavirus in South Korea. All times below are in Eastern time. Thousands of DuPont employees are working around the clock to increase production of protective garments that are in high demand by first responders and medical workers in high-impact regions like Wuhan, China. The protective suits are used by health professionals during the outbreaks to reduce the risk of infection. Reports from China show workers running low on safety supplies including garments and masks. ”Mody and Manning Online travel booking company Trip.com is pushing back its fourth-quarter earnings report from Feb. 26 to March 18 to tally the impact of the outbreak on its ticketing and tour business, the company said.

Claire Anderson,2/22/2020,express,Coronavirus warning: Diabetes sufferers at severe risk' as everyone can catch deadly flu,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1245968/coronavirus-news-symptoms-death-toll-diabetes-high-blood-pressure-health-latest-update," Coronavirus has killed 2,366 across the world and infected 77,976 people since the December outbreak in Wuhan, China. While the World Health Organisation desperately develops a vaccine, virologist expert Dr Mike Skinner has explained anyone can catch the disease but will have different experiences with it. Speaking to Express.co.uk, Dr Skinner said: In terms of getting infected the attack rate looks quite high. I think almost all of us, if not, a large proportion of us are likely to be infected. But a relatively small proportion would be severely affected if they have bad symptoms and might need clinical support. A very small proportion will be at severe risk and could potentially die. READ MORE: Italy orders schools to close as coronavirus spreads   The people who know better than me say it's less likely to be respiratory conditions than predisposes them to more severe outcomes which was the case with H1N1. It seems to be more diabetes and high blood pressure that seem to be some of the predisposing factors coming forward. It comes as Britons evacuated from a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship are preparing to spend more time in quarantine after landing back in the UK. The passengers, who were trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan for more than two weeks, will be isolated for a further 14 days at a facility on Merseyside.  A repatriation flight carrying 32 British and European evacuees from the vessel touched down at Ministry of Defence base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire shortly after 11.30am on Saturday. Masked passengers are being bussed to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral for 14 days of quarantine to protect against the spread of the illness should any of them be infected. The group, who tested negative to having Covid-19 before they flew, are expected to arrive at the hospital later on Saturday afternoon. As with the previous coachloads brought to Arrowe Park, the bus drivers did not appear to be wearing any protective clothing as the convoy, escorted by police and ambulance vehicles, was pictured leaving the MoD base.

Clive McKeef,2/22/2020,marketwatch,"IMF lowers global economic growth forecast, warns of more dire scenarios'",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/imf-lowers-global-economic-growth-forecast-warns-of-more-dire-scenarios-2020-02-22?mod=article_inline,"China's coronavirus epidemic will likely cut 0.1% from global economic growth, and drag down growth for China's economy to 5.6% this year, the International Monetary Fund said on Saturday. But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Finance ministers and central bankers of the world's 20 biggest economies (G20) are discussing top global economic challenges on Saturday and Sunday in Riyadh, focusing on the growth outlook and new rules to tax global digital companies. In January the IMF had forecast  global growth to strengthen from 2.9 percent last year to 3.3 percent this year. Since then, COVID-19 which the World Health Organization deemed a global health emergency, has disrupted activity in China. The Chinese authorities are working to mitigate the negative impact on the economy, with crisis measures, liquidity provision, fiscal measures, and financial support, Georgieva noted. In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China's economy would return to normal in the second quarter. As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived, she said. In this scenario, 2020 growth for China would be 5.6 percent. This is 0.4 percentage points lower than the January WEO Update. Global growth would be about 0.1 percentage points lower. The fallout of the coronavirus epidemic is growing, given Chinese factories are still operating around half their capacity and many workers remain housebound. The partial shutdown of the world's second biggest economy is having an effect elsewhere by weakening trade, fraying manufacturing supply chains, reducing tourism and fanning investor uncertainty. The world economy is facing a clear slowdown and this slowdown might be reinforced by the so-called coronavirus, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in Riyadh. The question remains open whether it will be a V-shape with a quick recovery of the world economy, or whether it would lead to an L-shape with a persistent slowdown in world growth. He said the V-shaped scenario was more likely. The G20 expects a modest pick-up in global growth this year and next, but noted downside risks to this outlook stemming from ... geopolitical and remaining trade tensions and policy uncertainty and macroeconomic risk related to environmental sustainability.

Four Britons who tested positive for the deadly virus are being treated in Japanese hospitals.

It comes after passengers were trapped on the coronavirus-hit cruise liner in the port of Yokohama for two weeks. A total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected with the killer bug, accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China.

However, they have now told their son of their anguish at being kept in conditions similar to a ""prison"". After speaking with his parents, Stephen said: ""We tracked them down to the other hospital and they are both in a really bad way. They are distressed. ""His exact words to me were 'we can't take any more of this, it's like a prison. 'We don't have shower facilities or a bathroom, we have a small room with a little toilet'."" 1.20pm update: Diamond Princess passengers on their way up north Those who landed at Ministry of Defence base Boscombe Down in Wiltshire earlier today are now making their way up the motorway to Arrowe Park hospital on Wirral. The passengers must spend two weeks in quarantine before they can return home. The journey to Arrowe Park hospital is expected to take approximately four hours.   12.45pm update: Fear virus will spread to Africa The World Health Organisation has been concerned since the start of the Coronavirus crisis that countries with less advanced health services could be vulnerable. Now, the international body has announced it is shipping protective equipment to countries in Africa to help them prepare for a potential outbreak. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: We've also shipped more than 30,000 sets of personal protective equipment to six countries in Africa, and we're ready to ship almost 60,000 more sets to 19 countries in the coming weeks We're working with manufacturers of personal protective equipment (PPE) to address the severe disruption in the market for masks, gloves, gowns and other PPE, to ensure we can protect health workers. 12.10pm update: Foreign Office praised for their work in bringing home cruise passengers Staff at the civil service have been praised by Foreign Secretary following the Diamond Princess evacuation flight's landing. Dominic Raab MP said in a statement: ""We have brought 32 British and European citizens safely home from Japan. The FCO worked hard to get them back to the UK securely. ""Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals."" His congratulations for the ""hard work"" of the civil service comes after some passengers onboard the cruise angrily accused the Government of not doing enough to bring them back to the UK sooner. 11.30am update: Diamond Princess evacuation flight lands in UK The flight to rescue Britons stranded on the coronavirus-ridden Diamond Princess cruise ship has finally landed in the UK. Carrying 32 UK nationals as well as European citizens, the flight touched down just after 11.30am. Those on board will now face two weeks in quarantine before they can return to regular life. Upon their arrival in the UK those on board the evacuation flight were greeted by nine coaches who will transport them to Arrowe Park on Wirral where they will remain in isolation. A fleet of ambulances were also on standby.   10.55am update: Coronavirus outbreak causes global economic slowdown with China at standstill' The global economy has been badly hit by the outbreak of coronavirus, with growth slowing according to a leading economist. China is thought to be at a standstill and the rest of Asia has also been accused of bearing the brunt of the economic consequences of the virus. Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Dr Gerald Lyons, Chief Economist at Natwealth, said: The world economy is slowing. At the beginning of the year, China and the rest of Asia looked likely to account for two-thirds of global growth this year. Now China is at a standstill and because of supply chains the rest of Asia including Japan have slowed sharply. That inevitably means the world economy is already slowing and depending on how long that lasts it will slow further.  10.20am update: China getting virus under control - but world still at risk China has today reported a sharp decrease in the number of deaths and new cases of coronavirus. The country which saw the outbreak of the deadly virus has taken extreme meaures to try and contain the spread of Covid-19, including placing large cities on lockdown.

Live reporting taken over by Dan Falvey from James Bickerton 5.43am update: US authorites confirm 35 coronavirus cases US authorities have confirmed they are dealing with 35 coronavirus patients. Of these 21 cases involved repatriated patients whilst the rest originated in the US. On Friday Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, commented: ""We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time."" 4.15am update: China announces 118 more deaths Chinese authorities have announced the deaths of 118 more people over the past 24 hours from coronavirus.

However, Mr Steele was later removed from the ship and taken ashore to a Japanese hospital two weeks ago, after testing positive for the virus. He was forced to leave his wife, unaffected, onboard, but after both testing negative for the virus recently, the couple was reunited this week. They will be spending the next two weeks at Arrowe Park hospital, with Mr Steele joking it would be like another holiday. He wrote on Facebook: ""Wendy's test was negative so Butlins the Wirral here we come for 14 days."" 9.20am update: Hong Kong citizens set up face mask factory A group of citizens from Hong Kong have set up a face mask factory in response to panic buying in the midst of the coronavirus. The leader of the group goes only by the name of Tang, out of fear he could be perceived as critical of the response of the Chinese government. He said: ""I got angry looking for masks, they're either all sold out, or the masks that are from overseas are sold at an inflated price. ""So I thought, making a mask isn't that hard, just some fabric sewn together, how about I make my own factory?"" Tang, and those who have offered him financial support, imported in a machine from India - costing them $150,000 for the privilege. The machine makes 100,000 masks a day and Tang hopes to have eight machines running by April. They are to be sold for HK$1 each, as opposed to some sellers who are charging HK$10, although some pharmacists are handing out masks for free.

Daniel Blackham,2/22/2020,express,Inter Milan vs Sampdoria postponed as Serie A take action following coronavirus deaths,https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1246077/Inter-Milan-Sampdoria-postponed-Serie-A-Coronavirus," Inter Milan's game against Sampdoria is one of three Serie A matches to be postponed due to fears over the coronavirus following two deaths in the country. The Prime Minister of Italy confirmed that Atlanta vs Sassuolo and Verona vs Cagliari will also not be played. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte made the call to postpone three top flight games over fears relating to the coronavirus outbreak. Several lower league games were postponed ahead of the weekend after a woman in Lombardy became the second Italian to die this week. Inter were looking to keep pace with Serie A leaders Juventus, who played on Saturday. Cristiano Ronaldo and Aaron Ramsey scored to give Juve a 2-1 lead over SPAL, which extended their lead at the summit to four points over Lazio, and six over Inter.

With fears over the coronavirus spreading, Prime Minister Conte confirmed on Saturday evening that the country's minister for sport had taken the decision to call off the games. A reported 42 amateur and lower-league games had already been called off in Italy this weekend due to the outbreak, with the number of confirmed cases of the virus increasing. There are now a reported 79 cases of people suffering from the Coronavirus, with two having died already. DON'T MISS Deontay Wilder reveals he considered shooting himself as a teenager Hearn explains why Joshua vs Fury would take place in Saudi Arabia Peter Fury makes Tyson Fury vs Anthony Joshua prediction A Serie B game between Cremonese and Ascoli has also been cancelled.

Emma Newburger@emma_newburger,2/22/2020,cnbc,Coronavirus live updates: IMF lowers global growth forecast,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/22/coronavirus-live-updates-imf-lowers-global-growth-forecast.html,"The coverage on this live blog has ended ” but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC's Asia-Pacific team. All times below are in U.S. Eastern time. The World Health Organization confirmed that over 77,794 people are infected with the coronavirus, with 2,348 deaths in China and 11 deaths outside of China. The number of coronavirus cases tripled in South Korea on Saturday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with the number of confirmed cases in the country surging to 433 from 156 over a 24-hour period. The surge in cases adds to fears among health officials that the virus, which has spread to 28 countries, could turn into a global pandemic. More than half of the cases in South Korea are connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, and over a thousand members have reported potential symptoms of the virus. The area surrounding the Christian sect's church in Daegu, a major city in South Korea, has become empty as businesses there shutter. World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with African officials from Geneva on Saturday morning to urge them to prepare for a potential spread of the coronavirus across Africa. Just one case has been confirmed on the continent, but health officials fear the increasing global spread of the virus, especially to countries with less developed health-care systems. WHO says it has shipped more than 30,000 sets of personal protective equipment to six countries in Africa, and is set to ship 60,000 more sets to 19 countries in upcoming weeks. It has also provided online training courses to 11,000 African health workers, as well as advice to countries on how to conduct screening, testing and treatment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Saturday that the virus will likely cut off 0.1% from global growth, and drag down growth for China's economy to 5.6%, which is 0.4% lower from its January outlook. ""But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,"" said International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting. Iranian health authorities said on Saturday that five people are now dead out of the 28 infected with the virus, which may have reached most of Iran's major cities, including Tehran. The fifth death was among the 10 new confirmed cases of the virus in Iran. The reported cases there suggest that the virus is being transmitted much farther than previously known or acknowledged. Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, who made the announcement on state television, did not say when the fifth person died. The rise in virus cases outside of China is threatening to turn the outbreak into a global pandemic, with more countries starting to shut down travel across borders. China's transportation sector is expected to start up operations again in late February or early March, a Ministry of Transport official told reporters on Saturday. Delivery service companies China Post, SF Express and jd.com have all resumed operations. The services are in high demand during the outbreak as people would prefer to order food and supplies online or have them delivered.",finance

Frederick Kempe@FredKempe,2/22/2020,cnbc,Investors need to face the warning signs in the global economy,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/investors-need-to-face-the-warning-signs-in-the-global-economy.html,"Global investors are being overly complacent about downside economic risks, aggravated but not limited to the growing impact of coronavirus. They are underestimating the forces that are changing the very nature of the world economy “ a growing degree of ""deglobalization"" in the face of U.S.-Chinese decoupling. At the same time, they are overestimating the power of monetary and fiscal stimulus to keep the global economic party going. When G-20 finance ministers meet this weekend in Riyadh, they'll do so at a time when all of the world's ten major economies are slowing “ and several confront recession. Next week, Beijing is likely to announce a delay in the meeting of its National People's Congress due to the coronavirus outbreak. This week, Apple raised fears of more global corporate troubles to come with a coronavirus-caused revenue warning. The full ripple effects of the virus, and of the economic impact of humans scared to be with other humans, will show up in first quarter results, in particular in tourism, travel and on all Chinese and global companies that depend on Chinese supply chains and markets. Despite all that, investor complacency persists in no small part due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how rapidly the world has changed, economically and politically. We are only in the opening pages of this new era of major power competition and technological change, and there's no model to ""price in"" its impact. Within democracies, the public's faith has been shaken in capitalism and globalization to produce results that deliver greater prosperity. Most recently, that has driven everything from the recent Irish election victory of Sinn Fein, to the UK's departure from the European Union, to the erosion of the German political center. Most dramatic is the growing possibility that U.S. presidential elections this year could produce a showdown between two populists of different stripes but similar decibels, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Both are septuagenarian insurgents who appeal to hard-core, unconventional constituencies, and that's prompted global concern that the new U.S. normal may be abnormal. All of that is unfolding against a backdrop of a major power test that at its heart is a systemic struggle between democratic and authoritarian capitalist models. Though traditional security analysts continue to worry about how U.S.-Chinese, U.S.-Russian or U.S.-Iranian tensions could unravel into armed conflict, the more likely outcome is a resource-sapping, continual competition that stops short of kinetics but involves information warfare, cyber assaults, and economic clashes ranging from trade wars to targeted sanctions. But let's get back to investors and their complacency, which is as easy to explain as it is increasingly hard to justify. Every time the global economy approached the brink in the decade since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, some intervening force pulled us back. The latest came last year when it looked as though the global economy might slow to below 2 percent GDP growth, generally considered a way to measure the onset of a global recession. Central banks stepped up. As the International Monetary Fund has pointed out, 49 central banks cut interest rates 71 times last year. The result was a 0.5 percent global GDP boost, according to the IMF. Monetary policy saved the day. Investors understand that coronavirus could be a major 2020 shock, but they are wagering again that something will prevent this from becoming an economic disaster. They realize the U.S. Fed and other central banks may have fewer monetary tools to deploy, so they are counting on increased fiscal stimulus from governments. For example, Chinese lenders on Thursday cut their one-year loan prime rate, which is used across the financial system, by 0.1 percent to 4.05 percent. The result was a rallying of Chinese stocks that day of 2.2 percent of the benchmark CSI 300 index. That followed the Chinese central bank's cut to its medium-term lending rate this week, as well as dozens of other measures Beijing has introduced in recent days to support businesses hit by the epidemic. The Financial Times reports that China's central bank thus far has made 300 billion RmB available to large lenders and local banks in hard-hit areas, particularly Hubei province. Even so, the S&P Global Ratings forecast that China's 2020 growth could fall to 4.4 percent from its 6 percent level last year, if the coronavirus hit continues through April. Most predictions of that sort probably err on the optimistic side, and it may be wishful thinking that China's economy will make up most of what is being lost once coronavirus recedes. At the same time, the eurozone economy barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2019, up only 0.1 percent from the previous quarter, the slowest rate since 2013. Germany had zero growth. Real GDP in the eurozone was up just 0.9 percent in 2019, the slowest rate since 2013. (With the UK now leaving the EU, its leaders failed to agree on their budget on Friday due to insoluble differences.) Governments across the world see these storm clouds, and a Bloomberg survey of economic forecasts shows that budgets are loosening in more than half of the world's 20 biggest economies, providing some of the fiscal stimulus that central bankers have been seeking from their government counterparts. Markets are wagering that the combination of fiscal and monetary measures will again prevent the worst. However, what if they're wrong? Other than the United States, major central banks are tapped out, some of them experimenting with negative interest rates. Some experts argue that our low interest rate environment allows greater borrowing for fiscal stimulus. That's risky business. Global debt is nearing $244 trillion, the highest level on record, and that's not a good record to be breaking. Public debt is the highest in advanced economies since WWII. In a recent Atlantic Council report, Global Risks 2035 Update, author Mathew Burrows explores a worst-case scenario he calls ""Descent into Chaos."" It starts with growing indebtedness hitting China first and then spreading to the Western world, triggering a worldwide economic meltdown. Burrows isn't in the business of predicting the timing of global downturns. Yet it would be unwise to take one's eye off this ballooning debt at this moment of uncertainty. Investors are counting on the playbook of the last decade to hold out for a little longer. That's a risky bet in this year of coronavirus, slowing growth, growing debt, and rising geopolitical uncertainty. We're near the end of a bull run that's in year ten of a seven-year cycle.

"Helen Regan, CNN",2/22/2020,cnn,Fears over containing novel coronavirus grow as cases outside China spike,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/22/asia/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-update-intl-hnk/index.html," Concerns are growing over the global spread of the novel coronavirus after a spike in cases outside of mainland China among people with no connection to China or the city of Wuhan, ground zero for the outbreak. World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that there was still a chance to contain the virus, ""but the window of opportunity is narrowing."" The WHO has called on countries to continue containment measures while preparing for community transmission, he said, adding that the outbreak could still go in any direction. ""We must not look back and regret that we failed to take advantage of the window of opportunity we have,"" he said. His words come as countries outside of China report a sharp increase of coronavirus cases -- particularly in South Korea and Iran . Italy has also reported two deaths, raising fears of self-sustaining epidemics. Read More Authorities in China's Hubei province confirmed an additional 366 cases of the virus on Friday, 45 fewer than the previous day, taking the total number of cases at the epicenter of the outbreak to over 63,400. The total number of cases in mainland China is now more than 76,200. The global death toll from the outbreak has reached 2,372 , after 109 deaths were reported in mainland China Friday, including 106 in Hubei, nine fewer than the previous day. Outside of mainland China, at least 17 people have died from the coronavirus, including five people in Iran.

On Saturday, South Korea reported a spike of more than 229 additional cases in 24 hours, bringing the country's total to over 433, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The number of cases in South Korea has soared from 28 a week ago. Two patients who have been diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the country, where the outbreak is centered around the southern city of Daegu. More than half of the country's cases are linked to the Shincheongji religious group in Daegu . On Saturday, South Korean health officials said that 9,300 members of the group will be tested and required to self-isolate as they try to get on top of the outbreak there.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martinfarrer,2/22/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: asymptomatic Wuhan woman shows why outbreak 'will be hard to stop',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-asymptomatic-wuhan-woman-shows-why-outbreak-will-be-hard-to-stop,"A 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan travelled hundreds of miles to another city where she is believed to have infected five relatives without showing signs of infection, scientists in China have said, offering fresh evidence that the new coronavirus can be spread asymptomatically. The case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested it might be difficult to stop. According to the study, by Dr Meiyun Wang of the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman travelled 400 miles (650km) from Wuhan to Anyang in Henan province on 10 January and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive. All five of her relatives developed Covid-19 pneumonia, but as of 11 February, the woman had still not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat. Scientists in the study were careful to qualify the conclusions by saying the evidence suggested the woman had infected her relatives. But they nevertheless warned that if the findings were replicated, the prevention of Covid-19 infection could prove challenging. World Health Organization officials have praised China's lockdown of millions of people as helping to buy time for the rest of the world to prepare for the new virus. But as hot spots emerge around the globe, such as South Korea and Iran, health officials are having difficulty finding and isolating the first source of the virus “ the so-called index case. This is fuelling concern that the disease has begun spreading too widely for tried-and-true public health steps to stamp it out. A number of spot fires occurring around the world is a sign that things are ticking along, and what we are going to have here is probably a pandemic, said Ian Mackay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia. The WHO has insisted that Covid-19 is not yet a pandemic and says countries outside China do not yet need more draconian measures. But the spike in cases outside China means the world could be running out of time. What we see is a very different phase of this outbreak depending where you look, said WHO's Dr Sylvie Briand. We see different patterns of transmission in different places. The WHO defines a global pandemic as a disease spreading on two continents, though some public health experts would call an outbreak a pandemic if the spread is over a wide area or across many international borders. Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University medical centre in Nashville, who was not involved in the Zhengzhou University study, said the Wuhan woman's case provided a natural laboratory to study Covid-19. Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill? The answer is apparently, yes, he said. You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn't. She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone. Key questions now, Schaffner said, are how often does this kind of transmission occur and when during the asymptomatic period does a person test positive for the virus.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martinfarrer,2/22/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: South Korea cluster drives huge rise in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-south-korea-sees-huge-jump-cases-china-hubei-wuhan-outbreak-,"South Korea has reported another huge jump in cases of coronavirus as the country fights to contain the spread of the deadly disease. The number of infections has increased by 229 to 433, officials said on Saturday, with most of the cases linked to the city of Daegu and surrounding region two hours south of Seoul. A 61-year-old woman in Daegu is believed to be at the heart of the rapid spread and is thought to have passed the infection to dozens, and possibly even hundreds, of fellow worshippers at the controversial Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Of the new cases announced on Saturday, 92 have been traced to patients or staff at Cheongdo Daenam hospital near Daegu. Most of the hospital's patients who have been diagnosed are those who had been staying as inpatients for mental illnesses, Seoul's vice health minister, Kim Gang-lip, told a media briefing. The area is, however, closely connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. It is the birthplace of its founder, Lee Man-hee, who has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and claims that he will take 144,000 people with him to Heaven, body and soul, on the Day of Judgement. County officials said on Friday that a three-day funeral was held for Lee's brother three weeks ago at a hall owned by the hospital. South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, on Friday called for a thorough investigation of everyone who attended the funeral and Shincheonji services. Kim said on Saturday that the outbreak had entered a serious new phase, but still expressed cautious optimism that it could be contained to the region surrounding Daegu, where the first case was reported on Tuesday. By Saturday morning, the city of 2.5 million and nearby areas counted 283 cases, including South Korea's first two fatalities in the Cheongdo hospital. The central government has declared the area as a special management zone and is channeling support to ease a shortage in hospital beds, medical personnel and equipment. Although we are beginning to see some more cases nationwide, infections are still sporadic outside of the special management zone of Daegu and North Gyeongsang province, Kim said during a briefing. He called for strong border controls to prevent infections from China and elsewhere from entering South Korea. Cases in South Korea have risen elevenfold since the 61-year-old woman became the 31st case recorded by the Korean centers for disease control and prevention on Tuesday. She had not travelled overseas recently, officials said. Busan, South Korea's second biggest city, recorded its first two cases on Friday. Several cases have been confirmed in Seoul although the source of infections “ what scientists call the index case “ has not been traced. Daegu is on full alert against the spread of the virus and has closed public buildings and delayed the start of the school term by a week. Its usually busy streets have been brought to a standstill. The exception was supermarkets where residents have been queueing to buy food and other supplies. Troops at South Korean and US military bases have been confined to barracks. Panic is taking hold, Daegu resident Huh Mi-yeon told Associated Press. People are scared of any situation where they would run into another person. In China, the national health commission said on Saturday that there were 397 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, down from 889 cases a day earlier. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 76,288. The death toll in mainland China had reached 2,345 as of the end of Friday. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 106 new deaths, while in the provincial capital of Wuhan 90 people died. President Xi Jinping has, meanwhile, written a letter expressing thanks to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the organisation's support in this month committing up to $100m for the global response to coronavirus, the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. I deeply appreciate the act of generosity ¦ and your letter of solidarity to the Chinese people at such an important moment, Xi wrote. Millions of people in China remain confined to their homes as the government tries to contain the spread of the virus, raising serious concerns about economy. But Liu Guoqiang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said on Saturday that borrowing costs would be guided downwards to help businesses stay afloat and that the impact of the virus would be limited. As the World Health Organization warned on Friday that the window of opportunity to stop the spread of the virus was narrowing, it appeared to be spreading more widely across the world. Four people have now died from the virus in Iran and Italy recorded its first fatal case on Friday night. The British government said that an evacuation flight had left Japan on Saturday morning with 32 British and European passengers from the ship on board, as well as British government and medical staff. The organisers of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games postponed training for their army of volunteers on Saturday due to the coronavirus outbreak, but said that there was no consideration of cancelling the Games. Some 100 passengers who were in close contact with infected people on board began disembarking from the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama on Saturday, local media said. They included the last batch of Japanese passengers to leave the ship while some foreign passengers were still waiting on board for chartered aircraft to be sent by their governments. Around 970 passengers disembarked earlier this week, including Britons who are expected to arrive back in the UK on Saturday. In Australia, six people evacuated back to Darwin from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive to Covid-19. Another three people who have developed symptoms were being tested on Saturday. There were 170 Australians on the evacuation flight and all were checked for symptoms before leaving Yokohama, where they had been kept on the ship.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe,2/22/2020,theguardian,South Korea screens thousands of religious sect members for coronavirus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/south-korea-tests-coronavirus-thousands-religious-sect-members,"Thousands of members of a secretive religious sect in South Korea are being screened for the new coronavirus after more than 430 cases were confirmed in the country by officials, one of several fresh clusters of the disease globally. More than 78,000 people around the world have been infected by the Covid-19 virus, with most cases in mainland China, though clusters that have unclear origins have emerged in Singapore, Iran and South Korea. In Iran, a sixth death was confirmed on Saturday, prompting Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, to say he was especially concerned about the country. So far, 28 cases have been identified across four cities, but experts have speculated that many more infections are likely to remain undetected, and it is believed cases that have since appeared in Canada and Lebanon are linked to Iran. Infections in the country are believed to have begun in the city of Qom, but it is unclear how. There is also uncertainty in Singapore, where eight out of 85 infections appear to have no links to previous cases, and in South Korea, where links to a controversial church are being investigated. On Saturday, Ghebreyesus expressed concern about cases that have been identified where a patient has had no contact with a confirmed infected person, and has not travelled to China. Although the total number of Covid-19 cases outside China remains relatively small, we are concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, he said. Most people who contract the disease experience mild symptoms, making transmission hard to trace. The virus's fatality rate is about 2%, according to initial data from China. Andrew Tatem, a professor within geography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, said: Prior to the recent news of apparent outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran, it seemed like the relatively low number of cases outside of China and with no link to travelling there pointed to hope that the virus could be contained. This recent news, particularly regarding Iran, is especially worrying. In the South Korean city of Daegu, where most of the country's cases have been concentrated, officials are racing to screen worshippers who they believe may have been exposed to the virus at a service run by a controversial church. The city's 2.5 million people have been advised to stay in their homes if possible, while officials are sending medical supplies and clinical staff. Across Daegu and nearby areas, 354 cases have been recorded. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Yoon-sook Lee, a restaurant owner in Yulha-dong, Daegu, said the city's streets were deserted. Those who are outside are half-running as if they are all in a hurry or being chased, she said, adding that people had been stockpiling water and instant noodles. I'm starting to feel panicky as I'm worried about my family. I have young children so I'm worried about them. I'm also getting really worried about how long this will go on as it will affect our family's income, she said. Her restaurant provides catering for events, but all orders have been cancelled. About 230 cases in South Korea have been linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, while scores of cases on a mental health ward at Cheongdo hospital may also be related to the sect. The exact source of these infections remains unclear. While health officials are trying to trace more than 1,000 people who had contact with a 61-year-old woman who attended services at the church, it is believed the virus was present before she tested positive. The church said in a statement on its website that it had more than 120 students in China enrolled on its bible course but had no physical building or meeting place. The church leaders have told us that this is a test by the devil as he is jealous of the expansion of our church and I believe that is the case, said one of the church's members, who asked not to be named but said she had not attended the service linked to the outbreak. I hope that this situation will make our church stronger. We get persecuted by other people as it is, so this situation is even tougher for us. The church is accused by many of being a cult and its members often remain distant from outsiders and do not disclose their beliefs to family and friends. Its leadership has shared the names of people who attended its services with the authorities, and about 1,000 are being assigned a government worker to monitor for any symptoms. Secrecy surrounding the sect, however, means such contact-tracing work is even more challenging. Worshippers attend small local services twice a week, as well as larger gatherings “ such as the Daegu service linked to the current cluster of cases. These bigger services can attract hundreds of people from across the country, where the church has a total of 230,000 members. Attendees kneel closely together on the floor, chant, and shake hands with those around them. The church said it had shut all branches and centres and was disinfecting its facilities. Members sat on the floor at services in order to allow as many people to attend as possible, it added. Across the city, large gatherings have been banned and nurseries closed, while soldiers have been forbidden from leaving their barracks after several military personnel tested positive. A Samsung plant in Gumi, near Daegu, that employs hundreds of people has also been closed after a worker tested positive. Italy has recorded two deaths linked to the virus, prompting officials to place dozens of towns in Lombardy and Veneto, in the north of the country, under effective lockdown. Confirmed case numbers in the country have risen to 79. In China, where more than 2,300 people have died in the outbreak, there were 397 additional cases on Friday. Tedros said the biggest concern continued to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems. Associated Press contributed to this report.",general

Only if you're a delusional Trump toady, Mr Pompeo",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/22/the-west-is-not-winning-and-donald-trump-america-first-is-to-blame,"When was the last time a British prime minister cancelled a White House summit with a US president? Possibly never. Yet that's what Boris Johnson did after a livid, cursing Donald Trump slammed the phone down on him in a row over the Chinese firm, Huawei. Now a planned tΓte-Γ -tΓte in Washington next month, already twice delayed, is off. Not postponed. Not rescheduled. Off. So much for Britain Trump, the servile moniker the president pinned on Johnson last year. So much for the special relationship. Perhaps it was always doomed to end in tears. Imperious, bullying American behaviour, political arm-twisting and shameless economic blackmail over a post-Brexit trade deal pose big problems for Britain in a time of deep uncertainty. But other US partners are in the same boat. If a reminder were needed, it came in the form of Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state and Trump's most influential adviser, who pompously lectured fractious European leaders at last weekend's Munich security conference. Pompeo reassured mutinous allies that, despite unilateralist, isolationist appearances, America remained committed to global leadership. The death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly over-exaggerated. The west is winning. We are collectively winning. We're doing it together, he declared. This is utter hogwash. And almost everyone outside a dishonest, self-deceiving circle of Republican stooges and Trump toadies knows it. Together? In many respects, the US and Europe are further apart than at any time since 1941. Pompeo's speech revealed a cold war mindset that crudely divides the world into friends and foes, separated by walls, missiles, sanctions, insults, and mutually assured dysfunction. For Pompeo, who referenced his formative experience as a soldier patrolling freedom's frontier in West Berlin in the 1980s, there is no middle way. It's a black-and-white world ruled by fear and force. It's pure regression. Pompeo laid into China over military expansionism, debt diplomacy and cyber threats. Fair enough. But if he wants things to change, he needs to talk calmly. The coronavirus epidemic, like Huawei's controversial G5 networks and Beijing's HS2 bid, shows how inescapably interdependent China and western countries already are. When Jaguar Land Rover runs short of parts, Apple iPhones grow scarce and Lake District B&Bs bemoan missing tourists, all because Hubei is stricken by a virus, it's plain the global die is cast. Whether for security, trade, political, or public health reasons, it's too late to isolate China. Whether for security, trade, political, or public health reasons, it's too late to isolate China Pompeo had it in for Russia and Iran, too “ another evil empire, in his telling, that wages campaigns of terror in the Middle East and right here in Europe. Strange, then, that Europeans mostly believe Trump's Iran vendetta to be dangerous and foolish. Stranger still how Trump sucks up to Vladimir Putin. Pompeo's broader theme “ that the west, representing freedom and democracy, is winning “ is no less daft. Only people with their heads stuck in the self-congratulatory, delusional cloud that frequently envelops Washington could seriously make such a ridiculous claim about the world in 2020. What kind of foggy thinking or wilful blindness allows a senior politician to indulge such complacency when, as he speaks, not so far away, hundreds of thousands of refugees are being mercilessly bombed on Idlib's freezing hillsides? Almost 10 years ago, Syrians rose up in search of the freedom and democracy Pompeo lauds. But they got precious little help from the west. The story of the war, in part, is the story of how the west lost Syria, lost other Arab spring countries “ and lost credibility everywhere. Or let's look at nuclear disarmament as the 1970 non-proliferation treaty's (NPT) review conference approaches in April. While the climate emergency dominates the news, nuclear weapons remain the fast-track route to Armageddon. Is non-proliferation a battle the west is winning? Hardly. Trump tore up a key medium-range missile agreement with Russia last year. Now experts fear the 2010 New Start strategic weapons treaty is headed the same way. Contrary to the spirit of the NPT, both the US and Russia are deploying new weapons, including low-yield, tactical warheads that increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, Trump's blundering, hypocritical efforts to force North Korea and Iran to forsake nukes altogether are a bust. Putin's Russia seizes territory in Ukraine, subverts other people's elections, and assassinates opponents in foreign cities without effective western punishment. The more China's brutal repression of its Muslim minority is documented, the more European governments look away. About this, at least, Pompeo is right. But he is dead wrong about Palestine and the Israeli land-grab recently endorsed by Trump. Such blatant theft overturns decades of binding UN resolutions. It makes a mockery of the international rules-based order “ and any semblance of justice. Might these and many other unaddressed crises, including Yemen, Kashmir and Myanmar's ethnically cleansed Rohingyas, reasonably be called wins for western values? Of course not. And away from conflict zones, new technologies, far from bolstering free societies, deliver ever more pervasive, pernicious means of monitoring, controlling and censoring citizens. Across the globe, the battlements of open governance are under attack while its defenders are betrayed from within. Authoritarian regimes are on the up. Intolerant rightwing populists and ultra-nationalist mini-Trumps are on the march. No, Mr Pompeo. America First may work for some in your country. But the west, meaning a multinational, democratic alliance that champions shared principles, aims and laws, is not winning. If this were a movie, it would be called How The West Was Lost “ with Trump as outlaw-in-chief.",general
Huizhong Wu,2/22/2020,reuters,Sealed in: Chinese trapped at home by coronavirus feel the strain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-quarantine/sealed-in-chinese-trapped-at-home-by-coronavirus-feel-the-strain-idUSKCN20G0AY,"During weeks holed up in her grandmother's apartment with 10 relatives and eating a restricted diet, Chinese teenager Li Yuxuan says tempers have frayed. Li and her family are among the millions of people across China's Hubei province, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, who are subject to official orders to stay at home amid attempts to contain the spread of the disease. Officials and volunteers have sealed off buildings, erected barricades and stepped up surveillance to ensure compliance with the ban on movement, measures that are taking a toll on many in the community. Every day there's fighting. Every day we sigh. Every day I'm scolded, Li, 19, told Reuters by WeChat from the apartment in Ezhou, a city near the provincial capital of Wuhan. Li said the family had eaten the same combination of white rice, cabbage and peanuts for three weeks, since gathering to celebrate the Lunar New Year last month, stinting on portions due to limits on the numbers of people from each household allowed out to shop. Cities and villages across China have taken measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 76,000 people in the country, killing 2,345, but the protocols in Hubei are the most extreme. The province, which is home to 60 million people, announced a sealed management policy a week ago that effectively prevents residents from leaving their homes, further isolating a population that has been living under a transport lockdown since late January. We bought vegetables today, but I don't know when we will go out again, Li said by WeChat on Friday, adding the family could now only buy food at the gate of their compound. Officials have promised to ensure sufficient food and medicine for residents and have also warned against hoarding or price-gouging. Sealed management will continue so that no one will go outside, but they must still be able to buy their daily necessities, Wuhan's newly appointed Communist Party chief, Wang Zhonglin, said last Sunday. Hubei's sealed management policy depends heavily on residential committees, a network of volunteers who carry out government and Communist Party orders at the grassroots level in coordination with private employees of residential compounds. One day last week, before her compound in Jingzhou city was completely sealed, 31-year old Vicky Yi said she was stopped at the gate by a volunteer when she tried to go out for groceries. Minutes later, an elderly woman walked past and out of the compound. Yi argued with the volunteer to let her out. He eventually yielded. These people in the compound, when they get even a little bit of power, they will use all their energy to try to get in your way, she said. It's like the Stanford prison experiment, she added, referring to the 1971 psychology experiment to investigate perceptions of power that assigned a group of the university's students to be either prisoners or guards. The Jingzhou government could not be reached by Reuters for comment. Online videos have shown police and volunteers using force to penalize residents for even gathering in groups. In one that went viral, and which caught the attention of the official People's Daily, volunteers flipped over a table where a family was playing mah-jong, and hit one of the players. There are some things, no matter how pressing the epidemic is, that should not be done, the People's Daily noted on social media of the incident, and the Xiaogang city government issued an apology. Non-residents are also caught in the Hubei net, with many who were in the province to visit relatives over Lunar New Year now stuck far from their homes and livelihoods. The rent, the water bill, the electricity bill, I still have to pay them, said 28-year old Cao Dezhao, who owns a small IT business in Jinan, in eastern Shandong province, but is stuck in Wuhan after he came to visit his in-laws. I could be bankrupt at the end of this epidemic. Experts say that essential needs, including monitoring of mental health, should be ensured for people under quarantine or containment measures. You have to address the basic rights and well-being of people: can they get their food and water? What is their mental health status? said Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. Hundreds of official 24-hour telephone hotlines for psychological support have been launched since the beginning of the outbreak, but many are overwhelmed. Wuhan, the Hubei city hardest hit in the epidemic, says it will ensure food and other necessities through group orders as supermarkets stopped selling to individuals. Some communities have arranged for vendors to come to the their compounds gates. Hubei has said drugs and other necessities must be delivered to residents. But Song Chunlin, whose daughter has psoriasis, a painful chronic skin condition, said she has been unable to receive delivery of the medication her daughter needs in the village where her parents live in Yichang, in western Hubei, while she herself has not been able to receive her allergy medication. The Yichang government did not respond to an emailed request for comment. I'm really in a difficult situation, Song told Reuters.

Carnival Corp. CCL, +4.15% was down 1.5%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, +1.48% down 2.5%, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, +6.54% down 3.5% in trading on Friday afternoon. The State Department reiterated that sentiment on a call with reporters on Friday. This is a dynamic situation and U.S. citizens traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities, the department said in a statement. The Diamond Princess, a ship operated by Carnival that is now docked at a port in Yokohama, Japan, has reported 634 cases and two deaths as a result of the virus. Separately, Carnival's Westerdam cruise ship, which eventually docked at Sihanoukville, Cambodia, had been turned away from other ports over concerns of sick passengers. All three cruise line operators have canceled voyages in Asia. Read our full recap of what U.S. companies are saying about COVID-19 . The travel industries have been particularly hard by the outbreak as dozens of countries have put into place travel restrictions. A new estimate from the International Air Transport Association predicts that COVID-19 may lead to $29.3 billion in lost revenue for airlines based on a scenario in which this outbreak has a similar impact on air travel demand to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also a type of coronavirus. Air France-KLM AF, +3.54% said Thursday it expects to lose β‚¬150 million ($163 million) to β‚¬200 million as a result of the outbreak. We have totally stopped operations to China for both the main and secondary cities, CFO FrΓ©dΓ©ric Gagey told investors on an earnings call. Separately, the Empire State Realty Trust Inc. ESRT, -4.79% , which owns the Empire State Building in New York City, told investors that there are currently only six weekly flights between cities in China and New York City. Chinese tourists accounted for 3% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2019. The Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board has said it expects to lose $921 million in direct spending from Chinese tourists in 2020. Norwegian, which anticipates losing 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020 after canceling 40 cruises in Asia, told investors on Thursday that customers began canceling cruises outside of Asia after the Diamond Princess was quarantined in Japan. Americans are now choosing to book cruises in Alaska and the Caribbean. You don't have to get on an airplane to get to the Caribbean ports, Norwegian CEO Frank Del Rio said on an earnings call. Those seem to be doing better than some of the more exotic or far-flung destinations. COVID-19 was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has largely shut down Hubei Province, home to Wuhan, and slowed or halted factory production and consumer spending across parts of China. The worldwide number of new cases of COVID-19 has continued to slow even as cases in South Korea doubled overnight and China's Hubei Province updated its figures to include a tally of cases diagnosed among prisoners. There are now 76,785 confirmed cases of and 2,249 deaths, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. That is about 1,000 new cases, compared with the 3,000 or so new cases that were being reported daily in early February. Hubei reportedly added 271 infections among prisoners to its tally, a move that prompted questions about whether there are other unreported virus cases in the country, according to The Wall Street Journal . Outside of China, a cluster of infections in South Korea led to the diagnoses of 100 new cases overnight, bringing the total number of cases to 204 there. South Korea has reported one death. In the U.S., there are 34 confirmed cases. That includes 21 people who were repatriated from Asia, including 18 from the Diamond Princess, and another 13 cases, including a new one confirmed Thursday by the Humboldt County health department in California. Here's what companies are saying about the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses: Ά Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, +4.00% said Friday that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to monitor the situation and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March. Ά The Coca-Cola Company KO, -1.00% said Friday it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola's global volume, the company said in January. Ά ITT Inc. ITT, +2.38% on Friday updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99. Ά Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, +0.71% expects its international business to have a very difficult second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal, CEO James Snee told investors. Ά Domino's Pizza Inc. DPZ, +0.00% said Thursday that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino's opened 80 net new stores in China.

A number of major Chinese cities were put into shutdown and hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens subject to controls in a bid to contain the outbreak. Dr Gerald Lyons, Chief Economist at Natwealth, warned coronavirus is having a dramatic impact on the global economy. Speaking on BBC Newsnight he commented: The world economy is slowing. At the beginning of the year, China and the rest of Asia looked likely to account for two-thirds of global growth this year. Now China is at a standstill and because of supply chains the rest of Asia including Japan have slowed sharply.   That inevitably means the world economy is already slowing and depending on how long that lasts it will slow further. Separately South Korea has declared an emergency' as 100 new cases have been confirmed in the country.

The email originated from outside Ukraine, according to a government statement, and it falsely claimed there were five cases of coronavirus in the country. In reality, there have been zero reported cases of the virus in Ukraine. But the email was sent the same day evacuees from China landed in the country, and some Ukranian residents protested the evacuees' arrival by blocking roads that led to medical facilities and, in some cases, by smashing the windows of the buses carrying those evacuees. To try and calm citizens, Ukraine's Center for Public Health released a statement saying reports of five cases of coronavirus were false, and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky published a Facebook post saying the evacuees were all healthy and that they would be quarantined for two weeks out of extra caution. Zelensky also urged citizens not to block their arrival. There have only been two confirmed cases of Ukrainians with the coronavirus, and they are among many who have been infected while on the cruise ship that was docked off the coast of Japan. They have fully recovered, reports BuzzFeed News. With so many people searching for information online about coronavirus, there is continued risk that people may come across misinformation and hoaxes about the disease, especially on social networks like Facebook and Twitter that are ill-equipped to handle fast-changing global news events and the flood of user-generated posts that accompany them. Recode has put together a good summary of some of the most pervasive corona virus hoaxes that have been widely shared.

Joseph Carey,2/22/2020,express,"Sony Xperia upgrade revealed, but something even better is coming next week",https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/1245655/Sony-Xperia-L4-announced-specs-features-release,"  Sony has announced the Xperia L4, a successor to last year's budget Xperia L3. The device boasts a number of design characteristics you'll find on the company's more premium Xperia 1 and Xperia 5 devices thanks to its 21:9 display aspect ratio and triple camera system but is targeting Android fans that don't want to break the bank with their next upgrade. The Xperia L4 comes with a 6.2-inch HD+ LCD panel that, unlike the Xperia 1 and Xperia 5, has a small teardrop notch at the top housing a single front-facing camera. Although the screen of the L4 may not have a pixel-packed resolution like the Xperia 1 and Xperia 5, its aspect ratio still makes it extremely appealing for consuming your favourite TV shows and movies without having to look at any annoying black bars. Of course, Sony isn't just pitching the L4 as a great media consumption device, the firm is also touting the device's productivity features too. The 21:9 aspect ratio should also make using apps in a split-screen manner more convenient and balanced. Turning the Xperia L4 over reveals a triple-camera system comprised of a 13-megapixel primary, 5-megapixel ultra wide-angle and a depth sensor. Don't expect the phone's photography prowess to match the likes of the Xperia 1 or Xperia 5 but hey, it's probably going to cost a whole lot less. Under the bonnet of the L4 you'll find Mediatek MT6762 Helio P22 processor along with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Battery-wise, you're looking at a 3,580mAh cell Sony claims will support fast wired charging. However, the wattage of the charging in question has not been disclosed yet. Expect the Xperia L4 to land sometime this spring “ pricing for the device has not yet been announced, but seeing as you can pick up last year's L3 for a mere Β£169.99, don't expect the L4 to have an eye-watering price tag.

During which, the Tokyo tech titan is expected to unleashed its next full-fat flagship. We may already have a pretty good idea of what to expect from Sony's next premium smartphone. That's because last month renowned tipster OnLeaks posted alleged renders of the device and claimed it could be called the Xperia 5 Plus. READ MORE: Google unleashes huge Android update to select few phones today, is YOUR device eligible? The handset was shown with a new all-screen design with smaller bezels than the Xperia 1 and Xperia 5. It also seems like the hardware will boast dual front-facing speakers, a quad-camera system and even a headphone jack “ you remember those right? Of course, it's anticipated Sony will fit its newest handset with the latest and greatest internals. Naturally, that means it's likely we'll see Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 inside along with a generous amount of RAM. Pricing and a release date for the Xperia 5 Plus is unknown.

Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China. Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak - to apply to return. The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who were successful would be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said. It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market, Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step. Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students. Chinese students made up almost 40% of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data. That broader population has grown by more than 10% over each of the past three years, contributing more than A$30 billion (Β£15 billion) to the domestic economy. Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within two weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country. Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempted from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb. 29. Reporting by Lidia Kelly; editing by Jane Wardell",business
Luke Chillingsworth,2/22/2020,express,Fuel pump: Petrol and diesel prices at theirΒ lowest levels sinceΒ 2019,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1245424/fuel-pump-prices-cost-lowest-level-petrol-diesel-duty," Diesel costs have plummeted by five pence per litre to its lowest rate since May 2018 after steady decline throughout early 2020, according to AA's Fuel Price Report. Analysis from the recovery group found petrol pump prices stood at 124.41 pence per litre with diesel at 127.66 pence per litre. The costs are staggeringly lower than prices recorded in mid-January which saw petrol at 128.01p per litre and diesel at 132.70 pence per litre. However, fuel pump prices could fall even lower, it has been suggested, after it was revealed retailer costs and profit was at its highest for more than a year. AA experts say the increased growth in the margin shows fuel stations across the UK are delaying passing on wholesale cost savings to consumers. Wholesale petrol prices fell to 35.3p per litre over the first two weeks of February and even with VAT additions, AA experts say there is a further 1p of potential savings to be made.

That's on top of the 57.95p in fuel duty for every litre of petrol and diesel consumed by UK drivers, creating a tax-take of nearly 63p from every pound the private motorist spends on fuel. He added: However much motorists pay in taxes and charges, it's never enough for the Government and councils who always come looking for more. The latest report comes just days after rumours that fuel duty prices could be increased for the first time in over a decade. The increase in costs would see the full duty price increase from its current 57.95 spend per litre and would likely signal an increase in overall fuel costs. Estimates show the most recent year of the freeze will cost the Treasury an extra Β£4.4billion in revenue which could be spent on public service spending.  Fuel duty tax could be set for a 2p a litre increase despite Boris Johnson claiming he had no intention to raise the charge during the election campaign. However, a group of Conservative MPs have planned to write to new Chancellor Rishi Sunak to commit to a freeze on fuel duty price or cut it even more. The backbenchers are concerned raising the cost could hit families from lower-income backgrounds which could backfire. Raising the charge could alienate many blue-collar workers in northern regions who voted for the party for the first time in December's General Election. Edmund King added: If the Prime Minister and Chancellor are serious about levelling up' they should leave fuel duty and Insurance Premium Tax well alone in the Budget. Many people on low incomes across the country, particularly in rural areas, are totally dependent on their cars for getting to work and for essential journeys. Fuel is a necessity for millions yet it is already taxed as a luxury at more than 60 percent. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
"Luke McGee, CNN",2/22/2020,cnn,A controversial religious group is at the center of South Korea's coronavirus outbreak,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/22/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-religious-group-intl/index.html," More than half of South Korea's novel coronavirus cases are linked to a branch of a controversial religious group in the southern city of Daegu. At least 231 of the country's 433 confirmed cases are associated with the Shincheonji religious group, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). The total number of cases reported in South Korea in the past 24 hours stands at 229, after 142 new cases were confirmed overnight. Around 9,300 Shincheonji members are being put into self-isolation and will be tested, the country's Ministry of Health and Welfare said Saturday. Investors are betting on a quick recovery from coronavirus. What if they're wrong? The Shincheonji is centered around the personality of its founder and chairman, Lee Man-hee. On a website believed to be the group's official homepage, the group heavily suggests that Lee is the ""Promised Pastor"" mentioned in the Bible. The passage it highlights suggests that the Promised Pastor is the second coming of Jesus Christ. Read More Members of the group congregate in a way that puts them in close contact with one another for long periods of time. KCDC Director Jung Eun-Kyeong said at a press briefing on Friday: ""(We are) seeing that there is a possibility that the characteristics of many people sitting close together in a very confined space and holding service for more than an hour ... (could have led to) a few who were exposed infecting many (other) infectees."" The group said it ""deeply regrets"" the outbreak which occurred in their Daegu branch, in a statement released online Friday. It said its ""services, gatherings, and mission activity"" have been stopped and all its buildings are being sanitized. Workers from a disinfection service company sanitize a street in front of a branch of the Shincheonji religious group in Daegu, South Korea, on February 19. The group also expressed concern over what it says is ""false information"" that has been circulating about it, especially reports that it is the ""'main culprit in the spread of virus,' referring to our 'unusual service style.'"" It added that it had to hold services on the floor to ""maximize the number of occupants in our small space -- which was due to Shincheonji not being allowed our rightful building permit."" CNN has attempted to contact the Shincheonji group for comment. The group has previously been described as a cult. John Everard, a former British diplomat and Korea expert, told CNN: ""There are all sorts of cults in South Korea. They [Shincheonji members] are generally regarded as not particularly malign. They hold beliefs that are a long way out of the mainstream and in Pastor Lee there is a real cult of personality. In that context, Pastor Lee's cult of personality isn't one of the most extreme, but it does exist."" The Church of England had also previously issued a warning about splinter groups in the UK in which it suggested the group was a cult. Fears over containing novel coronavirus grow as cases outside China spike As South Korea grapples with the outbreak, two patients who have been diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the country, according to the KCDC. The first patient tested positive for the virus after their death, according to the KCDC on Thursday. On Friday, KCDC director Jung said the victim had a chronic lung disease and had been hospitalized for a long period of time. Jung also stated that the second patient, identified as a woman born in 1965, was confirmed to have the virus on Friday. South Korean officials said on Friday that the two cities where the outbreak of the virus had been confirmed would be designated as ""special care zones."" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said: ""(The government) will carry out special measures by designating the Daegu and Cheongdo areas, which are experiencing difficulties due to a sudden increase in confirmed cases, as 'special care zones.'"" The government also plans to send military medical staff and prepare temporary isolation facilities for those who are unable to isolate themselves.",general
Maggie Fitzgerald@mkmfitzgerald,2/22/2020,cnbc,Here's how to tell a bear market is coming,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/22/heres-how-to-tell-a-bear-market-is-coming.html,"Trying to time the market can be dangerous, but there are certain signals that the professionals look for when trying to gauge future risk in stocks which could be helpful for regular investors to monitor. Bank of America Securities curated a ""bear market signposts"" list for clients to help predict when stocks might be close to embarking on a bear market. The list of 19 signals ranges from fundamental to sentiment-related indicators and uses data tracking back more than 50 years. Currently 63% of the bear market signposts have been triggered, up from 47% in January. Since 1968, when 80% of the indicators are triggered, a bear market occurred, meaning stocks fell 20% from their most recent highs. ""Stocks appear to be pricing in more good news than bad,"" Bank of America equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian said in a recent note to clients. The signposts list was almost triggered in October of 2018 when it hit 79%. The S&P 500 went on to briefly dip into bear market territory on an intraday basis following that signal, and suffered its worst December since the Great Depression. The Fed raising rates, as they did in 2018, is a trigger on the bear market signal list, as bear markets have always been preceded by the Fed hiking rates by at least 75 basis points from the cycle trough. Currently, if investors buy a 3-month treasury bill, they will be getting a higher yield than if they buy a 10-year treasury note. This is not normal. Typically, the more long term the holding period of the government security is, the higher the returns. This is a bond market phenomena called the inverted yield curve, which is known to precede recessions and sits as one of Bank of America's bear market sign posts. Another indicator that is currently triggered is muted price reactions for earnings beats this season. Stocks are getting their thinnest rewards for beating Wall Street's estimates on earnings since the first quarter of 2018 and the third lowest level since 2000, according to Bank of America. ""Historically, small rewards preceded negative S&P 500 returns 60% of the time over subsequent quarters,"" Subramanian added. Stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios are also currently underperforming, flashing a bear market warning sign. Stocks with low PE ratios are generally considered undervalued and can be a good buying opportunity. When investors don't buy into these cheap stocks it normally means they are crowding in high growth names. This means that the most expensive stocks are narrowly driving market returns. Another flashing signal is tightening credit conditions, which occurs when it becomes harder to borrow money from the bank. In times of uncertainty or an economic slowdown, banks will tighten their lending taps to hedge for risk. Each of the last three bear markets started when a positive percentage of banks tightened lending standards. A recent Fed survey showed banks expected credit standards to tighten this year. One indicator that remains at bay is Bank of America's Fund Manager Survey recommended cash levels staying above 3.5%. Typically, when fund managers are not recommending positions in cash to clients, it's bullish; however, Bank of America said it can be a contrarian measure of buy-side optimism. Therefore, since the current recommended cash position is above 4%, the signpost is not triggered. A change in long-term growth expectations is another indicator that is currently not triggered. While stocks are off their recent highs due to worries about the Chinese coronavirus and companies like Apple and Coca-Cola downgraded their earnings expectations due to supply chain disruption, the consensus seems to be that the financial fallout of the virus will be short lived. Near-term pain is being acknowledged; however, Wall Street firms are optimistic growth will recover in the second half of 2020. Another recent bullish signal is that consumer confidence in the U.S. grew more than expected in January as the outlook around the labor market improved. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 131.6 this month from 126.5 in December. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected consumer confidence to rise to 128. Any reading below 100 signals a bear market could be coming. When the Cboe Volatility Index, a commonly watched fear gauge, spikes above 20, it triggers another bear market warning sign. Despite coronavirus and U.S. presidential election uncertainty, the VIX sits below 17, which remains bullish for equities. To be sure, while this method developed by the bank has a good track record, it's always possible that different factors accompany the next bear market. And most professionals advise against trying to time the market based on technical factors such as these. Still, it could be a helpful exercise for regular investors to go through this list in order to gauge how much risk they should be taking with their investments. ” with reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom.

That's what some investors are scratching their heads about as they look out at the current landscape on Wall Street. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.43% , the S&P 500 SPX, +1.04% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.66% indexes drifted toward record territory”seemingly inoculated from coronavirus contagion. Speculative stocks like electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc . TSLA, +10.78% , and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc . SPCE, -1.07% , a space tourism company that only began trading publicly three months ago, also surged. Virgin's stocks is up 118% this month , while Tesla has gained more than 41% over the same period.

Gold prices US:GCH20 are trading near the richest levels since 2013 and the U.S. currency, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.04% , is hovering near its loftiest level against a basket of a half-dozen rival currencies, in more than a year. See: Can the stock market soar if the dollar continues to surge? What investors need to know Another asset, bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.36% US:BTCH20 is barreling above $10,000, approaching its highest level since August, according to FactSet data. Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, wrote that 19 exchange-traded funds were at or near records, including the iShares Global Infrastructure ETF IGF, +1.03% , Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF XLU, +1.88% and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN, +0.20% . Meanwhile, a number of bond-pegged ETFs, which wouldn't be expected to rise while equities are gaining, were also near their recent highs, including iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG, -0.11% and iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD, -0.18% . It's almost as if investors putting money to work this year can't lose, and that setup has caused some confusion among strategists, investors and analysts. Cappelleri said he's unsure if this is a true everything rally but advised caution. So, whether one thinks this is an everything' bull market or not, it's clear that various assets are rallying concurrently right now. And that makes it important to stay on the right side of those trends for as long as we can, he wrote on Wednesday. On Tuesday, hedge-fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told CNBC that he saw euphoria in pockets of the market. He said we're at the early stage of knocking on the door of euphoria but not quite euphoria. Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., said that the market's multiasset rise can be attributed to one thing: unprecedented stimulus. Notably, easy-money policies from the Federal Reserve, which has kept U.S. benchmark rates at a 1.50%-1.75% range, with investors betting that the central bank will be more inclined to cut rates than to raise them in the near term, particularly with China's COVID-19 outbreak emerging as a global threat. Antonelli said the viral outbreak accounts for much of the catalyst for the state of play across markets. The infectious disease that emerged in Wuhan, China last, year, has hamstrung the world's second-largest economy. How significantly it has hurt China remains to be seen. We know that China is basically sitting idle right now. Once the pandemic slows a bit more I'd expect to see some really massive injections both fiscally and monetarily from the Chinese, Antonelli told MarketWatch. They can't let this pandemic threaten economic growth because if it did, that could threaten political stability, he said. Fresh stimulus from China and an accommodative Fed may not provide much comfort, said Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at INTL FCStone. He paints a picture teeming with potential excess, where newly minted traders share screenshots of their extraordinary gains on Reddit and Twitter and savagely roast anyone who is not leveraged long their favorite highflying tech stocks. Deluard says one of his bigger concerns is that the rally isn't supported by solid fundamentals. He argued that by one measure, tracking stock price gains compared against a number of measures, illustrated that equity valuations are historically rich. The chart below shows the market value of the S&P 500 in aggregate compared against its replacement cost, or Tobin's Q; stock-market capitalization relative to gross domestic product; and the Shiller P/E, or price-to-earnings, ratio. Based on those measures, stock market caps represent 230% of GDP, Shiller P/Es are at their loftiest since 2000 and Tobin's Q is at a level last since in 1999, Deluard noted. Source: INTL FCStone On top of that, the profits of small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, +1.69% companies, meanwhile, have shrunk in each of the past four quarters, Deluard wrote. Source: INTL FCStone Even large-caps are not immune to the earnings recession: profits for the S&P 495 index (which excludes Facebook FB, +0.23% , Apple AAPL, +0.24% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.54% , Microsoft MSFT, -0.30% , Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +2.03% GOOGL, +1.34% ) declined by 3.9% in the past quarter. It's impossible to say how long this tandem rally can last. Legendary mutual-fund manager John Templeton once said that bull markets don't succumb to old age, but die in a bout of euphoria. And that notion may be swirling in a number of investors' minds as this bull market that began March 9, 2009, heads toward its 11th anniversary. Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon's Lockwood Advisors, told MarketWatch that all this apparent optimism may evaporate if the coronavirus's impact is greater than investors are betting. A number of strategists are playing amateur epidemiologist and I think that's a little bit of a challenge, Forester said. He also said some investments bets being placed currently also reflect that investors are playing defense, buying Treasurys as well as assets they think may grown in value. I think it's a function of investor positioning and sentiment. There's only been a few days of actual weakness so far in 2020, which means people have to keep chasing to keep up, Cappelleri told MarketWatch. Indeed, Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, in a Wednesday note, said that there were four distinct trading buckets in which investors are currently assessing the market: recession scare, defensive growth, momentum growth and value trade (see attached chart): Deluard said that what he describes a manic phase for stocks will eventually pop and lofty valuations and central bankers could be the cause. The main value of these examples is to illustrate that some of the largest stocks in the world have entered the manic phase, where mobs of leveraged individual investors have hijacked the normal price discovery process, he wrote in his research report. What could end this irrational euphoria? Deluard speculates that ultimately companies may significantly pullback on repurchasing stocks , which has been one of the key drivers of stock-market multiples. Buybacks, the single-largest source of demand for stocks in this cycle, will become the transmission channel through which irrational prices finally adjust to rising cost pressures, he wrote.

Michael Bloom,2/22/2020,cnbc,"Stocks hit by coronavirus worries but analysts say buy: Apple, Nike",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/22/stocks-hit-by-coronavirus-worries-but-analysts-say-buy-apple-nike.html,"The coronavirus continues to cause investor anxiety and market uncertainty, but Wall Street analysts told clients this week there's still plenty of quality stocks to own. CNBC combed through recent Wall Street research to find where analysts see buying opportunities amid the epidemic. The stocks include Apple, Qorvo, Kontoor Brands, Synopsys, ON Semiconductor, and Nike. Kontoor, the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, is likely to see some effect from the virus but the company's growing global platform should keep it fairly insulated from any long-term damage according to one analyst. ""Despite the likelihood, near term, of transitory headwinds related to the coronavirus, we think KTB remains well positioned to achieve its '20 and '21 financial targets,"" Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser said. The firm also said the company's strong management is another reason clients should own the stock. ""Patience is a virtue, and a stable strong dividend pays investors to wait,"" he said. The stock was down over 7% on the week. Shares of Nike are down more than 4% over the last month, but Morgan Stanley says it's still a great time to buy. ""Store closures will impact 3Q20 China sales results and may cause NKE to temper its full year revenue guidance,"" the analyst warned. The firm also said the virus could impact the company's gross margin progress, but added that any of these headwinds would be temporary. ""We expect the market to look past this transitory challenge and would add to positions on any pullback,"" they said. Apple surprised analysts and investors earlier this week when it said that it wouldn't meet its second-quarter revenue guidance as a result of the coronavirus. That announcement caused a sell-off in chip stocks and left one firm concerned about the ramifications on one of the tech giant's key suppliers, Qorvo. The company is a radio frequency chip supplier for the tech giant. ""This news will no doubt cause investors to question QRVO's $800-$840M Mar-Q revenue guidance given on January 29, despite QRVO's management addressing this topic last week at a conference and seemingly standing behind guidance,"" Wells Fargo said in a note. The firm urged investors to use caution and said that any supply chain issues would only be short term. ""We believe investors should buy on any weakness in QRVO's shares on the heels of the announcement issued by Apple,"" Wells said. The stock was down over 7% on the week. Here is a wrap of the stocks that have been hit by the coronavirus but analysts still say buy: ""The Coronavirus is wreaking havoc across virtually every hardware company with exposure to China in terms of supply disruptions and (to a lesser degree) demand disruption. Despite this headwind, however, design activity remains robust and SNPS has had no ill effects. Given that the lumpy nature of the Hardware and IP business, we view the softer than expected F2Q (Apr.) guidance as a non issue and would instead focus on the solid FY20 outlook."" ""While three of its China back-end facilities have returned online, two are operating at sub-optimal levels of 60%, while the third is at 90%. Moreover, ON is seeing customer order push-outs into 2Q and a slowdown in the backlog (both disty and original equipment manufacturer) across all end markets. While mgt. didn't quantify the impact, we believe it's prudent to lower our rev and GM ests. to reflect this concern. ... We believe the long-term drivers for GM expansion are powerful, namely the transition to 300mm and a favorable mix shift."" ""Despite the likelihood, near term, of transitory headwinds related to the coronavirus, we think KTB remains well positioned to achieve its '20 and '21 financial targets. The transition to one global operating platform should make the company more efficient in the foreseeable future. Hence, patience is a virtue, and a stable strong dividend pays investors to wait."" ""Store closures will impact 3Q20 China sales results and may cause NKE to temper its full year revenue guidance. We analyzed a range of outcomes with various revenue and EPS impacts. We expect the market to look past this transitory challenge and would add to positions on any pullback; reiterate OW. ... We expect GM will be relatively unchanged given NKE's low seasonal inventory obsolescence risk, and displaced 3Q20 demand could potentially become a 4Q20 revenue benefit. The coronavirus headwind should be temporary, but lost revenue in NKE's highest EBIT margin geography could delay its margin expansion progress by a quarter. No change to our longterm thesis."" ""Buyers on weakness. [Monday afternoon] Apple announced that it will not meet its FQ2 revenue guidance due to Coronavirus impacts in China - both supply and demand challenges. With the obvious greater focus on human health, the company noted that both iPhone manufacturing facilities and retail stores are opening more slowly than expected. Importantly, it also stated that demand outside of China remains strong and in line with expectations. Absent a longer running Coronavirus impact, we believe the broader story remains very much intact, and would be buyers on weakness."" ""Late Monday, QRVO's largest customer, Apple, announced it will not meet its original $63-$67 billion Mar-Q rev guidance issued on Jan 28. This news will no doubt cause investors to question QRVO's $800-$840M Mar-Q rev guidance given on Jan 29, despite QRVO's management addressing this topic last week at a conference and seemingly standing behind guidance. Although the coronavirus is still a serious issue yet to be fully controlled, we believe the supply chain issues and retail closures impacting the manufacture of, and demand for, smartphones in China may be temporary in nature. We believe investors should buy shares of QRVO on any weakness related to Apple's news.""",finance
Michael Brush,2/22/2020,marketwatch,"9 secrets of dividend investing, from a couple of stock pros who beat the market",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/9-secrets-of-dividend-investing-from-a-couple-of-stock-pros-who-beat-the-market-2020-02-19?mod=michael-brush,"Many income-focused investors dwell on dividend yield and buy largely on that basis. More income is better, right? Not so, say the two dividend-minded mutual-fund managers who run the outperforming Guinness Atkinson Dividend Builder Fund GAINX, +0.05% . Matthew Page and Ian Mortimer use a much more nuanced approach to get high-achieving results. Over the past three years, they have beaten both their Morningstar World Large-StockΒ category and the MSCI ACWI Index by 1.9 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively, on an annualized basis. That's a solid record given that most stock-fund managers lag their categories. So it's worth learning how Page and Mortimer operate to help you improve your own income-investing strategy. Their system starts by identifying companies with the characteristics that exemplify long-term outperformance. Then they fish in this pond, since these businesses are likely to continue doing well. It stacks the odds in our favor, says Page. Here are the qualities they favor, and other tips on how to succeed in dividend investing: 1. Go with dividend growers: Dividend stocks outperform, as a group, but companies with a history of increasing dividends do better, whereas companies with flat dividends tend to be more average. You want to own shares in companies that are likely to continue hiking dividends. To find those, look for these next four qualities. 2. Favor companies with a high return on capital: Companies with a long history of investing smartly in their business will probably continue to spend wisely. This means they'll have more sustainable cash flow, so they're more likely to keep hiking dividends. A good long-term investment record is key. Studies show companies with a great investment track record over 10 years have a 95% chance of repeating their success over one year, and an 80% chance of doing so over four years. There are many ways to measure corporate investment prowess, but Page and Mortimer use a gauge called cash-flow return on investment . They favor companies with a cash-flow return on investment greater than 10% for 10 consecutive years. 3. Go with moderate dividend yields: This sounds counterintuitive, but it makes sense if you think it through. First, having a moderate dividend makes it easier for a company to hike its dividend, simply because there is more room to grow. It's the law of large numbers, Mortimer says. Β Meanwhile, a high dividend is not always attractive. It means a company is less likely to hike payouts. Moreover, excessively high dividend yield due to a steep stock decline can be a sign of trouble. To identify promising companies in selloffs, the fund managers analyze the issue that's distressing investors, and favor companies with great investment track records. If a stock falls but it has high return on capital, you can make the argument there is a short-term issue, Page says. 4. Look for strong balance sheets: When a company is stretched, it is more likely to be forced by the market to cut its dividend to pay its debt, Mortimer says. This can hurt a stock. A strong balance sheet means a company is less likely to cut its dividend. 5. Go with cheap stocks: Page and Mortimer use valuation gauges such as price-earnings and free cash-flow yield. Be sure to compare a company's valuation to its peers or its own history, and not the market overall. Two of the fund's holdings that look reasonably cheap right now are ANTA Sports Products ANPDF, -2.04% and British American Tobacco BTI, +0.59% . ANTA Sports Products sells sports apparel in China, and the stock has been hit by coronavirus fears. (My take is the coronavirus is a temporary setback for companies .) British American Tobacco has been a weak stock because of health concerns about vaping, and increased Food & Drug Administration regulation of tobacco. We think they are being punished too much, Mortimer says of the stock. 6. Make concentrated bets: This is a tactic that many outperforming managers use successfully. It's better to know a short list of names and invest only in them. These two managers like a portfolio of 35 stocks, with each representing about 3% of the portfolio. In contrast, many actively managed funds stick to 1% positions to get the benefits of wide diversification, which can actually hurt performance. 7. Shop the world: Don't limit yourself to U.S. stocks. There are rich dividend payers around the world. The Guinness Atkinson managers aim for a 50-50 portfolio mix. The names singled out for this column are all non-U.S. companies, which makes sense from a valuation perspective because many international markets are lagging both the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% . Also, the fund managers recommend industrial conglomerate ABB ABB, +0.85% , whose shareholders may benefit from the sale of its power grid business, and Henkel HENKY, +0.77% , a consumer goods and chemicals business whose stock has been lagging in part because of automobile-sector weakness. 8. Hold for the long term: The Guinness Atkinson portfolio has a relatively low 24% turnover rate, and has kept a third of its positions since its 2012 inception, including Microsoft MSFT, +1.45% , Procter & Gamble PG, +0.70% , Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.89% , Aflac AFL, +0.70% and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A, -0.13% . 9. Get good at math: Page and Mortimer never went to business school, but they both have advanced degrees in physics from the University of Oxford. This is unusual in investing, but the experience has made them better investors because it helped turn them into quantitative analysts, influenced by numbers rather than stories.Β In this way, the fund managers are less likely to follow the crowd or focus on the size of dividend payouts. Says Mortimer: Rule number one: To get good dividend stocks, don't look at the dividend. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested MSFT, PG, JNJ and RDS.A in his stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks . He is a Manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the New York Times and The Economist Group, and he attended Columbia Business School.

Myra P. Saefong,2/22/2020,marketwatch,What a breakdown in the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil alliance would mean to the market,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-a-breakdown-in-the-saudi-arabia-russia-oil-alliance-would-mean-to-the-market-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"Saudi Arabia and Russia have so far failed to reach an agreement to cut oil production even with the  COVID-19 epidemic in China expected to significantly hurt energy demand this year, putting the more than three-year-old alliance between the two major oil producers at risk. Saudi Arabia is weighing a break in its alliance with Russia, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , citing people familiar with the matter. The Saudis are holding talks with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates this week to discuss a possible joint production cut of as much as 300,000 barrels a day, the report said. If the alliance were to split, the immediate reaction would be a drop in oil prices, but that could be reversed by a strong OPEC cut, said James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics. I doubt that OPEC is anywhere near a breakup, but the alliance between OPEC and non-OPEC producers is fragile. OPEC for decades wanted to get the Soviet Union and then Russia to become a member, he explained to MarketWatch. Since the 80s the Russians avoided it and it took the collapse of oil prices in 2015 and 2016 to bring them to the table. The rising shale production was the prime mover. The news Friday of a rift in the alliance followed a technical meeting earlier this month between members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known collectively as OPEC+. The committee in Vienna recommended that OPEC+ extend current production adjustments to the end of the year. The current agreement calls for OPEC+ cuts of 1.7 million barrels a day, from the October 2018 baseline, through March. The tussle between OPEC and Russia raises substantial doubt about continuation of production cuts and therefore a return to a heavily oversupplied market, said Manish Raj, chief financial officer at Velandera Energy. The market is factoring in the possibility of a total breakdown of the OPEC+ alliance, which can boost supplies by [two to three] million daily barrels in an already oversupplied market. Reported comments from Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Friday, however, helped to pull oil prices off their lows. This is absurd and utter nonsense, the energy minister told Reuters on Friday, referring to the media report that the Saudis were considering a break from the OPEC+ alliance with Russia. On Friday , April West Texas Intermediate crude US:CLJ20 fell by 50 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $53.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. April Brent crude UK:BRNJ20 , the global benchmark, ended at $58.50 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, down 81 cents, or 1.4%. In the past, Saudi Arabia has been adamant that all production cuts be shared pro rata between OPEC and Russian alliance members, said Raj. The money question is whether OPEC would continue to shoulder all the cuts on its own without pro rata participation from Russia. The market believes it won't, and this fear is weighing in on the oil price Friday. The technical committee in Vienna earlier this month also recommended that the group proceed with an additional adjustment until the end of the second quarter. During that meeting Russia, however, rejected a Saudi push to curb output by an additional 600,000 barrels per day, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that Russian officials don't see a need for reductions as the impact of the virus in oil demand is limited and they expect weaker demand to be offset by reduced supply from an oil shutdown in Libya and new sanctions targeting Venezuela's crude sales. If the cuts were to be implemented in the second quarter and demand starts to revive by that time, the OPEC+ alliance could just lose more market share to unconventional producers, said Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit. If the viral outbreak isn't contained by March 5-6, I would expect the group to adopt the deeper cuts, he said. The International Energy Agency recently lowered its view on world oil demand growth to the lowest level since 2011 due to the coronavirus outbreak. The IEA cut its growth forecast for 2020 by 365,000 barrels a day to 825,000 barrel a day. But if it does appear that the rate of [coronavirus] infections has peaked, no additional cuts would likely be adopted, said Steeves. OPEC and OPEC+ will hold their next official meetings on March 5 and March 6 in Vienna. In the short term, Williams said he expects the Saudis, Kuwait and UAE to cut even more to shore up the market in the face of the impact of the coronavirus impact on Chinese and global demand.",business
Myra P. Saefong,2/22/2020,marketwatch,"Gold's rise to near 7-year highs feeds talk of a climb to record prices of $2,000 and beyond",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/golds-rise-to-near-7-year-highs-feeds-talk-of-a-climb-to-record-prices-of-2000-and-beyond-2020-02-19?mod=article_inline,"Gold prices now trade at their highest levels in almost seven years, as the economic impact of the  COVID-19 epidemic in China has raised expectations for stimulus from global central banks to sustain economic growth, feeding talk of record $2,000-an-ounce prices and beyond for the precious metal. The markets are in the throes of a weird mix of safe-haven and speculative motivations, said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter. The U.S. dollar and stock market are benefiting from an influx of global funds looking for security during the coronavirus uncertainty, but stocks domestically and worldwide are also joining gold and silver in expectation of central bank stimulus to counteract whatever the economic effects may be. So, for now at least, fear and greed are combining to move most markets higher, Lundin said on Wednesday. Prices may hit a record level of $2,000 before the end of next year, he said. The timing of that would keep the market from overheating and give investors more time to make more money in mining equities, which typically over leverage to gold's moves. Based on records going back to November 1984, the record intraday level for most-active gold futures stands at $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011, with the settlement record at $1,891.90  from August 22, 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Futures prices on Wednesday tallied a fifth consecutive session gain , with April gold US:GCJ20 up $8.20, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,611.80 an ounce. The metal marked its highest settlement since March 2013. The precious metal conquered the $1,600 level as market players evaluate the global economic damage caused by the virus outbreak, Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM, told MarketWatch. With global growth concerns back on the table and speculation rising over central banks turning up the taps on looser monetary policy, gold is positioned to push higher. Gains for gold came despite a climb Wednesday in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.36% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.14% to record intraday records. Lundin believes gold will do far more than beat that record. Adjusting for inflation, in order to match the record of $850 set in January of 1980, gold would have to trade for about $2,805 in today's dollars, he said.  I think we'll set a new record in real terms, exceeding $3,000, at some point over the next four years or so.'  ” Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter I think we'll set a new record in real terms, exceeding $3,000, at some point over the next four years or so, he said. In a note Wednesday, commodity strategists at Citi said gold prices may see nominal highs of $2,000 an ounce in the next 12 to 24 months, according to Barron's . For the shorter term, they upgraded their six- to 12-month target to $1,700 per ounce. Prices had topped $1,600 an ounce on Tuesday for the first time since 2013. Lundin had attributed that move to anticipation of the flood of central bank stimulus that is all but guaranteed by the effects of the greater economic fallout from the coronavirus to date. Read: Why gold prices topped $1,600 and may soon hit a more than 7-year high Also see: Why silver prices may climb to their highest yearly average since 2014 The World Health Organization reported on Wednesday 75,203 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the new coronavirus that was first identified late last year in Wuhan, China. There have been at least 2,009 deaths from the virus, WHO said. China has taken steps to boost its economy, and the People's Bank of China reduced its one-year lending rate on Monday. Read: China may postpone annual congress because of virus Investors have revised down their expectations for interest rates in the US in a year's time by 20 [basis points] since the virus outbreak on 20th January, presumably because they think that the [Federal Reserve] will respond in the same way as the PBOC, said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics, in a note Wednesday. That has prompted real bond (TIPS) yields in the US to fall well below zero. And since gold is a non-interest-bearing asset, it has benefited, as often happens, from lower real yields. However, Capital Economics believes the rally in gold will end before long, said Gambarini. We doubt that the outbreak will prompt the Fed to cut rates further, she said. The almost unchanged statement issued at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on 29th January...suggests as much. Minutes from the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting released Wednesday after the gold futures settlement revealed that officials from the central bank believed the U.S. economy seemed stronger in late January than they had expected. Read: Fed officials more upbeat about the economic outlook this year, minutes show Just last week, Fed policymakers said that, while they were paying attention to the economic risks of the outbreak, the virus has not altered their outlook for the US economy, Gambarini said early Wednesday, ahead of the FOMC minutes. In our view, the Fed would only loosen policy if there were evidence of significant economic costs at home, alongside a large and sustained drop in equity prices. So far there is little sign of either.",business
Nigam Arora,2/22/2020,marketwatch,Gold breakout's while the stock market is rising should concern investors,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-breakouts-while-the-stock-market-is-rising-should-concern-investors-2020-02-20,"Momentum investors, who are relentlessly pushing up stocks, are oblivious to the breakout in gold amid a relatively rare event. Because of that, prudent investors should pay attention. Let's explore the issue with the help of a chart. Chart Please click here for an annotated chart of SPDR Gold Shares GLD, +0.59% , a gold exchange traded fund. Note the following: Ά The chart shows the previous resistance line, which has now become the support line. Ά The chart shows a technical breakout in gold. This is a positive for gold but negative for stocks. Ά The chart shows the breakout occurred after two shallow pullbacks. This is a positive for gold. Ά The chart shows that the breakout is occurring on four rare things coming together. Ά Gold is priced in dollars. For this reason, when the dollar rises, gold falls. Lately the dollar is becoming stronger, but gold is jumping instead of sinking. Ά Typically gold goes down when the stock market goes up, especially if there is an aggressive increase in the stock market, as has been happening lately. However, gold has broken out as the stock market has ascended. Ά Gold typically goes up when there is a new safe-haven event, such as war. Here, gold did not break out on the emergence of the coronavirus crisis. However, now that the coronavirus scare has been subsiding, gold is moving up. Gold breaking out under these circumstances is rare. Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora . Ά The smart money (professionals) has not been buying gold until now, but it has jumped in with light buying. This behavior is rare, as the smart money typically buys on pullbacks. Ά This breakout in gold is of major significance, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% is in a strong uptrend and investors' portfolios concentrated in mega-caps such as Apple AAPL, +0.64% , Amazon AMZN, -0.40% , Facebook FB, +1.52% and Alphabet GOOG, +0.54% GOOGL, +0.46% . Ά Semiconductors have been the leading indicators of the stock market. Investors should keep a careful watch on semiconductor stocks such as AMD AMD, +0.95% , Micron Technology MU, -0.61% , Nvidia NVDA, +2.86% and Intel INTC, +0.44% . Semiconductors are overbought and vulnerable. Ά Investors should also keep an eye on short-squeezes in stocks such as Virgin Galactic SPCE, +7.00% , Tesla TSLA, -1.29% , Enphase ENPH, -5.85% and SolarEdge SEDG, -4.48% . Ά There are new concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on earnings. Investors should stay tuned to the news from China as well as to earnings-related announcements. What does it all mean? Stay cautiously bullish on stocks and consider adding gold, silver and precious-metals stocks on pullbacks in the broader market. Among ETFs, consider watching iShares Silver Trust SLV, +0.50% , VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -0.30% and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ, -0.51% .

Nigam Arora,2/22/2020,marketwatch,"If you could buy only one stock for 5G and artificial intelligence exposure, this would be it",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-you-could-buy-only-one-stock-for-5g-and-artificial-intelligence-this-would-be-it-2020-02-14?mod=article_inline,"During the California gold rush, many miners went bankrupt. However, many of the merchants selling picks and shovels became rich. Most investors recognize that the gold rush is on in 5G and artificial intelligence. The gold rush is also on in automotive electronics. Just take a look at a massive move in Tesla's stock TSLA, +10.78% . (See this comparison of Tesla and other tech stocks and this analysis of Tesla's share-price movement .)  The picks and shovels for the present-day gold rushes are semiconductors.  If you could buy only one stock to take advantage of all of these trends without worrying about which companies will succeed, what would it be? Let's explore with the help of a chart. The chart Please click here for an annotated chart of Applied Materials Inc.'s stock AMAT, -1.41% . Note the following: Ά‰5G and artificial intelligence are huge users of semiconductors. Ά‰In addition to the gold rushes noted above, there are more gold rushes in IoT (Internet of Things), consumer devices, renewable energy, power management and data centers. Ά‰The picks and shovels for the present-day gold rushes are semiconductors. Ά‰Picks and shovels were easy to make; semiconductors are getting increasingly complex. Ά‰Applied Materials is a vendor of equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing. Ά‰Applied Materials is a second derivative, and semiconductors are the first derivative of the gold rushes. Ά‰There is an advantage to a large second-derivative semiconductor company such as Applied Materials. For example, Intel INTC, +1.90% was big in data centers, and Advanced Micro AMD, -2.40% wasn't much of a factor. When AMD stepped up with new designs, it started eating Intel's lunch. Also read: Daniel Newman on why AMD's best days are behind it Another example is Nividia NVDA, -0.28% , which has reported excellent earnings . In an Arora Report analysis, Nvidia has a one-year lead in many facets over its competitors. However, prudent investors should be concerned not only about potential rewards but also potential risks. How long will Nvidia maintain its lead? Take a look at Nvidia's chart, and you will see it has gone parabolic. Start your analysis with Arora's Second Law of Investing and Trading: Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets. In your risk analysis, ask yourself the following question: How would the chart look if Nvidia started losing its lead? You could easily lose 50% to 80% of your money. In contrast to the examples above, Applied Materials has relatively low risks in the long term: Ά‰The chart shows a nicely upward sloping trend line. This is a positive. Ά‰The chart shows a new trend line with a higher slope that started forming last year. This is a positive. Ά‰The chart shows that the recent pullback was shallow. This is a positive. Ά‰The chart shows that during the pullback, the accelerating trend line held. This is a positive. Ά‰The chart shows that Applied Materials reported good earnings. Ά‰Earnings were better than consensus and whisper numbers. Ά‰The chart shows a technical breakout for Applied Materials stock. This is a positive. Ά‰The chart shows the stock breakout occurred on heavy volume. This is a positive. Ά‰RSI shows that Applied Materials stock is overbought but there is room to run. Ά‰When a stock with steadily rising trend lines breaks out like Applied Materials has done, RSI should be used only for tactical purposes and not for strategic stock selection. Ά‰The chart shows a cup and handle pattern. This is a positive pattern in the stock market especially when a breakout occurs on heavy volume. ΆSemiconductor stocks have outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.43% , the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, +1.02% and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, +0.68% , which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX, +0.76% . Megacap tech stocks The stock market is led by the five megacaps : Apple AAPL, +0.24% , Amazon AMZN, +0.54% , Facebook FB, +0.23% , Alphabet GOOG, +2.03% GOOGL, +1.34% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.30% . Apple is an obvious user of semiconductors. Many investors are oblivious to the fact that other megacaps are also huge users of semiconductors in their data centers. These megacaps are making significant progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning. To gain an edge in megacap technology stocks and semiconductor stocks, consider using segmented money flows . China boost The U.S. dominates the semiconductor industry, and therefore China is highly dependent on U.S. companies. During the trade war, President Trump effectively used the U.S.'s position in semiconductors as a Sword of Damocles. It is natural for China to try to get out of this situation. Sooner or later the coronavirus will run its course. When China gets in the mode of increasing its semiconductor abilities, Applied Materials will benefit. More on AMAT: This U.S. company will benefit as China tries to catch up in semiconductors When and how to buy This stock market is controlled by the momo (momentum) crowd. If you have drunk the Kool-Aid of the momo crowd, then it is real simple: Buy shares of Applied Materials and keep in mind that semiconductor stocks are very volatile. What if you are a prudent investor? Then you need to bring significant sophistication to buying, holding and managing this stock. The chart link above shows the Arora buy zone. Is there any advantage to being prudent anymore? Applied Materials' stock is carried in our Model Portfolio from an average buy price of $16. Since our original buy, the stock has fallen numerous times into our newer buy zones, giving investors excellent opportunities. Often when the momo crowd was losing money and its stops were hitting, we were buying the stock. The answer to the question asked at the beginning of this paragraph is yes ” in the long term you will generate higher risk-adjusted returns. Other 5G stocks include Qorvo QRVO, -0.97% , Qualcomm QCOM, -0.79% and T-Mobile TMUS, +0.82% . Note that Sprint US:S is being acquired by T-Mobile.

"Paul LeBlanc, CNN",2/22/2020,cnn,"Trump furious after officials let Americans with coronavirus return to US from Japan, Washington Post reports",https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/politics/trump-coronavirus-cruise-ship/index.html," President Donald Trump became enraged with senior advisers this week when 14 Americans who tested positive for the coronavirus were brought back to the US from Japan after he had been told they would remain quarantined overseas, administration officials told The Washington Post. The President was first told that Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the coronavirus has spread, would be flown back to the US on two planes but that patients with the infection or with symptoms would stay in Japan, where the ship is anchored, the newspaper reported. However, the State Department and a US health official decided to bring back the infected Americans on the planes and place them in isolation without telling the President, the Post said. Administration officials told the Post that Trump learned of the reversal only after the fact and complained that the decision might damage his administration's handling of the outbreak. The Post previously reported there had been tensions between the State Department and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the decision to allow asymptomatic Americans who had tested positive for the coronavirus to travel back to the US along with other passengers who had not. Read More A State Department official told reporters Friday that an execution plan was already underway when Japanese lab results became available. ""I think the folks on the ground did just the right thing, by -- out of an abundance of caution -- moving those 14 people into an isolation area where they pose no threat to themselves or anyone else, to provide room for a robust inter-agency discussion between not just CDC and state, but really the operational elements of HHS,"" said Dr. William Walters, executive director and managing director for operational medicine at the State Department's Bureau of Medical Services. ""At the end of the day, the State Department had a decision to make, informed by our inter-agency partners, and we went ahead and made that decision,"" Walters said. ""And the decision, I think, was the right one in bringing those people home."" US officials have now confirmed at least 35 cases of the coronavirus in the country, the CDC said Friday. CNN's Michael Nedelman and Ben Tinker contributed to this report.",general

A total of 234 infections among Chinese prisoners outside Hubei ended 16 straight days of declines in new mainland cases. Another 271 cases were reported in prisons in Hubei - where the virus first emerged in December in its now locked-down capital, Wuhan. U.S. stocks sold off and the Nasdaq had its worst daily percentage decline in about three weeks on Friday as the spike in new coronavirus cases and data showing a stall in U.S. business activity in February fueled investors' fears about economic growth. The rise in coronavirus cases sent investors scrambling for safe havens such as gold and government bonds. Chinese state television quoted Communist Party rulers as saying the outbreak had not yet peaked amid a jump in cases in a hospital in Beijing. Online site for coronavirus news - here Graphic: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus - here Total cases of the new coronavirus in the Chinese capital neared 400 with four deaths. China has reported a total of 75,567 cases of the virus to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 2,239 deaths. In the past 24 hours, China reported 892 new confirmed cases and 118 deaths. U.S. activity in the manufacturing and services sectors stalled over growing concern of the potential toll of the virus, a survey of purchasing managers showed on Friday. The IHS Markit flash services sector Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to its lowest since October 2013, signaling that a sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy was in contraction for the first time since 2016. Data also showed Japan's factory activity suffered its steepest contraction in seven years in February, underlining the risk of a recession there as the impact of the outbreak spreads. Asian and European stocks also fell. [MKTS/GLOB] The impact of the outbreak on global growth may be large given China's role in the world economy, and may stress financial markets just as tensions over a U.S.-China trade war did in 2019, Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro said on Friday. The outbreak may curb demand for oil in China and other Asian countries, depressing prices to as low as $57 a barrel and clouding growth prospects across the Middle East, the Institute of International Finance said. The WHO warned that the window of opportunity to contain the international spread of the epidemic was closing after cases were reported in Iran and Lebanon. An outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy worsened on Friday as officials announced and 78-year-old man was the first Italian to die after being infected. The man was among 17 confirmed cases, including the country's first known cases of local transmission. The virus has emerged in 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing 11 people, according to a Reuters tally. There still is a chance we can focus principally on containment, but it's getting harder because we're getting secondary chains of transmission in other countries now, said Dr. William Schaffner, a U.S. infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University. The spike in cases in jails in the northern province of Shandong and Zhejiang in the east made up most of the 258 newly confirmed Chinese infections outside Hubei province on Friday. Authorities said officials deemed responsible for the outbreaks had been fired and the government had sent a team to investigate the Shandong outbreak, media reported. Hubei, adding to case-reporting confusion, doubled the  number of new cases it initially reported on Wednesday to 775 from 349. The lower number was a result of going back to counting only cases confirmed with genetic tests, rather than including those detected by chest scans. South Korea is the latest hot spot with 100 new cases doubling its total to 204, most in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million, where scores were infected in what authorities called a super-spreading event at a church, traced to an infected 61-year-old woman who attended services. South Korean officials designated Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo county as special care zones where additional medical staff and isolation facilities will be deployed. Malls, restaurants and streets in the city were largely empty with the mayor calling the outbreak an unprecedented crisis. Another center of infection has been the Diamond Princess cruise ship held under quarantine in Japan since Feb. 3, with  more than 630 cases accounting for the biggest infection cluster  outside China. Australia said on Saturday that four more of its nationals evacuated from the cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus in addition to two individuals previously identified. Some 35 British passengers were due to arrive back home on Saturday after spending more than two weeks stuck on the quarantined. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday that of 329 Americans evacuated from the ship, 18 have tested positive for the virus. A second group of Chinese citizens from Hong Kong who had been aboard the Diamond Princess have been flown home from Japan, Xinhua News reported. In the Iranian city of Qom, state TV showed voters in the parliamentary election wearing surgical masks after the country confirmed 13 new cases, including two deaths. Health officials on Thursday called for all religious gatherings the holy city of Qom to be suspended. Ukraine's health minister joined evacuees from China for two weeks' quarantine in a sanatorium on Friday in a show of solidarity after fears over the possible spread of coronavirus led to clashes between protesters and police.

Sunny Oh,2/22/2020,marketwatch,30-year Treasury bond yield breaks to all-time low as coronavirus fears lift havens,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/30-year-treasury-bond-yield-breaks-to-all-time-low-as-coronavirus-fears-lift-havens-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"U.S. Treasury yields extended their weeklong slump on Friday as investors worried that the economic impact of COVID-19 may not be contained to China, and is spilling over into neighboring regions. What are Treasurys doing? The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.634% fell 5.4 basis points to a more than five-month low of 1.470%, contributing to a weeklong decline of around 12 basis points. The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.152% slipped 4.5 basis points to a three-week low of 1.348%, extending a 7.6 basis point drop this week. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.335% tumbled 5.4 basis points to 1.917%, sliding below its previous all-time low of 1.95%. The long bond's yield fell 12.6 basis point this week. See : Here's three reasons why the 30-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low What's driving Treasurys? Global equity benchmarks and U.S. stocks tumbled Friday as the growing number of cases of the coronavirus outside China, especially in South Korea, raised fears that the damage to supply chains could hit several major Asian economies which are linchpins for industries like semiconductors and automobiles. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.04% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.43% are set to book a more than 1% loss this week. Investors also said it's unclear when workers will be able to return to factory floors. Some forecasters suggest car manufacturing and other industries may not return to usual production activity until March. The bearish investor sentiment in risk assets helped boost demand for haven bonds, which have seen sharp inflows all week. Long-term Treasury yields are on the verge or have already broken through key levels that investors say could presage further yield declines. Worries about a Chinese and Asian economic slowdown spilling over into the U.S. have also lifted traders' expectations for interest rate cuts later in the year, despite speeches by senior Federal Reserve officials including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida suggesting no further easing was imminent. Investors saw a flurry of speeches from Fed officials on Friday. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said they expected the coronavirus to be a temporary shock. Disappointing economic data also added to the yield decline. The IHS Markit purchasing manager survey's composite index for the U.S. dropped to 49.6 in February, a more than six-year low. Any number below 50 represents a contraction in economic activity. While, existing home sales ran at annualized pace of 5.46 million, a drop of 1.3% in January.

Therese Poletti,2/22/2020,marketwatch,"The 5G rollout is already behind, and coronavirus could slow it even more",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-5g-rollout-is-already-behind-and-coronavirus-could-slow-it-even-more-2020-02-21?mod=technology,"The slow 5G network rollout was already causing confusion and disappointment for tech investors, but a sudden sickness has made it worse. COVID-19, a disease caused by a coronavirus that has been spreading in and from China, could further exacerbate an already slower-than-expected spread of the new wireless-network protocol. The entire tech sector is feeling the fallout from the epidemic, which is close to being labeled a pandemic with over 76,000 confirmed cases, mostly in China, where more than 2,200 people have died, and the numbers are rising daily. Analysts at Omdia, a global technology research firm, said as the coronavirus spreads through tech's global supply chains, it is impacting the diverse yet interconnected sectors of the electronics industry. But especially hard hit will be products related to 5G, because it is in the throes of starting up. With the epidemic arriving at dawn of 5G's mainstream deployment phase, the coronavirus has the potential to disrupt the progress of the next-generation wireless standard, as the crisis slows or threatens to slow the production of key smartphone components, including displays and semiconductors, Omdia analysts wrote last week. We believe that China will take a significant position in the 5G era in both supply and demand of devices and network-wise, Omdia analyst Jusy Hong said in an email interview. The coronavirus outbreak will slow down production of network equipment and devices. Also, the outbreak is depressing the local economy of China and this will freeze smartphone demand in the country. Read also: The long-promised Year of 5G' arrives with more promises and little 5G The spread of 5G technology is two-pronged: Networks must be deployed, and devices that can use those networks have to be developed, launched and sold. On the network side, Asia and Europe are seen as ahead of the U.S. in 5G, but they are still also in early stages of deployment and coronavirus could certainly slow progress overseas. Check out this daily column: Coronavirus update: 75,748 cases, 2,129 deaths, Norwegian Cruise and Ecolab expect hit to EPS That progress already was running slow before coronavirus, it seems. Xilinx Corp. XLNX, -1.49% ” which sells chips for 5G base stations ” said in its January earnings report that there was a pause in sales for infrastructure. Ominous warnings about the effects of coronavirus have turned into a chorus in more recent tech earnings reports, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, +1.18% Chief Executive Daniel Zhang going as far as describing it as a Black Swan event. Those two negative elements just add to what was already a confusing network and device rollout. For example, in the U.S. there are at least two different types of 5G networks at the moment, with many confusing elements about the technology. The sub-6-gigahertz 5G and the millimeter-wave versions of the technology operate on different frequencies of the radio spectrum. Millimeter-wave 5G offers greater benefits in terms of data speeds and improvements in lag times, but there are technological limitations that make it hard for U.S. carriers to deploy it broadly. Sub-6 performs much more slowly but can travel a much further distance, said Bob O'Donnell, president of Technalysis Research. In addition, millimeter wave doesn't go through buildings or trees or it doesn't work indoors for the most part. The telecom carriers are also each embracing different spectrums, so some equipment will work on some networks but not on others. Different electronics and hardware makers are supplying products for different spectrums of the network. That why you hear so many conflicting stories, he said. U.S. wireless carriers are in the midst of national rollouts of the new wireless standard, but consumers are unlikely to experience the faster millimeter-wave 5G in much of their daily lives, at least at the outset. Wireless companies have talked about how millimeter-wave 5G is now present in many stadiums, for example, though the everyday 5G experience will mostly be centered on sub-6 technology, which offers more limited benefits over today's 4G connectivity but works better indoors. Unfortunately, the average consumer needs to learn more about this to know what to buy and what not to buy, O'Donnell said. Devices enabled with 5G capabilities are being introduced, but are expensive. In January, market researcher IDC attributed the 1.1% drop in fourth-quarter global smartphone shipments to the Chinese market to consumers waiting for less-expensive 5G phones and better network coverage. Don't miss: Samsung jacks up prices for its Galaxy smartphones with 5G capabilities The lackluster earnings reports this quarter from Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.36% and AT&T Inc. T, -0.94% T, -0.94% reminded investors of what a long haul the upgrade to 5G is going to be, with analysts noting that the 5G upgrade cycle hasn't even started yet. The handset guys seem to be building the phones, I don't know how much of a network there will be to use, said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst who follows semiconductors. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, -0.31% launched a new smartphone that is designed to run on both of the different 5G spectrums in the U.S., but coronavirus could upset the supply chain needed to manufacture new phones. Rival Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.59% is expected to launch its first 5G-enabled iPhones later this year, but as the largest U.S. tech company admits, the coronavirus is already affecting its business, and it is hard to predict what future effects could be. Read: How the coronavirus is affecting companies and their tech conference plans When this much confusion exists about large changes in technology, the big players typically can get together and figure out their issues, but coronavirus may get in the way of that too. Barcelona's Mobile World Congress, the biggest annual mobile-focused trade show, was canceled earlier this month due to coronavirus fears. The move will lead to more delays of new product rollouts, especially in the handset area, and other related electronics. Intel Corp. INTC, -1.35% had been expected to launch new chips for 5G networks on the eve of the show, and that will have to be rescheduled. The products which were supposed to be launched in a week's time will be launched at a different date ” OEMs will have to make plans on that, said Gerrit Schneemann, senior analyst at Informa.  Even if they can announce phones quickly, a disrupted supply chain means that they might not be able to actually ship any phones right away. Take a network rollout that is already problematic, add issues of constraints and slowdowns in key manufacturing regions in China, toss in questions about consumer demand for costly devices, and it's not a good recipe for a new technology. While there are greater things to worry about amid a potential global pandemic, those who have staked their livelihoods or investments on the 5G rollout have a lot to fear right now.

The world's largest company by revenue expects to save $60 million annually on plastic shopping bags, just by changing our buying process and better utilizing our scale, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said. The remarks were made after the retail giant announced its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The earnings announcement also fell on the same day as the company's investment community event. Biggs also said the company is saving 15% on the cost of vests worn by sales staff, which are made with recyclable materials. Biggs said the vests are more comfortable and more sustainable. See: Walmart to shut down Jetblack shopping service This isn't the first time Walmart WMT, +2.04% has announced savings from a random corner of the business. Back in October 2018, the company said it would save $20 million annually by switching to a new floor wax that was cheaper and made it possible to buff the floors fewer times. While Walmart is anticipating big savings on shopping bags and associate uniforms, the impact of the coronavirus is still to be determined. Read: Apple's coronavirus warnings wasn't a total surprise but magnitude rattles Wall Street Biggs said the company anticipates a couple of cents negative impact in the first quarter from the coronavirus outbreak. The impact of the outbreak wasn't included in Walmart's fiscal 2021 outlook. Walmart is guiding for earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.15, up 1.5% to 4.5% from fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS, e-commerce growth of around 30% and Walmart U.S. same-store sales growth of at least 2.5%, excluding fuel. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $5.21 and domestic same-store sales growth of 3%. Also: E-commerce surge sparks questions about reliability of same-store sales metric Fourth-quarter earnings and revenue fell short , which Chief Executive Doug McMillon attributed to a variety of factors, including the shortened holiday shopping season, the shift to e-commerce and the lack of a hot toy. Walmart raised its dividend by 2%. Walmart's Q4 performance, which we characterize as tepid overall, indicates that the holiday season was if anything even more promotional than we anticipated, with its U.S. operating margin down around 75 basis points for the quarter, some of which was due to mix as lower margin food sales were strong while higher margin apparel was weak, some due to softness in key holiday categories such as toys, and some due to increased expenses around delivery, said Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead Walmart analyst. GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders notes that the holiday challenges at Walmart weren't unique to that retailer. Target Corp. TGT, +0.83% , for instance, talked about the bigger-than-expected challenges of the shortened holiday season. However, Walmart saw some cannibalization from its e-commerce business, which grew 35% in the fourth quarter, with customers opting for a digital purchase rather than going to stores, Saunders said. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.87% didn't help either. Competition from Amazon heated up across multiple categories as its spending initiatives further heightened promotional activity as it drove sales above management's forecast, though in doing so it sacrificed' around 150 basis points of margin for the quarter, Moody's O'Shea said. What also hurt was unrest in Chile, with Biggs saying that some stores in that country were destroyed during political protests. The business there is not expected to recover in the coming fiscal year. Disruption in Chile coupled with a legal matter cost 5 cents per share in the fourth quarter. Chile hurt operating income by about $110 million. Don't miss: Coronavirus could drive up out-of-stocks at stores by April: Wells Fargo Overall, we think Walmart likely wasn't immune from some of the near-term pressures like a shortened holiday season that impacted competitors such as Target during the holiday season, wrote UBS analysts led by Michael Lasser. Still its early guidance leads us to believe that its current year-to-date performance in February has been strong and it's well positioned to take further share. UBS rates Walmart stock neutral with a $125 price target. Walmart stock is up 18.4% over the last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% has gained 13% for the period.",business
"Valentina Za, Riccardo Bastianello",2/22/2020,reuters,"UPDATE 5-Two dead, 79 infected in Italy as govt fights to contains coronavirus outbreak",https://www.reuters.com/article/china-health-italy/update-5-two-dead-79-infected-in-italy-as-govt-fights-to-contains-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSL5N2AM076," By Valentina Za and Riccardo Bastianello MILAN, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Cases of the new coronavirus in Italy, the most affected country in Europe, rose on Saturday to nearly 80, killing two people and prompting the government to close off the worst hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Authorities in the two regions, where the outbreak is concentrated, have cancelled sports events, including three top league soccer games, and closed schools and universities. Companies from Ray-Ban owner Luxottica to the country's top bank UniCredit have told workers living in the affected areas to stay home. Lombardy and Veneto represent Italy's industrial heart and jointly account for 30% of gross domestic output. With an emergency decree passed at a meeting in the headquarters of Italy's civil protection agency, the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. Competent ministers will also be able to halt sports events and school trips outside those areas. I've wondered myself why so many cases in Italy ... and the answer is in the rigorous and meticulous controls our country has adopted from the start, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at a late night press conference. Italy's first victim was a 76-year-old woman who was found dead at her home 50 km (30 miles) south of Milan on Thursday and tested positive for the coronavirus. A 78-year-old man died of the infection in a hospital near Padua on Friday night. The man's wife and daughter are among 17 people infected by the coronavirus in the Veneto region, where authorities are considering suspending Carnival of Venice events currently taking place. There are 54 cases in nearby Lombardy, including a man currently at San Raffaele hospital in Milan. The city, where Women's Fashion Week is underway, has a population of 1.4 million. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani said his fashion show on Sunday would take place in an empty theatre without any press or buyers present to safeguard their health. Milan's prosecutors office said it would not reopen on Monday and remain closed until further notice. Organisers of the world's biggest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, on Saturday postponed to the end of May the event which had been due to take place in Milan in a week. The outbreak originated in Codogno, a small town southeast of Milan where Lombardy's first infected patient, a 38-year-old man now in stable condition, was treated. All those who have tested positive are people who on Feb. 18-19 had contacts with the emergency room and the hospital of Codogno, Regional Health Councillor Giulio Gallera said, adding 259 people had been screened in the area in the past two days and 35 had tested positive. A contagion rate of 13% is quite strong, he said. Some 50,000 residents in Codogno and nine nearby towns have been advised to remain indoors. Public gatherings including Sunday church services and football matches have been suspended, and schools and shops have been closed. Similar measures were adopted in the small Veneto town of Vo' Euganeo where the male victim lived, and in other places. Conte said further school shutdowns outside the outbreak epicentre would be up to local authorities. Italy was the first euro zone country to suspend all direct flights to and from China, after two Chinese tourists from the badly hit city of Wuhan tested positive in Rome in late January. The Chinese tourists and an Italian national repatriated from Wuhan were the only three cases in Italy until Friday.

A 77-year-old woman who was found dead at her house 50 km south of Milan on Thursday has tested positive for the coronavirus, a local councillor said on Saturday, after a 78-year-old man died of the infection near Padua overnight. The man's wife and daughter are among 12 people infected by the coronavirus in the Veneto region. Italy is the worst affected country in Europe, with the bulk of cases concentrated in Lombardy, the country's financial and industrial heart. Regional Welfare Councillor Giulio Gallera told reporters the center of the outbreak was Codogno, a small town southwest of Milan where Lombardy's first infected patient was treated. That patient was a 38-year-old man, who fell ill after meeting a friend who had visited China. His condition has stabilized, authorities said. All those who have tested positive are people who on February 18-19 had contacts with the emergency room and the hospital of Codogno, Gallera said, adding 259 people had been screened in the area in the past two days and 35 had tested positive.

Regional Governor Luca Zaia said the administration was considering whether to suspend Carnival of Venice events. There are no confirmed cases in Milan so far, Gallera said. On Saturday the board of MIDO said the coronavirus emergency had prompted it to postpone to the end of May the world's biggest eyewear trade fair due to take place in Milan in a week.

What investors need to know,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-stock-market-investors-arent-freaking-out-over-the-rising-us-dollar-just-yet-2020-02-19?mod=article_inline,"Here's a market conundrum: A surging dollar doesn't appear to be putting the brakes on an equity rally that's pushed major U.S. indexes to all-time highs despite some periodic volatility tied to worries about China's COVID-19 epidemic. A rapidly strengthening U.S. dollar can be a source of discomfort for stock-market investors for a few reasons. Most obviously, a stronger currency can make U.S. exporters less competitive overseas and dent overseas earnings for U.S.-based multinationals. Read: Here's a reminder that when the dollar moves, things break' ” and vice versa Beyond earnings, a stronger dollar also represents a de facto tightening of monetary policy, noted Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager at BlackRock, in emailed comments. If not offset by other factors, this can lead to a broader tightening of financial conditions, which in turn can result in multiple compression and heightened volatility. Tighter financial conditions are also likely to negatively impact other risky assets, notably emerging markets, he said. Multiple compression occurs when a company's earnings rise but its stock price stays the same or falls, reducing the price-to-earnings ratio. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.00% , a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.1% to 99.577 after hitting an intraday high at 99.72, according to FactSet, taking out its early October high to trade at its strongest since May 2017. For the year to date, the index is up 3.4%, so far defying consensus expectations for a 2020 decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% rose 115.84 points, or 0.4%, on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% rallied 15.86 points or 0.6%, to close at a record . The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.79% also logged a record finish, rising 84.44 points, or 0.9%. Need to Know: Mania has taken hold in the equity market and there is no respect' for risk: strategist So why are stock-market bulls looking past the dollar rally? A stronger U.S. currency eventually could present a headwind to stocks, but it would likely take a further run-up, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, in a phone interview. Also read: Tesla, gold and the dollar soar ” an everything rally has some investors fearing how it all ends Of course, it isn't so simple to determine what magnitude of dollar rally would put a dent in stock-market sentiment, Sonders said, but she noted that a more recent episode of dollar-related equity weakness came after a much sharper currency rally. In 2014-2015, the dollar index jump around 27% in around 10 months, with the gauge further extending gains in 2016. Stocks sold off as the dollar rally took a toll on earnings, particularly in the energy sector, where a rising dollar also contributed to weakness in oil prices, Sonders noted. The current rally is more subdued. The index has rallied around 12% off its February 2018 low to its present level. Koesterich noted that the dollar index also saw a bigger jump in mid-2018, when it rallied by over 8%. Stocks tumbled sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018 before rebounding sharply last year. Moreover, the dollar index''s rise still hasn't taken it far outside the range that's prevailed over the last 18 months or so. This suggests that it will arguably take a more dramatic rise in the dollar to impact equity markets, he said. The dollar and equity gains have also accompanied gains by traditional haven assets, including gold and Treasurys. Indeed, gold futures US:GCJ20 were up 0.3% on Wednesday and have rallied 5.7% so far this year. A stronger dollar is often seen as a negative for gold and other dollar-priced commodities, making them more expensive to users of other currencies. Some market watchers, meanwhile, argued against the notion that the dollar itself is benefiting from haven-related buying around China's COVID-19 outbreak. In a Tuesday note, analysts at RBC observed that rather than rallying when equities and other such risky assets come under pressure, the dollar is showing a more positive correlation with the stock market than at any other time in the past two years. Moreover, the dollar's overall price action is actually at odds with other more traditional havens, such as gold and Treasurys, which have both gave back some of the ground attributed to flight-to-safety buying, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS, in a note. The most plausible explanation for ongoing dollar strength is that investors globally want to own U.S. assets because they have the highest confidence in the U.S. economy doing fine, which is more of a flight-to-conviction, not safety, Draho said.",business
William Watts,2/22/2020,marketwatch,"U.S. stocks slump, ending two week win streak, led by tech sector as coronavirus worries ratchet higher",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-futures-headed-lower-early-friday-as-coronavirus-hits-japan-coca-cola-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"U.S. stocks slumped  Friday, ending a two week win streak,  as the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic from China to neighboring countries amplified worries about the impact on supply chains and global economic growth. Tech shares were the biggest loser in the S&P 500 index, with the sector closing down 2% as investors weighed potential fallout resulting from the corornavirus. How did benchmarks fare? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.43% closed below 29,000, shedding 227.51 points, or 0.8%, at 28,992.40, its worst one-day percentage drop since Feb. 7. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.04% lost 35.48 points, or 1.1%, to settle at 3,337.75, its biggest one-day percentage decline since Jan. 31. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.66% lost 174.37 points, or 1.8%, to finish at 9,576.59, its worst single-day percentage fall since Jan. 27, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the week, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.6%, while the Dow fell 1.4% and the S&P 500 shed 1.3%, snapping a two-week win streak for each benchmark. What drove the market? Shares of Microsoft Corp . MSFT, -0.30% , Apple Inc . AAPL, +0.24% and Intel Corp . INTC, +1.90% weighed on the Dow, as investors grew increasingly wary about potential fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. Stocks also came under pressure after IHS Markit said business in the U.S. contracted in February for the first time in four years owing to disruptions caused by the coronavirus and growing angst over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.  The forecasting firm said its activity indexes for both manufacturers and service-oriented firms declined this month. And the service sector index turned negative for the first time since 2015. In a big surprise, the index covering the large service side of the economy sank 4 points to 49.4, IHS Markit said Friday. A reading of less than 50 indicates a contraction in activity. The spread of the virus inside and outside of China has been unsettling the market lately, likely contributing to gains in havens like government bonds and gold, with investors showing reluctance to hold on to equities heading into the weekend. The coronavirus outbreak contains a significant likelihood of impact to the global economy and the potential to become a black-swan type event, warned Bank of America Global Research rates strategist Bruno Braizinha, in a client note Friday. The uncertainty has been reflected in the market and has naturally led to an increase in recession probabilities. Read : Fed's Brainard backs deploying untested monetary-policy plan in next recession Economists at Standard Chartered Bank on Friday estimated that COVID-19 epidemic could affect 30% of China's imports and 10% of its exports, prompting them to lower their gross domestic product forecast for China this year to 5.5% from 5.8%. South Korea has reported 48 more cases, bring its total infections from the novel coronavirus to 204, and in Japan, officials from Tokyo and Osaka said they wouldn't hold large events such as school graduation ceremonies and entrance examinations for three weeks through mid-March, in an effort to contain the viral outbreak, The Wall Street Journal reported . Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said Friday that there are 76,767 confirmed cases of the illness and 2,247 deaths, marking another day in which the number of new cases world-wide has slowed. The full economic impact of the disease is unclear but early indications suggest that it is already denting China's car sales. Chinese passenger car sales data for the first two weeks of February showed a year-over-year decline of 92%, Bloomberg News reported . And in the first 16 days of the month, only about 5,000 passenger cars were sold compared with nearly 60,000 in the same period of last year, the data showed. Nobody has a really good handle on just what the impact is on supply chains, Luke Tilley, chief economist of Wilmington Trust, told MarketWatch. Individual companies can identify their supply chains, but they aren't as easily capable of identifying the next links down the chain. That makes it hard to peg the overall impact, he said. It's understandable that some investors are moving to a risk-off mode. Separately, Coca-Cola KO, +2.82% said it estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter, citing coronavirus . China ranks as the third-largest market in the world in terms of unit case volume. Shares gained 0.4%. In other economic data, U.S. existing home sales fell 1.3% in January to a 5.46 million annual rate. Which stocks were in focus? Deere & Co .

US:S Shake Shack SHAK, +0.06% shares fell 2.4% after the burger chain was downgraded by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey on guidance fears. Shares of Dropbox Inc . DBX, -1.29% surged 20% Friday, after one analyst called the cloud-storage company's quarterly earnings and forward-looking commentary  potentially thesis-changing . Ebay Inc . EBAY, +0.08% shares rose 1.4% Friday , following a Wall Street Journal report said there could potentially be a sale of the e-commerce company's classified ad business, which operates mostly outside of the U.S. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc . AMD, -2.40% fell almost 7% Friday, even though credit-rating agency S&P Global upgraded the semiconductor company one notch to BB from BB-, citing progress by the company in reducing its debt load. Shares closed at a record Wednesday. National CineMedia Inc . NCMI, +2.74% share soared 17.1% Friday , after the company posted net income that beat consensus and voted to increase its quarterly cash dividend. Wells Fargo & Co . WFC, +5.94% shares gained 1.5% after the bank paid $3 billion to settled a probe into the creation of fake-accounts to boost profits, which was brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice. How did other assets perform? The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery US:CLJ20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 50 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $53.38 a barrel, amid fears that cracks may be forming in the Saudi Arabia and Russia alliance over how far to cut oil production.

The novel coronavirus that emerged late last year has already claimed three times more lives than the SARS outbreak in 2003, and it is still spreading. More than 50 million people (more than the combined metro populations of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco) remain under historically unprecedented lockdown, unable to leave their city”and in many cases, even their apartment. Many countries no longer accept visiting Chinese nationals, or if they do, quarantine them for weeks. Big companies are pulling out of trade shows. Production is suffering. Profound economic consequences are bound to ensue, not just in China but around the world. How did Xi Jinping”the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, who has been consolidating his power since taking over the post in 2012”let things get to this point? It might be that he didn't fully know what was happening in his own country until it was too late. Xi would be far from the first authoritarian to have been blindsided. Ironically, for all the talk of the technological side of Chinese authoritarianism, China's use of technology to ratchet up surveillance and censorship may have made things worse, by making it less likely that Xi would even know what was going on in his own country.",general
Adam Chapman,2/21/2020,express,"Type 2 diabetes: Pumpernickel bread, greek yoghurt and oats could lower blood sugar",https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1245082/type-2-diabetes-symptoms-diet-pumpernickel-bread-greek-yoghurt-oats-lower-blood-sugar," Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Your blood sugar level is the concentration of glucose found in your blood, a sugar that you get from food and drink. Without insulin control, blood sugar levels continue to rise, and, over time, this increases your risk of developing serious complications, such as heart disease. To compensate for this faulty mechanism, you must eat certain food and drink and shun others to stop blood sugar levels from soaring. Before you choose specific items, there are some general dietary rules to follow. According to Rob Hobson, registered nutritionist and nutritionist at Healthspan, the best foods to help manage and maintain healthy blood glucose levels are those that are high in fibre, protein and healthy fats. These foods take time to be digested and have little impact on blood sugar levels, he explains. The glycaemic index is often used as a handy guide to differentiate between foods that have a marked impact on blood sugar levels and those that have a modest effect, notes Hobson. READ MORE: How to live longer: People with this condition 50 percent more likely to die early  You should choose low and medium GI foods to help manage blood glucose levels, he says. These types of foods are also useful to combine with carbohydrates at mealtimes as they slow down the release of glucose into the bloodstream, he says. Once you have wrapped your head around your general approach, you should opt for blood-sugar friendly snacks to keep your blood sugar levels within healthy range throughout the day. Hobson recommends these three foods which can be enjoyed at breakfast - in fact, any time of the day: DON'T MISSCancer symptoms: Sweating at night could be a warning sign of this type of cancer [INSIGHT]Coronavirus named: What does COVID-19 stand for? Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]How to get rid of visceral fat: Why this popular food may reduce the dangerous belly fat [TIPS]  This type of bread is very high in fibre and has a low GI score, notes Hobson. The addition of nut butter adds healthy fats and protein which will slow down the release of sugar from the banana, he says. Supporting the benefits, one study published in the journal Review of Diabetic Studies found that spelt and rye caused low initial glycaemic responses and that they may suppress certain genes that promote glucose metabolism. Most whole fruits except melon and pineapple have a low GI because of the fibre they contain although GI does increase as they ripen, explains Hobson.  He continues: Yoghurt is high in protein and fat (depending on what type you choose) and if you choose natural varieties is low in sugar. Bolstering the claim, a large study published in the British Medical Journal found that people who ate whole fruits and especially berries and apples had a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Notably, a higher consumption of fruit juice was shown to be associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Hobson says: Oats have a low GI score and are widely understood to help manage blood glucose levels as they are high in fibre and broken down slowly in the gut.  Oats also contain beta glucans which may also help to improve insulin sensitivity which is very beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes, he says. Evidence attests to the benefits. A large review of 16 studies published in the journal Nutrients showed that oats had a beneficial effect on glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes. Many people have type 2 diabetes without realising because symptoms do not necessarily make you feel unwell. However, symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include: See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
"Agence France-Presse, APA Media",2/21/2020,theguardian,Coronavirus: flight evacuating Britons from stricken cruise ship leaves Japan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/brits-coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-to-fly-home,"The British government has begun repatriating its citizens trapped on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan for more than two weeks. The evacuation flight from Japan has now departed with 32 British and European passengers on board, as well as British government and medical staff, the Foreign Office said in a statement on Saturday. The plane was expected to land at Boscombe Down military base in southern England on Saturday morning UK time, it said. Passengers would then be placed in a further 14-day quarantine. The Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined off Tokyo on 5 February when a passenger who left in Hong Kong was found infected with the virus. The repatriation flight came after earlier being delayed. More than 70 British nationals onboard, who had been confined to cabins except for brief trips on deck wearing masks and gloves, had been due to fly home on Friday. The Diamond Princess was carrying more than 3,700 people in early February when 10 passengers were diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain of the disease. Since it has been quarantined in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China. The four Britons onboard the Diamond Princess who have tested positive will not be on the flight. David and Sally Abel from Northamptonshire have been documenting their time on the quarantined ship on Facebook. The couple are now being treated in a Japanese hospital after days shut in their cabin following their diagnosis. David Abel admitted he was initially sceptical about whether his diagnosis was accurate, but since confirmed both he and his wife had tested positive. In his latest post, he said: Full health inspection and now we know what's going on. We both contracted a cold (unaware of) and it has not yet turned into pneumonia. (We do have coronavirus.) Tomorrow the big tests commence. Chest X-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine and more. He said that after treatment, the couple would need three rounds of all-clears on coronavirus tests. He said: Wifi will not work for me, so this will be the final communication for some time. See you all before you know it. Meanwhile, Britons in Cambodia who left another cruise ship, the Westerdam, and who have been cleared for travel, are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. The group are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings. All have tested negative after one case was diagnosed on board. The number of Britons in the group has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether some have already come back to the UK. Public Health England said airport health teams would meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms. If they do not have symptoms, passengers will be given health advice and told to self-isolate at home for 14 days but, if they have symptoms, they will be taken to hospital for testing. As of 2pm on Thursday, a total of 5,549 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, of whom nine have tested positive. There have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and about 1,070 cases in 26 other countries “ including those on the Diamond Princess. Authorities in China recorded 118 deaths on Thursday, bringing the total to 2,236 inside the country. In the World Health Organization briefing on Thursday, the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: You will get sick of me saying that the window of opportunity remains open for us to contain this Covid-19 outbreak. WHO is doing everything we can to seize that window of opportunity, and we urge the international community to do the same. He said the data continued to show a decline in new cases but that this was no time for complacency.",general
Aimee Robinson,2/21/2020,express,British Airways: Airline extends China flight cancellations amid coronavirus epidemic,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1245720/British-airways-flights-china-coronavirus-cancelled," As coronavirus rages on British Airways has announced it will be cancelling all flights right up until mid-April. The news comes as the infection rate for the deadly virus surpasses 77,000. Meanwhile, 2,250 have lost their lives. The British carrier initially cancelled services until the end of March, following suit of many other global airlines who also withdrew services to the virus epicentre. However, this morning BA updated its travel advice section to say that it is extending flight cancellations to the Chinese cities of being and Shanghai following guidance from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. A statement posted on the website reads: Following the Foreign Office's continued advice against all but essential travel to mainland China, we have cancelled our flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until 19 April 2020. This situation will remain under review and we will continue to provide regular updates. If you have a booking with us, please make sure we have your contact details. We'll do everything we can to help customers affected. READ MORE: Coronavirus spread: How to avoid coronavirus on flights   BA will be contacting affected customers within the next 24 hours. The airline is still operating flights to Hong Kong, though on a reduced schedule. It has temporarily suspended one of its two daily flights to the region until March 31 due to a decrease in demand. The BA's website states: If you are flying to/from Hong Kong up until 31 May 2020, you can rebook on to another flight operated by British Airways to the same destination at a later date, or request a refund. DON'T MISSPound to euro exchange rate: Sterling struggles' [GRAPH]WATCH: Plane passenger couple divide with very unusual move [VIDEO]Google Maps: Whale-like creature spotted in garden pond [PICS] Earlier this month airlines at least 73 other global airlines withdrew flights from China in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. Amongst them were Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada, Air Asia, Air France, Air India, Air New Zealand, Lufthansa, American Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Despite the concern, the World Health Organisation says travellers should not avoid airports if they need to travel. Appearing on a Coronavirus update video, Dr Carmen Dolea, Head, IHR Secretariat at the World Health Organisation said that proper hand hygiene is the key to protecting against the virus. If you have to travel you have to go to the airport, she says. If you want to reduce your risk of being infected it's true that staying away from people which may be suspected cases may help you to reduce your risk.  Being on travel in a hotel room is similarly an issue of practising personal protection measures, she said. So, you should be careful to wash the hands properly, to use alcohol-based hand rub, make sure that the food hygiene practises are also taken into account. Dr Dolea adds: There is no specific requirement for being in a hotel than being in any other place while being a traveller. Similar protection for regular people or regular travellers have to be taken as if for any other type of respiratory infection. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports the advice given by the World Health Organisation, similarly stressing the importance of hand hygiene. The CDC adds: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Some travellers have taken to wearing masks to the airport, although they may not be as preventive as one might imagine. Dr Dolea points out that they won't necessarily protect you from picking up coronavirus. She says: The masks are very effective for protecting people that are sick, for preventing them to transmit the virus onward. For people that are not sick masks are not very effective. It is almost important to ensure that you are using the masks properly and make sure not to touch the exterior of the mask even if you are not sick. The masks are also important for people that are caring for sick people. It will be important that people who most need the masks have access. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
Al Root,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Stocks Drop on the Week But Still Look Bubbly. Prepare for a Correction.,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-drop-on-the-week-but-still-look-bubbly-prepare-for-a-correction-51582334151,"Photograph by Spencer Platt/Getty Images A stock-market meltup is happening right under our noses. And though we don't quite have a definite sign that a bubble in equities is forming, several market statistics are concerning. They suggest it might be best to prepare for a post-bubble correction of 10% or more. On the surface, things look calm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.4% this past week, snapping two weeks of solid gains. The benchmark is up 1.9% for the year. The S&P 500 index dropped 1.2% for the week and is up 3.6% for the year. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6% on the week and is up 6.9% year to date. None of those numbers point to a bubble. It is what's going on under the surface that looks worrisome. Growth stocks are dominating value stocks, blowing past dot-com-era outperformance levels. The last time we got to these levels, the bubble burst and a 50%-plus global bear market began, Citigroup strategist Robert Buckland pointed out in a Friday research report. Consider the trading action in the market's most popular stocks. The FAANGs” Facebook (ticker: FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)”are up 10% year to date, adding more than $330 billion in market value to the S&P 500. What's more, the average price/earnings ratio for FAANG stocks has jumped to 35 times estimated earnings from 21 times last year. Microsoft (MSFT)”an honorary FAANG member, with its $1.4 trillion market capitalization”is also something to behold. Shares are up 14% in 2020 and 65% over the past year, and now trade for 31 times estimated earnings. The last time the stock reached today's valuation levels was in 2002, soon after the dot-com bubble burst. It isn't just rising valuations that should concern investors. There's the options market , too. Microsoft's bullish call-option volume, for instance, is blowing away bearish put-option volume, with the ratio up about 60% year over year. That's significant because, as one colorful trader told Barron's, screen monkeys lifting quotes helps fuel market froth. Total trading in all options for the FAANG-plus-Microsoft group is also up about 60% year over year”and traders are buying more calls than usual. The action is undeniably bullish. It is possibly euphoric. The options-trading action is the closest thing to a smoking gun out there. What to do? Sell stocks as they rise”or learn to trade the momentum? At some point, value stocks will outperform growth stocks. The problem is investors who followed that path have underperformed for years. There are, after all, a lot of energy stocks”which have been slammed by low oil prices”in the value indexes. What about home-builder stocks? The group still trades at a modest price/earnings ratio, and recent U.S. housing data have been solid . The sector is up year to date, but the options market isn't pointing to a bubble in housing stocks. Besides sector rotation, one could sell down portfolio exposure”taking some money off the table. That can be painful, but prudent. We aren't calling the end of the bull market in U.S. stocks. Yet. But the market is overbought , in Wall Street parlance. That means bullish sentiment is high and a correction is due. A 10% drop to 3000 in the S&P 500”near the index's 200-day moving average”wouldn't surprise seasoned traders. In fact, the market is as far away from its 200-day moving average as it has been since late 2017. (That was followed by”wait for it”a correction.) Bull markets don't die of old age, as they say on the Street. Something has to happen to derail global growth. It could be the coronavirus outbreak in China. It could be slowing commercial construction activity in the U. S.”something Deere (DE) hinted at during its conference call on Friday. Investors ignored Deere's warning and sent its shares up 7% in trading on Friday. Deere left its full-year earnings guidance unchanged. That's another sign of a stock market bubble: ignoring bad news. Read more The Trader : Retailers Start Reporting Earnings This Week. What To Watch For.

Photograph by Michael Nagle/Bloomberg The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped again on Friday”and yields on long-term Treasury debt fell to record lows”but investors can't simply blame the coronavirus outbreak in China this time. It's the U.S. economy that's vexing investors. A key U.S. economic indicator registered its weakest reading since 2013. The Markit Services PMI , or purchasing manager index, came in under 50”the level that divides growth from contraction. Economists were looking for 53.4. It came in at 49.4, a big miss. It was the lowest reading in 76 months. Services make up more than two-thirds of total U.S. economic activity. Economists are always closely watching the state of the U.S. consumer to gauge the economic health of the country. Read Next: Inside Berkshire Hathaway's Future Without Warren Buffett It's the first service PMI reading below 50 going all the way back to 2017, the earliest months Barron's could review. The Markit manufacturing PMI was also released Friday morning. It too registered a lower-than-expected level, coming in at 50.8 versus 51.5. The composite economic PMI”including service and manufacturing”registered below 50 for the first time since 2013. Friday's data indicate the U.S. economy is slowing down. The numbers could be weak because of the virus, due to weak energy markets, or both. What is clear is that investors didn't like the news. Only seven stocks in the Dow were up in midafternoon, while the overall index was down 245 points, or about 0.8%, recovering from an earlier loss of more than 300 points. Twenty-three stocks were in the red. Microsoft (ticker: MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) are the weakest performers, dropping 3.6%, 2.8%, and 2.5%, respectively. Boeing (BA) was the largest decliner by points, until midday, accounting for about 31 points of the drop. Don't forget that the Dow is a price-weighted index, which means that Boeing has a bigger weighting than Microsoft. The commercial-aerospace giant's stock price is about $331 a share. Microsoft stock, with its huge $1.4 trillion market value, trades at about $180. Microsoft has far more shares outstanding than Boeing. If the Dow closes in the red, it would be the fifth loss in six trading sessions for the index. The Nasdaq Composite, full of the technology companies that have led stocks' rally, was down 2%. Haven assets, on the other hand, took off. Gold prices gained 1.5% and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miner ETF (GDX) has risen 3.4%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 1.89% on Friday morning, dropping below the prior record low of 1.9% set in August of 2019. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell below the three-month yield. That pricing anomaly is typically known as a yield curve inversion, and is considered to be a recession indicator if it persists long enough. There wasn't a clear consensus over how long or severe any global economic impact from the coronavirus would be, however. Global economic data over the coming months is likely to reflect a slowdown, wrote TD Securities rate strategists in a Friday note. ” Alexandra Scaggs contributed to this article.

"Alaa Elassar, CNN",2/21/2020,cnn,A group of college students may face disciplinary action over a coronavirus-themed party,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/us/university-of-albany-coronavirus-themed-party-trnd/index.html," Some students at a New York university are in hot water over allegations they held what the school is describing as a ""coronavirus-themed party."" Officials at the University of Albany say they are investigating the event, which they called ""distasteful and hurtful"" in a news release. ""We are aware of a coronavirus-themed party that was recently held off-campus and not sanctioned by the University at Albany,"" the University of Albany said in a statement. ""The theme of this party was distasteful and hurtful and is not representative of UAlbany or its nearly 18,000 students."" The trouble started last week when a video was posted on Instagram showing a bucket filled with ice and beer and a University of Albany student wearing a surgical mask, Albany's WGY News Radio reported. The video, which has since been deleted, was captioned, ""Corona virus isn't gonna stop anyone from partying."" Read More CNN did not independently view the video. Students who violate the university's Student Code of Conduct may face disciplinary actions, the school said, even if the party was not on school premises. The university did not respond to questions regarding when the party was held, how many students were involved and what kind of disciplinary action the students could possibly face. A beer joke or xenophobia? The Asian American Alliance at the University at Albany issued a statement on Instagram on Monday demanding an apology. ""As members of the Asian community on campus, your party is not funny and completely insensitive,"" the Asian American Alliance said in their statement. ""The real life affects of this virus has led to not only mass stereotyping of Asian people, but also hundreds of deaths across the world."" View this post on Instagram If you would like to help bring justice, please email the Dean of Students (dos@albany.edu) & the Vice President of student affairs (Mike Christakis) to let them know that this isn't okay with us! UAlbany does not stand for this kind of racism π’›π’ #EndStereotypes #inclusivity #NoToHate A post shared by π”Έπ•¤π•π•’π• π”Έπ•π•–π•£π•π•”π•’π• π”Έπ•π•π•π•’π•π•”π•– (@asianamericanalliance) on Feb 17, 2020 at 11:42am PST The alliance requested that the school investigate the ""illegal student group,"" and require the students involved to issue an apology on their Instagram page. It wasn't clear what they meant by calling the group illegal. ""Diseases that affect non-white populations are radicalized in a way that stems from the innate xenophobia of American society. It serves to dehumanize the affected population. This has happened with ebola and has shown its face again with the coronavirus,"" the alliance said. The Hubei health authority in China reported that 115 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei province on Thursday, raising the death toll in the epicenter since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak to 2,144. But the death toll is not the only tragic consequence of the outbreak. Rampant ignorance and misinformation about the novel coronavirus, experts say, has led to racist and xenophobic attacks against fellow Americans or anyone in the US who looks East Asian.

Alexandra Harney,2/21/2020,reuters,Virus shows plight of China's overstretched doctors,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-healthcare/virus-shows-plight-of-chinas-overstretched-doctors-idUKKBN20F0ZC,"The coronavirus epidemic has shined a spotlight on another simmering crisis in China's healthcare system: a critical shortage of doctors. Rising demand for health care has far outpaced the increase in the supply of doctors. Between 2005 and 2018, the number of fully licensed doctors nearly doubled, but the number of hospital admissions nearly quadrupled, according to Chinese government data. The result is a vicious cycle, doctors and industry consultants say. There are less doctors to see more patients, and the patients are frustrated that they don't get more time with doctors, and they take that out on the doctors, and those doctors go home and tell their kids never to become a doctor, said Scott Rein, founding principal of China Healthcare Advisory Group, a Shanghai-based consultancy that advises hospital operators, investors and physicians' groups. Chinese doctors face unusual risks. Verbal and physical assaults are common. Nearly two-thirds of Chinese doctors have been involved in disputes, according to the Chinese Medical Doctor Association, an industry group. In December, a man killed a doctor at a Beijing hospital after a disagreement over his mother's care. Every doctor has experienced some kind of abuse, said He Jiye, an orthopaedic surgeon in Shanghai. Although China has public and private medical care, most top doctors are at public hospitals, which attract the most patients. Jane Xiao, a paediatrician in Xiamen, in southeast China, said that one doctor might see more than 100 children for physicals in one morning at the hospital where she works. The government has tried to relieve pressure on public hospitals by promoting community hospitals and allowing public system doctors to also work at private clinics. But some public hospitals threaten to fire those who moonlight elsewhere, one doctor said. Pay is another issue. Only 8.1 percent of medical workers are happy with their wages, according to a 2018 survey by DXY, a Chinese online platform for healthcare information. Many students who study medicine do not go on to practice it, doctors say. Better pay and working conditions at pharmaceutical companies, among other professions, lure medical students and professionals, doctors say. The Feb. 7 death of Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who was among the first to call attention to the coronavirus, and the death of the director of a Wuhan hospital this week have called attention to the risks those treating the disease face. More than 1,700 medical staff have been infected and six have died, the National Health Commission said last week. In recent weeks, Chinese state news agencies and images on social media have depicted the exhausting conditions that engulf doctors battling the epidemic. But doctors told Reuters they doubted the crisis would lead to a long-term improvement in their reputation. A Feb. 14 post on Weibo, the Twitter-like social media platform, read: This epidemic has shown how lacking in resources our medical system is. And with all the evil attacks on doctors in recent years, there will definitely be fewer people willing to study medicine. Reporting By Alexandra Harney.

The global beverage giant is forecasting that the virus will hit its quarterly earnings by 1 cent to 2 cents, unit case volume by 2% to 3% and organic revenue by 1% to 2%. Despite the hit to its first-quarter financial results, the company still expects to meet its full-year targets. Coke estimates 2020 organic revenue will grow by 5% and adjusted earnings per share will increase by 7% to $2.25. In 2019, the company reported net sales of $37.3 billion and earnings per share of $2.07. Shares of the company are down less than 1% in premarket trading. The stock, which has a market value of $256 billion, is up 30% over the last 12 months. Coke executives told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in late January that China accounts for about 10% of its global volume but less of its profits and revenue. The company expects to provide more information about the outbreak's impact on its business during its first-quarter earnings call in April. Coke will be presenting at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Florida, later on Friday.",finance
Amrita Khalid,2/21/2020,qz,Coronavirus will lead to a further drop in smartphone shipments ” Quartz,https://qz.com/1806506/coronavirus-will-lead-to-a-further-drop-in-smartphone-shipments/,"Coronavirus may be another reason why you don't upgrade your smartphone this year. Industry forecasts anticipate that global smartphone production will be hit hard as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 that began in December. China, the smartphone manufacturing hub of the world, is now choked off from suppliers, workers, and logistics networks. Analysis firm TrendForce predicted this week that production of smartphones will have decreased by 12% in the first three months of 2020, compared to the same period last year. Apple announced earlier this week that it doesn't expect to meet its second-quarter financial guidance due to stalled production in China as a result of the outbreak. Most of Apple's retail stores in China remain closedΒ after shutting down last month. Samsung, which moved much of its production to Vietnam in recent years, is alsoΒ likely to face production delays. Vietnam's Ministry of Industry of Trade told Reuters that supply chain problems as a result of the coronavirus will likely delay production of Samsung's latest models. Vietnam relies much on China for materials and equipment, which makes the country become vulnerable when such outbreak happens, it said. Samsung's S20 Galaxy lineup, announced this month, will begin shipping in March; Samsung has not confirmed if the outbreak will delay when those phones hit stores. Delays in production aren't the only threat to the smartphone industry. China is also the world's largest smartphone market. Domestic smartphone manufacturers like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo will be hit with a double-whammy: less demand for their products and delayed production as consumers and workers stay home. A drop in demand in China will be a major factor in a decline in smartphone sales, according to Anna Ahrens, an analyst with IHS Markit.Β There needs to be time for people to get back to normal life, and demand will not recover fast. But the smartphone industry's struggles predate the coronavirus outbreak. Global smartphone sales have already been on the decline, partly because people are holding on to their handsets for longer. Advances in technology have extended battery life and upgraded camera tech to the point that many users don't see the point of giving up perfectly good devices that are two or even three upgrade cycles out-of-date. Most smartphone manufacturers saw fewer shipments in 2019 than 2018, according to analysis from IHS Markit. In this environment, one might expect the price of smartphones to increase. But it's unlikely consumers will see higher-priced phones this year as a result of the coronavirus. Far more likely are temporary shortages, delays in fulfilling orders, or stores not having certain models in stock. In the short run, I don't think prices will rise, because most brands don't want to be seen as taking advantage or profit from a bad situation, said Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester, in an interview with Quartz. And even in the long run, price increases may be unlikely. Why? Because most smartphone users may decide to just wait out the storm, and companies will lose out on new sales. Most people can keep using the phones they have and delay an upgrade, said Gillett.",tech
"Amy Woodyatt, Ivana KottasovΓ΅, James Griffiths and Helen Regan, CNN",2/21/2020,cnn,China changed how it counts coronavirus cases again. Here's why,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/health/coronavirus-reported-cases-covid-19-change-intl/index.html," Weeks after the novel coronavirus crisis began in December, there is still widespread confusion over the exact number of cases reported in China and whether the epidemic is finally stabilizing at the outbreak's epicenter of Hubei province. On Thursday, China announced just 394 new confirmed cases, the lowest number of daily infections reported in weeks. But on Friday, the confirmed number of cases in mainland China increased toΒ 889, according to the country's National Health Commission. This fluctuation could be partly down to a change this week in what is counted as a ""confirmed case"" in Hubei province, the epicenter of the global outbreak. Here's what we know. How has China changed its method? Read More Last week, Hubei province announced it would count ""clinically diagnosed"" cases in its numbers. These were patients who demonstrated all the symptoms of Covid-19 but either had not been able to get a test or were believed to have falsely tested negative. No US coronavirus cases were caught by airport temperature checks. Here's what has worked Hubei doctors could use CT scans to confirm such coronavirus infections without a test. That decision saw confirmed cases in Hubei province soar, with more than 15,152 new infections announced in mainland China on February 12 alone. Officials said the move to include clinically diagnosed patients was intended to help clear a backlog of suspected cases in Hubei. But on Thursday the government guidelines changed and ""clinically confirmed"" were excluded from the tally of confirmed cases. Now patients must have a positive lab test result to be counted in the tally. Other cases will be listed as ""suspected."" The World Health Organization (WHO) reacted to the change in their Friday situation report, noting:  ""Some previously reported 'clinically diagnosed' cases are thus expected to be discarded over the coming days as laboratory testing is conducted and some are found to be Covid-19-negative."" Adding to the confusion is that on Friday, Hubei health authorities announced another new development. Tu Yuanchao, deputy director of Hubei Health Committee, said at a press conference that the provincial government has banned the practice of reducing the number of already confirmed cases. Tu said that all the cases that were confirmed but then retroactively dismissed as they no longer fitted the reporting requirements would be added back to the total tally. ""These adjustments in numbers have attracted huge public attention, caused some doubts about the data. As a result, Ying Yong, secretary of the provincial Party committee, attached great importance to this issue. He explicitly ordered that no subtraction be allowed for already-confirmed cases and all subtractions be added back,"" Tu said. Why has China done this? China cited improved testing capacity of the novel coronavirus as the reason for changing the way confirmed cases are counted in Hubei province, officials said Thursday. Wang Guiqiang, director of the Society of Infectious Diseases of the Chinese Medical Association, said: ""In order to resolve the conflict between diagnosis and treatment, in Hubei, such clinical diagnosis was introduced to enable timely treatment of possible patients and reduce fatality rate. ""But now that the situation in Hubei has changed. The nucleic acid testing capability has been greatly improved. And now all suspected cases or unconfirmed cases can be tested for nucleic acids quickly. Nucleic acid testing is no longer an issue."" Nucleaic acids -- such as DNA -- are the main information-carrying molecules of the cell. Nucleic acid tests analyze swabs taken from a patient's saliva or mucus and look for the genetic materials of the virus. However, scientists have pointed to problems with the nucleic acid test producing false negatives, meaning infected patients could be going undetected. There are also reports in parts of China that a shortage of testing kits and inaccurate results are leading to long delays in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients.

Angus Liu,2/21/2020,fiercepharma,"FiercePharmaAsia”Coronavirus's impact on AstraZeneca, global drug supply; vadadustat PRV",https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma-asia/fiercepharmaasia-coronavirus-s-impact-astrazeneca-global-drug-supply-vadadustat-prv,"Although the novel coronavirus has not caused any drug shortages, health regulators around the globe are preparing for potential disruptions as the outbreak drags on. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca is also expecting the outbreak to hit its business in 2020 given its high exposure to the Chinese market. Akebia Therapeutics will use a priority review voucher to speed things up with the evaluation of Otsuka-partnered anemia drug vadadustat, a potential rival to FibroGen and AZ's roxadustat. And more. AstraZeneca's China sales grew by 28% at constant currencies in the fourth quarter to $1.19 billion, which accounted for 19% of the drugmaker's total quarterly haul. AZ's been projecting a mid-teens growth rate for its China business in the midterm due to a value-based procurement program. But the ongoing coronavirus represents a more imminent threat. The story of CMIC's rise from being a startup in a one-room apartment to a multinational leader is defined by an ability and readiness to foresee the changing needs of biopharma companies and adapt accordingly. With pipelines primed to continue evolving in the coming years, that adaptable approach is now more important than ever. As the COVID-19 outbreak continues in China, the FDA has halted all plant inspections there for now. While the drug and medical device supply chains have held so far, the agency's keeping an eye out for potential disruptions to supply or shortages, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said her group has a task force monitoring supplies, and no shortages have occurred. India'sΒ government determined local drugmakers have about two months of API supply on hand. Akebia Therapeutics will use a priority review voucher license Vifor Pharma has bought to shave four months off the FDA review of oral anemia drug vadadustat. Akebia is sharing U.S. rights to the drug with Otsuka. The pair is racing against FibroGen and AstraZeneca's roxadustat in the novel HIF-PHI class, which is being billed as a more convenient and safer alternative to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. New Astellas, Seattle Genetics Padcev combo data spark $5.8B sales hopes Pairing Astellas and Seattle Genetics' Padcev with Merck's Keytruda induced a response in 73.3% of previously untreated bladder cancer patients who're ineligible for cisplatin chemo in a phase 1b/2 study. Patients went a median 12.3 months without tumor progression, the update showed. SVB Leerink's Andrew Berens projected the durability could help Padcev achieve $5.8 billion in peak sales. Audentes Therapeutics, which was just bought by Astellas, is pouring $109 million into building a 135,000-square-foot gene therapy manufacturing facility in Sanford, North Carolina. The first phase is expected to be operational by 2021. Eventually, the site will employ 200.",healthcare

Here's your Daily Crunch for February 21, 2020. 1. PC shipments expected to drop this year because of coronavirus outbreak The coronavirus outbreak could result in at least a 3.3% drop ” and as high as a 9% dip ” in the volume of PCs that will ship globally this year, according to research firm Canalys. In the best-case scenario, production levels are expected to revert to full capacity by April 2020, hence the biggest hit will be to sell-in shipments in the first two quarters, with the market recovering in Q3 and Q4, the firm said. 2. Shopify joins Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra Association After eBay, Visa, Stripe and other high-profile partners ditched the Facebook-backed cryptocurrency collective, Libra scored a win with the addition of Shopify. The e-commerce platform will become a member of Libra Association, contributing at least $10 million and operating a node that processes transactions for the Facebook-originated stable coin. 3. Quibi's streaming service app launches in app stores for pre-order Quibi, the mobile-only streaming service from Jeffrey Katzenberg, is now open for pre-orders. The company declined to fully show off its app only a month ago at CES ” instead, demos focused on its TurnStyle technology ” but it appears the app is ready nonetheless. 4. Volocopter extends Series C funding to $94M with backing from logistics giant DB Schenker and others With this new funding, Volocopter brings its total raised to around $132 million, and it says it will use the newly acquired capital to help certify its VoloCity aircraft, an air taxi designed to transport people, which is on track to become the company's first-ever vehicle licensed for commercial operation. 5.

Associated Press,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Global airlines trade group says coronavirus may cost industry $29 billion,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/global-airlines-trade-group-says-coronavirus-may-cost-industry-29-billion-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"TOKYO (AP) ” The outbreak of the new virus threatens to erase $29 billion of this year's revenue for global airlines, mostly for Chinese carriers, as travel crashes worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association. The trade group for global airlines said Thursday that the virus causing COVID-19 has the potential for causing a 13% decline in demand for Asian carriers this year. The contraction comes at a time when Asian airlines' sales had been growing, the group said. Global air traffic will be reduced by 4.7% for the year, marking the first overall decline in such demand since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, IATA said in a statement. How profits will be affected was still unclear, it said. The estimates foresee a scenario where COVID-19 has a V-shaped impact, similar to what happened during the SARS virus outbreak in 2003, with a sharp dive followed by a quick recovery, according to IATA. The virus, which began in China late last year, has sickened more than 75,000 people in China, Some 2,000 people have died in China. More than 1,000 cases have been found outside mainland China. International airlines including British Airways IAG, -3.92% , Germany's Lufthansa LHA, -2.21% , Australia's Qantas and the three largest U.S. airlines have suspended flights to China, in some cases until late April or May. Cathay Pacific 293, -2.53% asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave to help it weather the crisis. Travel restrictions inside China and fear of the illness have devastated demand for domestic flights in the fast-growing China market. Many nations are warning people not to travel to China, or barring travelers from China, especially from the Wuhan area, at the center of the outbreak. People around the world are also voluntarily scaling back travel, while some governments and health experts are encouraging people to stay indoors not only in China but also South Korea and Japan to avoid getting infected. These are challenging times for the global air transport industry. Stopping the spread of the virus is the top priority, said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO. This will be a very tough year for airlines. Analysts at Cowen, a U.S. investment bank and financial services company, noted IATA might be underestimating the impact on Asia travel outside of China, noting the recent reports of dozens of cases in South Korea. While still relatively small, and too early to tell if it will spread further, we see this as a material negative data point on the global containment of the virus, the Cowen report said.",business
Australian Associated Press,2/21/2020,theguardian,Australia relaxes coronavirus travel ban to allow some students from mainland China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/australia-relaxes-coronavirus-travel-ban-to-allow-some-students-from-mainland-china,"Australia will start relaxing travel bans for some high school students from China but not university students. The federal government says a decision on university students could be in a week. Year 11 and 12 students “ other than those from the Hubei province at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak “ will be allowed to enter. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said this the Covid-19 virus was in Australia “ and infection rates in China are falling “ and medical advice was that the Australian border force continues to provide case-by-case exemptions to the travel ban from mainland China. In particular that should include consideration of year 11 and 12 secondary school students from mainland China, excluding Hubei, he said in Melbourne on Saturday. There are about 400 year 12 students and 360 year 11 students enrolled in Australian schools who have not been able to enter the country. They students can now apply for an exemption to the travel restrictions applied to foreign nationals who have been in mainland China. Austalia's chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, was confident that allowing a small number of additional people from mainland China would not impose any material risk to the Australian population. We are already letting in Australian citizens and permanent residents, and the good news in the last few weeks from mainland China has been there have been very very few exported cases of this disease, he said. The federal education minister. Dan Tehan, said: It is incredibly important that we get some normality back to the international student market. At this stage we are looking at year 11 and 12 students but the medical advice has said in a week we could look at what would happen with tertiary education students.",general
Barbara Kollmeyer,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Goldman Sachs warns of imminent risk for stocks due to complacency on coronavirus,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-warns-a-near-term-correction-risk-for-stocks-grows-as-coronavirus-complacency-abounds-2020-02-20?mod=article_inline,"While investors may be tired of hearing how virus-complacent they are, as stocks keep busting records, our call of the day from Goldman Sachs is saying exactly that. In the nearer term¦we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high, chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer told clients. The virus history books ” SARS in 2003 ” reveal that setbacks for markets are often temporary. But China's economy is six times bigger now than it was then, with Chinese tourism a 0.4% chunk of global GDP and missed work days in China equal to an two-month unplanned break for the entire U.S., he notes. Oppenheimer points to Apple's AAPL, -0.59% latest warning that Wall Street largely shrugged off, noting that the company has been driving better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results. During the fourth quarter, the five largest stocks in the S&P 500 (Facebook FB, +1.96% , Amazon AMZN, +0.87% , Apple AAPL, -0.59% , Microsoft MSFT, +1.45% , Google owner Alphabet GOOGL, +1.19% ) posted an average earnings surprise of +20%, compared with just 4% for the average S&P 500 company.  Any weakness to these and other companies would likely push earnings estimates lower, cautions Oppenheimer. Don't look to stretched valuations in bond markets versus stocks to immunize against an equity pullback, he said. Not a sustained bear market, but don't hit the snooze button is the message. Last word goes to JPMorgan's top quantitative strategist Marko Kolanovic, who notes investors have been piling into technology, low-volatility stocks and bonds, driven by coronavirus fears and as passive-funds pile into stock winners. As a fan of value stocks, Kolanovic expects a rotation back to that asset class once the virus subsides. We caution investors that this bubble will likely collapse, i.e. this time is not different,' with valuations reverting closer to 2010-2020 average, he warns in a note.

Reuters Wall Street stocks were set for a weaker open on Friday, as investors continued to face a wall of worries about the coronavirus outbreak's spread beyond China's borders. South Korean health officials declared an emergency in one major city as a cluster of fresh cases was announced. On the heels of Thursday's weak finish, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures dropped 0.3% each, while Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.4%. That is as jittery investors continued to drive up gold prices and down 10-year Treasury note yields. Perhaps the reality of the situation is starting to hit home for investors or maybe, and probably more likely, they're using the slew of warnings to take some profit and risk off the table, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe.

The most common narrative in markets is what to do when the next recession comes along ” own Treasurys, own gold, own quality to such an extent that my concern would almost be that if the next recession is of a more normal variety, such as a stock retracement of 10% to 15% and moderate declines in unemployment, you'll find that you have overprotected yourself and the underperformance could actually be in the areas which you thought were giving you safety, Hobbs told MarketWatch. The truth is, investors can't reliably predict recessions, and shouldn't be obsessing about it, he said. What we can say is some of the previous causes of some of the nastiest recessions in history are so far substantially absent and Barclays thinks the economic cycle can carry on for a little while longer.

Earlier in the day, Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total in the country to 18. Seven people with the flu-like virus were diagnosed in Qom, four people in Tehran and two in Gilan. The small outbreak in Iran has been linked to a case in Canada and another infection of a 45-year-old woman in Lebanon after those patients traveled to the Middle East nation. ""The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although the numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Friday at a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva. ""These dots are actually very concerning."" Health officials are receiving information about the patients in Iran, but ""we have to engage them even more,"" Tedros said. World health officials still have a chance to contain the virus, he said, but it's getting less likely by the day. ""The window of opportunity is still there, but our window of opportunity is narrowing,"" he said. ""We need to act quickly before it closes completely."" He also cautioned: ""This outbreak could still go in any direction."" Iran's health-care system has the ""basic capacity"" to detect and contain the coronavirus, said Dr. Jaouad Mahjour, assistant director of emergency preparedness at WHO. World health officials said they remain concerned about the potential spread of the virus to countries with weaker health systems. Outside of China, there are 1,152 cases across 26 countries, including eight deaths, Tedros said. World health officials have said the respiratory disease is capable of spreading through human-to-human contact, droplets carried through sneezing and coughing and germs left on inanimate objects. There are no proven therapies for the new virus. Preliminary results from two clinical trials testing potential treatments for COVID-19 are expected in three weeks, Tedros said on Thursday. One trial combines HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, while the other is testing U.S.-based biotech Gilead Sciences' antiviral remdesivir. Local authorities in China have been using remdesivir, which was tested as a possible treatment during the Ebola outbreak, to fight infections. Some authorities are also using antiviral drug Kaletra, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, on a compassionate basis.

""We're not seeing community spread here in the United States, yet, but it's very possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. ""Our goal continues to be slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread."" Messonnier said the CDC is working with state and local health departments ""to ready our public health workforce to respond to local cases and the possibility this outbreak could become a pandemic."" The CDC is collaborating with supply chain partners, hospitals, pharmacies and manufacturers to understand what medical supplies are needed, she said. ""This will help CDC understand when we may need to take more aggressive measures to ensure that health-care workers on the front lines have access to the supplies that they need,"" she said. ""We are reviewing all of our pandemic materials and adapting them to COVID-19."" Messonnier pointed to China, where schools and businesses have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same. ""The day may come where we may need to implement such measures in this country,"" she said. The CDC is changing the way it categorizes confirmed cases in the U.S. to separate out people who've been repatriated to the country with the virus from China and from a cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan, she said. As of Friday morning, the CDC had confirmed 13 infections that were transmitted on U.S. soil and 21 cases that were brought into the country, she said. The U.S. evacuated 329 Americans this week from the Diamond Princess ship, which was quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan, after an outbreak emerged onboard earlier this month. Despite the quarantine, which kept passengers confined to their cabins, the virus infected more than 600 passengers and crew, including some Americans who are being treated in Japan, Messonnier said. ""There are several Americans with COVID-19 who are hospitalized in Japan and who are seriously ill,"" she said. Of the 329 Americans brought back from Japan, Messonnier said 18 of them tested positive for COVID-19. She said it's possible that some of those patients did not test positive before boarding the evacuation flights in Japan but that they were ""already incubating the disease."" Earlier in the day, World Health Organization officials said they were concerned with the virus outbreak in Iran, where local health officials have confirmed 18 new cases and 4 deaths in just two days. While a majority of cases are in China, the CDC has been working with the health-care sector to prepare for the virus to ""take a foothold in the U.S.,"" Messonnier told reporters Feb. 12.

Robin Hicks",2/21/2020,eco-business,How diversity is driving sustainability for one of Singapore's biggest insurers,https://www.eco-business.com/news/how-diversity-is-driving-sustainability-for-one-of-singapores-biggest-insurers/,"It took us 88 years to hire a head of ethics. And now we wonder how we've ever done without one, saidΒ Wilf Blackburn, the outgoing chief executive of life insurer Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (PACS), who has just moved into a regional role based in Hong Kong, after almost three and a half years running one of Singapore's biggest life insurers. An ethics function is still a rare thing in the insurance world, but PACS recognised the need for help in guiding its moral compass. Blackburn appointed Yeoh El Lynn to lead the ethics and sustainability team less than a year ago, moving her over from a role running the company's community investment arm. Around the time of her appointment, the company ran an ethics survey to examine how responsibleΒ the company is perceived to be among internal stakeholders. We thought that ethics was a given, but it's not. We thought it's hardwired, but it's not. We stumbled into the fact that we really needed an ethics team, as ethics is the only natural home for some topics, he said. Since the survey, the company has unearthed a recent case of workplace bullying that resulted in a dismissal. Wilf Blackburn. Image: Prudential Assurance Company Singapore If we hadn't done the survey, we might not have picked it up. Maybe it wouldn't have been called out as a problem if there wasn't the sense that management really cared, said the Brit, who says he's been trying to encourage a speak-up culture. Discrimination has been the focus of the ethics drive. Which is just as well, as Singapore announced stiff new penalties for disciminatory practices by employers in January this year. Employers that avoid hiring or keeping older people is a known concern in Singapore, and Prudential has introduced policies to weed out ageism. People were retiring at 62 because that's the statutory retirement age [in Singapore], said Blackburn. From an ethical point of view, we don't think that's right. So we scrapped the retirement age. We do have a big gender bias”towards women. The company does not ask interview candidates for their year of birth, or ask them to provide identity cards when they apply for a job. Prudential has alsoΒ raised the Central Provident Fund (CPF, Singapore's mandatory savings scheme) contribution rate it pays for its staff above the age of 55 to the level it pays younger employees. On the one level, it's about becoming a more attractive employer. But on another level, why should we discriminate at all? he said. In one area, the company might appear to discriminate. We do have a big gender bias”towards women, said Blackburn. Some 60 per cent of PACS's 1,200 staff are women, as are 60 per cent of the company's board. Is this a result of positive discrimination, Blackburn is asked. No, he said. It's just because the company treats different genders equally”including the amount they are paid. Gender pay parity in Singapore wasΒ news in JanuaryΒ when it emerged thatΒ Singapore women are paid about 6 per cent less than men. The company gives women 50 per cent more maternity leaveΒ than the statutory requirement (six months instead of four months). That's big in Singapore, because most companies here tend to just do the minimum, he said. PACS also gives male staff one week more than the statutory two weeks of paternity leave. What we do requires collaboration across the business. That requires better relationship-building and an ability to manage relationships.Β Male-dominated environments are more silo-based and internally competitive, said Blackburn. The design of Prudential's offices in the central business district and a liberal approach to work rules are part of the plan to create a fairer, more equitable workplace. The work space is open plan. There are no individual offices, cubicles, reserved seat spaces, job title name plaques, and staff have no fixed working hours, and come and go as they please. It's a meritocratic system with little hierarchy. As everyone is coming and going all the time, no one feels uncomfortable about going home to do whatever they need to do. And thatΒ removes a lot of stress for everyone. It's all part of helping our people to live longer”as that's the business we're in. All managers have to trust their people, and we put a lot of emphasis on trust. And we are performance driven. Everyone knows exactly what their objectives are, and there are big rewards for hitting targets. Our people are driven by outcomes rather than inputs, said Blackburn. A fitness session in Prudential Singapore's offices. Image: Prudential The company puts on free aerobics, mindfulness, yoga, and Tai Chi classes, which Blackburn says is in line with the company's main sustainability goal - to helpΒ people to live longer, healthier lives. It's not like all 1,200 staff sign up for everything. But these measures help them to think about sustaining their lives for longer. There's also free food, and all of it is healthy”apart from the free Tiger Beer that's on tap from 5pm every day. We take the view that if we create the right culture, to lead a sustainable life, the business benefits will follow, said Blackburn, who noted that the company had jumped 117 places in three years in a ranking of the best places to work in Singapore. Frankly, it's in our interests for our customers to stay healthy for longer, said Blackburn. One million Singapore residents use Prudential's life insurance, and healthier customers cut the probably of insurers paying out for hospital bills. Singapore overtook Japan as having the world's highest life expectancy”of 84.8 years”last year, and half of all babies now born in rich countries such as the city-stateΒ can expect to live until they're 100, Blackburn noted. A pricing approach for plans that reward healthy behaviour, and a corporate social responsibility programme that gifts the elderly poor with healthy food at Christmas time are among the company's efforts to fulfill its sustainability ambition. The firm has also been bombarding its customers with information about theΒ COVID-19 coronavirus, Blackburn said. Besides designing life insurance plans that help give sick people cover for longer, PACS has started to think harder about the impact it can have beyond its customer base. The company established an environmental, social and governance (ESG) committee last year, and has green policies in place for procurement, energy and waste management. It is also working on ensuring that the S$40 billion in investments its manages on behalf of its customersΒ are invested ethically, and is to publish its first sustainability report in the coming months. This year is the beginning of an important decade for climate action, said Blackburn. Regulators are discussing the role of insurance companies on ESG. But we think that we shouldn't wait for regulators in order to a responsible business.Β We think that companies should be proactive in responding to the big societal challenges of our time. Prudential Assurance Company Singapore is a strategic partner forΒ Unlocking Capital forΒ Sustainability, Eco-Business's upcoming conference on 10 September 2020.

By Choe Sang-Hun,2/21/2020,nytimes,Shadowy Church Is at Center of Coronavirus Outbreak in South Korea,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html,"Read live updates on the coronavirus outbreak here. SEOUL, South Korea ” At meetings of the secretive Shincheonji Church of Jesus, worshipers sit packed together on the floor, wearing no glasses ” or face masks. They come to church even when sick, former members say. After services, they split up into groups for Bible study, or to go out into the streets and proselytize. After the first coronavirus infection was reported among its members, they were told to lie about being followers, though the church later said that was not its policy. Now, health officials are zeroing in on the church's practices as they seek to contain South Korea's alarming coronavirus outbreak, in which members of Shincheonji, along with their relatives and others who got the virus from them, account for more than half of the confirmed infections. On Saturday, the number of cases in the country soared to 346 ” second only to mainland China, if the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is excluded from Japan's count. More than 1,250 other church members have reported potential symptoms, health officials said, raising the possibility that the nation's caseload could soon skyrocket further. In response, the government is shutting down thousands of day-care facilities, nursing homes and community centers, even banning the outdoor political rallies that are a feature of life in downtown Seoul. [Read: South Korean leader said coronavirus would disappear.' It was a costly error.] As of Saturday, more than 700 members of Shincheonji, which mainstream South Korean churches consider a cult, still could not be reached, according to health officials, who were frantically hoping to screen them for signs of infection. Shincheonji members know of their bad image and they usually hide their affiliation from nonchurch members, even from their parents, said Hwang Eui-jong, a pastor who has researched the church. No wonder many of them are unreachable. They must be huddled together somewhere, praying that this will eventually go away. The snowballing outbreak among the church's followers is testing South Korea's health care system, which successfully tamed a deadly outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2015. Experts on South Korean religious sects and former members of the church said its practices made its members unusually vulnerable to contagious diseases. Unlike other churches, Shincheonji makes its members sit on the floor tightly together during services, in neat, militarylike ranks and files, said Lee Ho-yeon, who left the church in 2015. We were not supposed to have anything on our faces, like glasses or masks. We were trained to sing our hymns loudly. We were taught not to be afraid of illness, Ms. Lee said. We were taught not to care about such worldly things like jobs, ambition or passion. Everything was focused on proselytizing, even when we were sick. The outbreak has struck hardest at Shincheonji's church in Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million in the country's southeast, where a 61-year-old woman known as Patient No. 31 is believed to be a link between many of the cases. The restrictions on public gatherings have been implemented more forcefully in Daegu than elsewhere in the country. [Update: Most coronavirus cases are mild. That's good and bad news.] Patient No. 31 checked into a small Daegu hospital on Feb. 7, after a minor traffic accident. The next day, she complained of a sore throat. The day after that ” a Sunday ” she attended a Shincheonji church service, health officials say. She developed a fever the next day, one that lingered, and she stayed in the hospital. Still, she slipped out the following Sunday to go to church again. At least 1,000 Shincheonji members attended one of those two Sunday services, officials said. At least twice, doctors recommended that the woman transfer to a bigger hospital to be tested for the coronavirus, but she refused, health officials said. She insisted that she had not visited China in recent months, nor had she met anyone known to have the virus. Finally, on Monday, she felt sick enough to check into a government-run clinic for a coronavirus test. On Tuesday, she was confirmed to be infected. Her behavior is not surprising to people familiar with the church, said Chung Yun-seok, an expert on religious cults who runs the website Christian Portal News. To them, getting sick is a sin because it prevents them from doing God's work. The church dismissed criticism of its practices on Friday, calling it slandering based on the prejudices among the established churches. It said its members sat close together on the floor because local authorities would not give it permits to build bigger churches. Health officials were still trying to figure out how Patient No. 31 contracted the disease. Mr. Hwang noted that the church had been proselytizing among ethnic Koreans in northeastern China, many of whom it invited to South Korea. Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the authorities were investigating reports that Shincheonji had operations in Hubei, the Chinese province that includes Wuhan, where the virus emerged. The South Korean news agency Newsis reported on Friday that Shincheonji had opened a church in Wuhan last year, and that references to it had been removed from the church's website. Church officials could not immediately be reached for comment. South Korean officials learned that Patient No. 31 had visited Cheongdo, a county near Daegu, in early February. As of Saturday, 108 patients and medical staff at a Cheongdo hospital had tested positive for the coronavirus; two of them died this week. Cheongdo is the birthplace of Lee Man-hee, the 88-year-old self-styled messiah who founded Shincheonji, and followers regularly go on pilgrimages there and do volunteer work. Church members are also believed to have attended the funeral of Mr. Lee's brother in Cheongdo in early February. On Friday, Newsis quoted Patient No. 31 as saying that she had not visited the hospital or attended the funeral, but that she had used a public bathhouse while in Cheongdo. We need a thorough investigation of the people who attended the church services and the funeral, President Moon Jae-in said on Friday while presiding over an emergency meeting on the outbreak. After the case of Patient No. 31 was first reported, social media messages went out to Shincheonji members telling them to continue their evangelical work in small groups. The messages also told members that if officials asked, they should deny that they belonged to the church or went to its services. But the church later said those messages did not reflect its official policy, and that it had disciplined the person who sent them out. Updated June 12, 2020 Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus ” whether it's surface transmission or close human contact ” is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was very rare,  but she later walked back that statement. A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation's job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid, says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. When you haven't been exercising, you lose muscle mass. Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren't being told to stay at home, it's still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. On Friday, Mr. Lee urged his members to follow the government's instructions, asking them to avoid gatherings and take their proselytizing online. This disease outbreak is the work of the devil, which is hellbent on stopping the rapid growth of the Shincheonji, he said in a message to his followers. South Korea has long been fertile ground for unorthodox religious groups, some of which have amassed enormous wealth and influence. After an overloaded ferry sank in 2014, killing more than 300 people, South Koreans were shocked to learn that the ferry company was controlled by a religious leader who had been shunned as a heretic by mainstream churches. Shincheonji claims 150,000 members and has 12 congregations in South Korea. It also has many smaller operations, which present themselves as cafes or churches of other denominations and are used for proselytizing, said Mr. Chung. Shincheonji has long been criticized for its aggressive evangelical work. Many mainstream churches post signs warning undercover Shincheonji missionaries not to try to infiltrate their congregations. Members of Shincheonji have recently targeted young South Koreans, offering them free tarot readings, personality tests and foreign-language classes, according to Mr. Hwang. Moon Yoo-ja, 60, who spent years trying to rescue her daughter from the church, accused Shincheonji of ruining many families. Once they fall into the trap of the church, they often abandon school and jobs, Ms. Moon said. Some housewives packed up and joined the church, abandoning their husbands and children. Hwang Gui-hag, editor in chief of the Seoul-based Law Times, which specializes in religious news, cautioned against focusing too much on Shincheonji's practices, some of which he said could be found in other South Korean churches. This is essentially not a religious issue, but a medical and health issue, Mr. Hwang said. If we pay too much attention to religion, we miss the point. How would you explain the huge outbreak in Wuhan, China, which is not really caused by any church?",business
By Denise Grady,2/21/2020,nytimes,"Coronavirus Cases in the United States Reach 34, and More Are Expected",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/health/coronavirus-cases-in-the-united-states-reach-34-and-more-are-expected.html,"At least 34 people in the United States are infected with the coronavirus spreading from China, federal health officials said on Friday. This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing. But so far there has been no community spread of the infection in the United States, she added; all of the cases have been linked to overseas travel. Eleven of the infections were diagnosed in travelers who fell ill after returning on their own from overseas, and two of their close contacts became infected. The other 21 patients are people who were returned to the United States by the State Department. More infections are expected among the people who were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and are currently in quarantine, Dr. Messonnier said. The coronavirus swept through the Diamond Princess after it docked in Yokohama, Japan, and the passengers were not allowed to disembark. More than 600 people onboard have been infected with the virus, testing has shown. Passengers from the ship account for 18 of the 21 cases in repatriated people in the United States. The other three patients had been evacuated earlier from Wuhan, China, the center of the epidemic. Because the Diamond Princess passengers may have been in contact with infected people on the ship, they are considered at high risk for infection, Dr. Messonnier said. Ten other passengers from the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus in Japan, but are not being counted among the infected yet, because the C.D.C. has not confirmed the tests. They will most likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said. Several Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. On Thursday, the State Department posted an advisory urging U.S. citizens to reconsider traveling by cruise ship to or within Asia. The department had already advised against travel to China. Of 329 people who were evacuated on two State Department flights, 18 are hospitalized, Dr. Messonnier said: 11 in Nebraska, five near California's Travis Air Force Base and two near Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. Fourteen of the Americans were found to have positive test results for the virus just before boarding two charter flights back to the United States. The State Department overruled objections from C.D.C. officials and placed the infected on the plane with healthy passengers. Reports of the disagreement were first published by The Washington Post. Asked during the briefing about the episode, Dr. Messonnier referred the question to Dr. William Walters, executive for operational medicine at the State Department's medical services bureau. Dr. Walters said that the test results arrived shortly before the passengers were to board the plane, and that on the flight the infected people were seated separately from the rest. He also said that despite the positive tests, the infected people had no symptoms. The decision was the right one in bringing these people home, he said. Dr. Messonnier said that decisions were being made in real time"" and that different perspectives will be brought to the table. Nonetheless, she added, We are one U.S. government working together. The response to the outbreak is being handled seamlessly, she said. So far, Dr. Messonnier said, there has been no community spread of the disease in the United States, which means no cases in which the source of the infection is not known. But looking ahead, community spread within the country is very possible and maybe even likely, she said. Cases detected by local health departments in travelers returning independently from overseas, or in their close contacts, are counted separately from infections in people who were evacuated from China by the State Department. Updated June 12, 2020 So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.

Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. When you haven't been exercising, you lose muscle mass. Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren't being told to stay at home, it's still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. The reason for the distinction, Dr. Messonnier said, is that the cases found locally more accurately represent what is happening within the United States. The C.D.C. is still performing most of the testing for the virus, Dr. Messonnier said. The agency had sent diagnostic test kits to all the states, so they could perform their own tests instead of sending samples to Atlanta. But the new kits were flawed and have yet to be replaced. Passengers quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base were to be moved on Friday to a different part of the base, to less uncomfortable quarters with more reliable heating and cooling, a C.D.C. official, Dr. Nancy Knight, told them during a conference call on Thursday. She said all were being offered tests for the virus, but would be required to stay for the full 14-day quarantine even if they tested negative. The reason is that if an infected person is still in the incubation period, the test may not be able to detect the virus yet. Anyone with a positive test will be tested again and will not be released until two consecutive tests give negative results, Dr. Knight said. The samples have to be sent to Atlanta, so each test takes a few days to complete. The testing is not mandatory, so people who have no symptoms and decline testing will be free to go after 14 days. In couples staying in the same room at the base, if one becomes ill, then the other must begin the 14-day quarantine process all over again, starting with the day the partner's symptoms began. Because the quarantine is on a military base, all incoming mail has to be inspected, which can delay delivery by several days. One man on the conference call with Dr. Knight said he was expecting prescription medicine by mail and worried that his supply would run out before he would be allowed to receive the new shipment. Officials on the call did not offer a way to expedite delivery for him. As of Friday, the coronavirus has infected more than 76,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed at least 2,240.",business
By Farnaz Fassihi,2/21/2020,nytimes,Iran's Stacked Election Is Expected to Produce a Hard-Line Parliament,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/middleeast/iran-2020-elections.html,"When Iranians go to the polls on Friday they will be taking part in what may be the least representative and least fair election in the Islamic Republic's history. While Iran's parliamentary elections have never been free and democratic, Iran's clerical leadership disqualified more than 7,000 candidates from running this year, including most of the moderates and centrists, paving the way for tougher domestic and foreign policies. At a time when Iran is navigating extraordinary challenges at home and abroad ” from the possibility of conflict with the United States to crippling economic sanctions and a restive population ” Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appears to have concluded that the best way to manage the turmoil is to squelch dissenting voices and assure a Parliament that would rubber-stamp conservative policies. The next Parliament will be completely obedient to Khamenei, more radical in their approach, and the little voices of dissent we hear on different issues will be silenced, said Roozbeh Mirebrahimi, an independent Iran analyst based in New York. About three-quarters of the current members of Parliament, where moderates and centrists make up a near majority, were barred from seeking re-election. The new Parliament is expected to embrace a hard line against the United States and would be unlikely to support efforts to negotiate a new nuclear agreement or respond positively to American demands like ending support for proxy militias and allies across the Middle East. To the contrary, analysts expect Iran to beef up ties with proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and militias in Iraq and Syria. Many conservative candidates adopted the slogan I am Qassim Suleimani, a reference to the Iranian military leader who oversaw Iran's regional proxies and who was killed by an American airstrike last month. These candidates pledged to pursue harsh revenge against the United States for the killing. The heightened antipathy toward the United States may be at least partly the result of Trump administration policies. President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who staked his career on the nuclear agreement with the United States and European powers, was kneecapped when President Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2016. Mr. Rouhani and moderate lawmakers ” who hold 122 seats in the current 290-member Parliament ” had bet that the lifting of economic sanctions in exchange for accepting limits on Iran's nuclear program would end Iran's economic isolation and bring foreign investment and prosperity. Instead, the United States tightened sanctions in 2018, which have damaged the economy, cratered oil exports and brought hardship to many. Soaring gas prices set off mass antigovernment protests in November, which the government put down with violence, killing hundreds of protesters. The Rouhani program, in the eyes of many Iranians, failed to deliver. One priority for the new Parliament will be to curtail the policies of Mr. Rouhani and his administration for his remaining time in office, until spring 2022. Mr. Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, widely disliked by conservatives as too pro-Western, are likely to face obstacles at every turn. The conservatives are pushing a program of economic resistance, an effort to make Iran more self-reliant, less dependent on global markets and trade, and closer to Russia and China. Ayatollah Khamenei has final say on these policies, but Parliament has the ability to shape, defend or criticize them. The current Parliament advocated Iran remaining committed to the nuclear deal with world powers, to engage in diplomacy rather than confrontation, and to sign an international agreement against money laundering. All of those policies are at risk. In Washington, the Trump administration said Thursday that it was freezing the assets of five Iranian election officials over the mass disqualifications. Unfortunately for the Iranian people, the real election took place in secret long before any ballots were even cast, Brian Hook, the State Department's special envoy for Iran policy, told reporters. Iranians know that tomorrow's election is political theater, he said. It is a republic in name only when the government disqualifies half of the candidates running for office. The five sanctioned officials were members of the Guardian Council, a panel that vets political candidates and wields oversight of Parliament. Turnout in the election is expected to be at an all time low in the capital, Tehran, and other big cities. Many ordinary Iranians, prominent activists and moderate politicians plan to boycott. This is an engineered selection, not an election, so I am not voting, said Mostafa Tajzadeh, a prominent moderate politician and former acting interior minister. This level of disqualifications is unprecedented and very alarming. Some Iranians said they had lost hope in the idea of changing Iran through the ballot box. I'm not voting because my vote doesn't count, said Roya, a 41-year-old business owner in Tehran, who asked not to use her last name. They don't listen to our demands and only want use our votes to show they have popular support. Ali Gholizadeh, a 34-year-old political activist from Mashhad and a university lecturer, said he and his family are not opponents of the clerical leadership but still they would not vote on Friday. I care about national security, I care about my country but I can't stand how they have such total disrespect of the public, he said in a telephone interview. These are sham elections. Nobody was allowed to run except their own people. Another potential deterrent for turnout was the news of a coronavirus outbreak in the city of Qum, a Shiite religious center that has a constant flow of pilgrims going in and out of the city. Two people have died in Qum from the virus and five more were reported infected on Thursday. Health officials in Qum warned people to stay away from public spaces, raising alarm about the safety of tightly packed polling stations and a requirement that voters stamp their fingers in a public ink well. Qum's governor said Thursday that elections would be held as planned and voters should bring their own pens to mark their ballots. He said polling stations would be equipped with masks and disinfectants. On social media, ardent supporters of the Islamic Republic tweeted that the coronavirus would not deter them from their civic duty. Some suggested that foreign powers like the United States may have had a hand in spreading it to keep people from voting. Coronavirus is such a smart virus! It showed up in Iran just a day before elections, tweeted Ali Akbar Raefipour, a hard-line conservative commentator. The U.S. is stooping so low and its local stooges are trying so hard. Supporters of the disqualifications defended them, saying the ousted candidates were not fit to run, either because they were corrupt or disloyal to Ayatollah Khamenei and the Islamic revolution. There are enough reformist candidates on the ballot, Foad Izadi, a conservative political analyst, said in a telephone interview from Tehran. The new Parliament will be stronger and more united with a better oversight role. They will use all the tools they have to keep Rouhani's ministers in line. Voters will have a choice among various shades of conservatives: a new generation of zealot technocrats; religious and anti-corruption hard-liners; or members of the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the military. In Tehran, for example, 134 conservatives are running against 28 moderate candidates for 30 seats. Only one well-known moderate politician is running. In the city of Mashhad, not a single reformist or centrist candidate is on the ballot. And for the first time, a former Revolutionary Guards commander, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, could become the next speaker of Parliament. Mr. Ghalibaf, a former Tehran mayor and chief of police, is the lead conservative candidate in Tehran. Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington.",business
By Julian E. Barnes and Sydney Ember,2/21/2020,nytimes,Russia Is Said to Be Interfering to Aid Bernie Sanders in 2020 Election,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/us/politics/bernie-sanders-russia.html,"WASHINGTON ” Russia has been trying to intervene in the Democratic primaries to aid Senator Bernie Sanders, according to people familiar with the matter, and Mr. Sanders said on Friday that intelligence officials recently briefed him. The disclosure came a day before the Nevada caucuses, where Mr. Sanders is a favorite, and followed revelations a day earlier that Moscow was interfering on President Trump's behalf this year, as it did in 2016. Mr. Sanders denounced Russia in a statement, calling President Vladimir V. Putin an autocratic thug and warning Moscow to stay out of the election. Drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump, he said he would stand against any efforts by Russia or another foreign power to interfere in the vote. The intelligence community is telling us they are interfering in this campaign right now in 2020, Mr. Sanders separately told reporters in Bakersfield, Calif., where he held a rally on Friday. And what I say to Mr. Putin: If elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections.' Mr. Sanders said he was briefed about a month ago. Asked why the disclosure came out now, he said: I'll let you guess about one day before the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? On Friday, the president aggressively disputed that Russia was interfering on his behalf. He called the disclosures a hoax and part of a partisan campaign against him. At a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Putin would prefer Mr. Sanders, who honeymooned in Moscow. Mr. Sanders and his wife traveled to the Soviet Union in 1988 on a trip that political opponents have called their honeymoon, a term that the couple have jokingly used, too. Russia's interference on behalf of both Mr. Trump, the dominant force in the Republican Party, and Mr. Sanders, a stalwart of the left, underscores its efforts to sow chaos across the political spectrum. Undermining the democratic system remains at the core of Russia's effort to raise its own stature by weakening the United States, according to current and former officials. Russia's interference measures and their intensity remain murky, even as intelligence officials sound alarms. In briefings to House Intelligence Committee members last week and to Mr. Sanders, officials said that Russia was actively interfering in the campaign, and people at the House briefing said intelligence officials said that Russia had a preference for Mr. Trump. Revelations about the House briefing enraged the president, who complained that Democrats would use Moscow's support for him against him, people familiar with the matter said. Days later, he replaced the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, though administration officials have said it was not a direct result of the briefing. Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany whom Mr. Trump appointed this week to replace Mr. Maguire, asked the agencies under his purview on Friday to provide the raw information and analysis that went into the briefing, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Grenell's appointment has drawn criticism from former intelligence officials who question his lack of experience and his record as a partisan ideologue. He immediately began a major personnel reshuffle, forcing out the official acting as the top deputy to the director of national intelligence. Other officials have hastened planned exits, as Mr. Grenell looks to install his own team. transcript From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.  Today: U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Russian government is supporting two very different candidates in the 2020 presidential race. David Sanger on why Russia is rooting for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. It's Wednesday, February 26. David, tell us about these intelligence briefings. Well, the first one, and in some ways the most interesting one, is shrouded in a lot of mystery. We know that about a month ago, the F.B.I. went to Bernie Sanders. Mm-hmm. The F.B.I. frequently comes around to give general warnings to all the candidates, but that's not what this was all about. This was about a very specific finding. And their message was, we have reason to believe that the Russians, through their own calculus, have determined that you're their favorite candidate among the Democrats in the primary. Hmm. And that they may well already be intervening on your behalf. And David, what was Sanders's reaction, as both a senator and a presidential candidate, to this piece of information? The only reaction that we know about, Michael, is that he decided to keep it secret. He hasn't said very much about what he thought about it. He just decided to say nothing about it, which itself is a really interesting choice. What do you mean? Well, he said that because it was classified, and he doesn't talk about classified briefings, he just stayed silent. But there are lots of political reasons for him to stay silent as well. Like what? He doesn't want to appear or be portrayed by President Trump as Russia's favorite or Russia's dupe in the election. If you're Bernie Sanders and you're thinking ahead to the general election, you only want one Russian puppet to be in this election, and you want it to be Donald Trump. So he knew right away that Trump would use this as an effort to try to equalize what the Russians were doing on behalf of President Trump in 2016 ” Gotcha. ” and what we think they will be doing with what they're doing with Bernie Sanders. Because if the Russians are backing both of them, it's like the Russians are backing neither of them. OK, so that's intelligence briefing number one. What about the second one? Well, the second one is bigger, a lot more formal, and we know a lot more about it. It was February 13. [MUSIC]: And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. We are live from Las Vegas where, in less than an hour, our Democratic presidential town halls will begin. And we have more on that in just a moment. But first, the breaking news. And the Director of National Intelligence Office, Shelby Pierson, has the unenviable job of being the mission manager for election interference for the Director of National Intelligence, goes in to brief the House Intelligence Committee. Hmm. And so the first thing she says is: There is Russian interference underway. The second thing she says is: The Russians had and still have a preference for Donald Trump as president. So unlike the Sanders briefing, this one does leak. This is not a four-year-ago flashback, folks. This is 2020. Well, Democrats are rekindling an old flame ” Russia collusion. Yes. I mean, this is so idiotic. And you notice how when they win elections, the Russians didn't do anything? Mm. So ” And a few days after that leaks out, we learn about the Sanders briefing a month before. And of course, as soon as these leak, everyone's furious. And if this came out a month ago, how do you think it came out now, if you had the briefing a month ago? I'll let you guess about one day before the Iowa ” Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? It was The Washington Post? Good friends. Sanders is furious that the news of his briefing came out just before the Nevada caucuses. Right. And blames, among others, corporate media. Because The Washington Post had, I think, first broken this story. President Trump is furious that it's back in the ether again that the Russians are involved in the election and behind him. Here we go again. Did you see it? This story. Aren't people bored? And so at a rally in Las Vegas, he says, this is all fabrication. It's all coming from the Democrats. I was told that was happening. I was told a week ago. They said, you know, they're trying to start a rumor. It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done ” Do Nothing Democrats. No, actually, it was coming from his own Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all of whom work for him. These people are crazy! So regardless of how this became public ” and it seems like both Sanders and Trump are very unhappy that it did become public ” it is public now that Russia is supportive of both President Trump and Bernie Sanders. So how did the intelligence community come to that conclusion? What are they seeing out there? Well, we don't know exactly how they came to it, because this is wrapped up in their sources and methods ” the one thing that they protect more than anything. Mm-hmm. We think they have humans sources inside Russia. They certainly did in 2016, a unique human source who had access to the Kremlin. They certainly have lines into Russian networks. That's what the National Security Agency does. And finally, they get to see some of the product as it shows up on Facebook or Reddit or something like that. Mm-hmm. And here, the differences from 2016 are really fascinating. Like what? Well, in 2016, you'll remember that there were Russians who were posing as Americans and putting out Facebook ads or going into Facebook posts. They got booted off for inauthentic behavior ” they weren't really Americans. So what are they doing now? They're putting much of the same kind of propaganda and false charges on forums like Reddit, hoping that they will get picked up by real Facebook users, who are real Americans, and will be repeated on their posts. And of course, Facebook can't throw them off, because they're real Americans expressing their political views. They're protected by First Amendment rights. And it would be pretty unseemly if Facebook began tossing off Americans saying, oh, you heard that from a Russian bot. Hmm. In the Cold War, the Soviets called these people useful idiots because they unintentionally picked up a Russian theme, a piece of disinformation, and repeated it until it became organic. Right. In the election, they might call them useful partisans, because they're going to pluck this out of the political ether, repeat it on cable television, presumably in support of Senator Sanders or President Trump, or maybe someone else who emerges. So David, how do you make sense of the fact that Russia is trying to help the two candidates in the race who are about as ideologically far apart as imaginable ” Trump, Sanders ” at the same time? Well, Michael, I've been trying to puzzle this out, because at first, it didn't seem to make any sense to me. And then, the more interviewing I did with more experts that I trust, they all said, you know, David, actually, it makes perfect sense. And it makes perfect sense for three reasons. So the first one is that both these candidates are at the outer extremes of their own parties. Not the far extreme, but they attract really partisan supporters. And the best way to create chaos is to have two polarized groups of political supporters going after each other. Mm. You know, the Trump supporters and the Sanders supporters, they don't leave a whole lot of space in the middle. And if you're the Russians, that's perfect. It's the equivalent of creating a drought in the forest, just before you toss in the match. Remember, the Russians don't go out and create the conditions. All they do is go out and exploit the conditions. Help me understand what the exploitation of a polarized Sanders and Trump electorate looks like. Well, you could take any of a number of issues that are hot-button social issues and use that to further divide Americans. We give hundreds of millions of dollars. You know what they give to us? Nothing. Nothing. They give us nothing. Criminals! You can use immigration, right? On which they differ dramatically. Day one, we will rescind all of Trump's hateful and racist immigration executive orders. [APPLAUSE] You can use Medicare for All, on which they differ dramatically. You could use the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, on which they differ dramatically. So ” And just kind of pump up those issues on social media, on your Reddit page, and hope it gets picked up on Facebook. And just generally make Americans angry at each other over it? Have the country screaming at each other. Bottom line is Donald Trump is dangerous and toxic for this country. For many reasons, I think Bernie Sanders is a dangerous man, but the thing that I thought ” I do. I mean, I think he's a very dangerous man. This is someone who is not stable. And I've been saying it from the beginning, and I will continue to say it until somebody looks into his mental stability. The socialist wing has completely taken over and is now in control, where the moderate voices no longer matter at this point in the race. And why is chaos good for Russia? I can tell why it's bad for us. It makes the United States look like a place that can't get its act together. It helps lead to charges of election interference and election irregularities that bring American elections down to the level of Russian elections. Hmm. It makes democracy look like a chaotic form of governance that can't really be trusted to make progress.  Best of all, you're weakening the United States, keeping it consumed in some domestic furor, rather than thinking about pushing back against the Russians in Syria, or elsewhere in the Middle East, or in Crimea, or coming to the support of your allies in NATO. We'll be right back. OK. So that's theory number one, which kind of seems to see both of these candidates as co-equals in the creation of a chaotic American political life. That's right. What is theory number two for why Russia would be rooting for both Trump and Sanders? Well, theory number two is truly cynical, Michael. It's that the Russians really do favor Trump, and they think that Bernie Sanders is the most beatable Democrat. Hmm. Now, they may be wrong about that. There's lots of polling that suggest he could win. But the Russians's calculus at this moment may be that if you want to keep Donald Trump in office, Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to go do that. Gotcha. Now, that then raises the question, why would they continue to support Trump? And I think the answer to that is that Donald Trump is the only member of the Trump administration who doesn't sign on to the anti-Russian cast of American policy.  Official policy is, we push back on the Russians from Ukraine to the Middle East and so forth. Donald Trump doesn't want to hear any of that. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia and a very good chance ” a very good relationship with President Putin. I would hope ” Putin, obviously, likes that. That's right. Official policy is we continue sanctions on the Russians. A lot of people say having Russia ” which is a power ” having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G7 that felt that way. And we didn't take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it. My inclination is to say, yes, they should be in. Donald Trump's been talking to the French about letting Russia back into the G8, the group of eight countries, and beginning to lift sanctions. Official policy is that we keep sanctions on as long as the Russians continue to annex Crimea. You know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that also. Donald Trump's view is, why do we care about Crimea anyway? Why don't the other neighbors care about that? So they have all kinds of reasons to believe that Donald Trump in the second term would be a continuation of the Donald Trump in the first term, who wasn't going to give them a hard time about their territorial or nuclear ambitions. OK, that's the Trump side of this. What makes the Russians convinced that Sanders is the most beatable Democrat? Because as you said, that's not exactly what the polling suggests. It isn't what the polling suggests, and it's an interesting question why they believe that. Remember, the Russians didn't think Donald Trump was going to win early in the last presidential cycle and really only came to supporting him in an active way in the very last months of the campaign. So they may not know right now any more than we know. Why would they know? Mm-hmm. You know, when Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? But they look at Bernie Sanders, and they see somebody who talks in ways that other American politicians rarely do. How many other American politicians have come out and said admiring things about Fidel Castro? Mm. You know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. How many other American candidates have proudly called themselves democratic socialists? So they think that all of these things make Sanders vulnerable to the charge from President Trump that Sanders is actually the Russian-loving socialist in the race. OK, so what is the third explanation for why Russia would support both candidates? Well, the third explanation is life is uncertain, and they could live with Bernie Sanders. Hmm. And why? Today, we are preparing to send soldiers to Afghanistan who were not even born on September 11, 2001. Because, like Donald Trump, he's got a real aversion to interventions around the world. We have got to stop endless wars. We have got to cut military spending. So that you can pay for Medicare for All and other social programs. So the thinking is that Russia would be quite happy, maybe even elated, with four more years of Donald Trump. But if they're going to have to live with a Democratic president, they're perfectly fine with Bernie Sanders. Especially because the Democrats have become the party of anti-Russia sentiment. Hmm. Right? It's almost a flip from what we thought about in the post-Cold War era where the Democrats were all about integrating Russia into the world community, making them part of the G8, coming up with economic packages, turning them into a European nation. Remember all that? Mm-hmm. You haven't heard a word of that from any of the Democrats now except Sanders. And so you're now seeing Bernie Sanders just in the past few days ” And what I say to Mr. Putin ” if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections. Senator ” ” begin to try to sound a bit tougher in his international relations views, precisely because he recognizes this is a big vulnerability. Mr. Putin is a thug. He is an autocrat. He may be a friend of Donald Trump's. He's not a friend of mine. Let me tell you ” So right now, we still don't have the evidence. Remember, in the 2016 election, it wasn't until 2017 ” really, after Donald Trump was about to be inaugurated ” that we got a sense of the scope of the Russian effort. Mm. What we do know is that Bernie Sanders now has a Russia problem. Mm. And that problem, if anything, is probably going to drive him to sound more hostile to Moscow than he naturally would be or he has been in the past. And how does that serve Russia? I'm not sure it does. Because once influence operations are exposed, it can drive the intended target ” in this case, Bernie Sanders and his supporters ” to the opposite corner. Mm-hmm. So you know, Donald Trump today is the last politician in America who could actually get behind lifting sanctions against Russia, because everybody would say, you're in Putin's pocket. And they run the risk of driving Bernie Sanders from the candidate who wanted to go talk to the Russians, to the candidate who could never talk to the Russians. Hmm.  Thank you, David. Thank you. This is ” Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you into this conversation. Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders? During Tuesday night's Democratic debate in South Carolina, candidates repeatedly invoked Russia's support for Trump and Sanders, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying that Russia favored them because they represent political extremes. I'll tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos. And chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. At one point, Mike Bloomberg turned to Sanders and declared that the reason Russia supported Sanders was because its government believed that Sanders would lose to Trump. Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States. And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you'll lose to him. Oh, Mr. Bloomberg! Sanders, in response, denounced Russia's efforts to meddle in the election. And let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, trying to bring Americans against Americans ” hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not gonna interfere in any more American elections. For highlights and analysis of that debate, listen to this morning's episode of The Latest. You can find it on the Daily Feed or by searching for The Latest wherever you listen. We'll be right back.  Here's what else you need to know today. Now, it's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will become infected. On Tuesday, health officials warned that the coronavirus will almost certainly begin spreading across the United States and that Americans should begin preparations now. During a news conference, Doctor Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that an American outbreak might require a wide range of actions, from closing schools to asking employees to work from home. We will be transparent with the public about these measures and the potential that these tools will be necessary. There is literally a playbook for the use of these tools. As of Tuesday night, the U.S. had 57 confirmed cases of the virus, all of whom are in isolation in hospitals. That's it for The Daily. I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. The House briefing was a supposed to be a repeat of an unremarkable classified session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in January and to inform lawmakers about a broad range of election threats, not just Russian interference. But lawmakers focused on the disclosures about Russia's support for Mr. Trump and challenged the briefer, Shelby Pierson, the nation's election security czar. Intelligence officials disputed that Ms. Pierson said that Russia was actively aiding the re-election of the president. She did say Russia was seeking to influence American elections, including the primaries. But people who heard the briefing said that the intelligence officers presenting the material said, in response to questions from lawmakers, that Russia was trying to get Mr. Trump re-elected. Republicans have disputed that Russia supports Mr. Trump, insisting that Mr. Putin simply wants to broadly spread chaos and undermine the democratic system. They have also argued that Mr. Sanders's gestures of peace toward the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War might make him appealing to Mr. Putin. But some current and former officials expressed doubt that Russian officials think that Mr. Sanders has a hidden affinity for Moscow. Instead, they said that a Russian campaign to support Mr. Sanders might ultimately be aimed at aiding Mr. Trump. Moscow could potentially consider Mr. Sanders a weaker general election opponent for the president than a more moderate Democratic nominee, according to two people familiar with the matter. The Washington Post first reported the briefing of the Sanders campaign. The campaign sought to pin the blame for the disclosure on the Trump administration, suggesting it was retribution for critical remarks Mr. Sanders had made about Mr. Grenell in 2018. Russia also worked to support ” or at least not harm ” Mr. Sanders in 2016. Operatives at a Russian intelligence-backed troll factory were instructed to avoid attacking Mr. Sanders or Mr. Trump, according to the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and an indictment he secured of 13 Russians working on the operation. Both the indictment and Mr. Mueller's report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency ordering operatives to attack Hillary Clinton's campaign. Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump ” we support them, the document said. Russian operatives used the troll factory in 2016 to pose on social media as Americans and sow divisions among already divisive issues like immigration, religion and race. It was one part of the Kremlin's multipronged attack on the election that also included hackings of Democratic emails, payments to unsuspecting Americans to stage pro-Trump rallies in battleground states and at least one scouting trip to the United States in 2014. Mr. Sanders said the Russians were again trying to interfere in the race. Some ugly stuff on the internet had been attributed to his campaign that could be coming from falsified accounts, he said. His online army of supporters is both coveted by his rivals and a source of complaints because of what they say is abusive behavior online. During the Democratic debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders suggested that Russian trolls may be responsible for the some of the worst of the postings. All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up, he said. I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me. Julian E. Barnes reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from Las Vegas.

By The New York Times,2/21/2020,nytimes,Coronavirus Outbreak Deepens Its Toll on Global Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/business/coronavirus-global-business.html,"A loss of $29 billion in airline revenue. China auto sales down by 92 percent. Interruptions for Procter & Gamble's 387 suppliers in China. As the coronavirus outbreak rattles the global economy and disrupts supply chains, international companies across nearly every industry are confronting a stark reality: Business will not go on as usual. And investors have taken notice. U.S. stocks fell for the second-straight day on Friday. Shares of energy, airline and technology companies led the broader market lower on Wall Street, as the S&P closed more than 1 percent lower, putting it on pace for its worst day of the month. Oil and gas prices also fell, with the price of a barrel of benchmark American crude slipping nearly 1 percent. The markets have become more volatile since the outbreak, but American investors have largely shrugged off the threat. Since Jan. 7, when Chinese officials identified the virus, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3 percent, even after this morning's sell-off. ” Matt Philips The International Air Transport Association this week warned of a deep downturn in earnings among global carriers related to the collapse of travel in Asia because of the virus. The virus outbreak could reduce global airline revenue by about $29 billion in this year, resulting in a small industry contraction compared with 2019, it said. Virtually all of the losses are expected to hit airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, which are facing a 13 percent decline in passenger demand for the year, according to the association's analysis. Some airlines have begun to acknowledge the outbreak's effects, with Air France-KLM Group and Australia's Qantas Group separately warning on Thursday of a potential financial hit. Qantas said that the coronavirus could reduce its profit for the fiscal year that ends June 30 by $66 million to $99 million, while Air France-KLM estimated a hit to earnings of as much as $216 million between February and April this year. More than 20 international airlines have suspended or restricted routes that end in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, and other major Chinese cities.",business

China reported 889 new cases of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, a sharp jump from the 394 fresh cases it reported on Thursday. South Korea has implemented emergency measures after it confirmed 100 new cases on Friday and a second death, while cases in Japan have now risen to 727. Concerns over the impact to supply chains and a lack of action by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ” a group of 14 of the world's major oil-exporting nations ” to cut production in response to a forecast of weakening oil demand sent oil prices lower . Brent crude fell 1.5% to $58.42 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped 1.5% to $53.07, having closed higher on Thursday for a seventh consecutive day. CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said the market had initially expected a quick rebound in demand but sentiment was now changing. The oil and gas sector is an early underperformer [on Friday] as oil prices slip back on rising concern that the early optimism for a quick rebound in demand as concerns about coronavirus diminish may well have been premature. UBS analyst Jon Rigby cut his 2020 oil price forecasts over the effects of the COVID-19 virus and now expected brent crude to reach $56 per barrel in the first quarter, down from a previous estimate of $62, and WTI to drop to $51. COVID-19 has added a new negative dimension to oil markets. It is early days but at the very least first-quarter oil demand will see a dramatic fall in China as economic activity grinds to a halt, and likely spillover effects onto global activity. However, he expected OPEC to respond with lower quotas in March and demand to rebound in the final three-quarters of 2020 ” with brent crude prices moving back up to $64 in the fourth quarter.

Carly Read,2/21/2020,express,Sadiq Khan admits he's been texting unlikely ally Sajid Javid “ Not my enemy',https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1245710/sadiq-khan-news-london-mayor-sajid-javid-chancellor-labour-tories," Mr Khan said the ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer gets his argument on the Mayoral contest between himself, Shaun Bailey and Rory Stewart. He also said he and Mr Javid have been texting and that they are in fact friends. He told the London Evening Standard: What people don't realise is your political opponent doesn't need to be your enemy. Sure, we've got different politics and I want his team to lose every time. He then refused to reveal the details of the text exchanges but added he was proud of Mr Javid. Referring to the new Chancellor Mr Sunak, he added: When people say that Rishi makes a point far more quickly and pithily than Saj does in Cabinet, well you know that's a form of prejudice. Mr Sunak was educated at Winchester and Oxford, while Mr Javid attended a state comprehensive near Bristol. Mr Khan and Mr Javid have a similar back story, as both of their fathers were bus drivers. Mr Khan was a middle child in a family of ten who shared bunk beds with his many brothers and sisters.   Speaking of his childhood, he said: We've got fond memories, but it was tough. We had one heater in the front room, where, when we had a bath, we would all have to dry off. Mr Khan will go head-to-head with Mr Bailey and Mr Stewart to keep his role as Mayor of London.

Casey Newton,2/21/2020,theverge,Bloomberg's debate performance shows that Facebook ads will only get you so far,https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/21/21145639/bloomberg-debate-performance-facebook-advertising,"As of Tuesday, Michael Bloomberg had spent $233 million on digital and television ads. This spending purchased him, according to an impressive visualization from the Washington Post, 30,000 digital ads a minute. The billionaire candidate for the Democratic nomination has spent more on advertising than every other Democratic candidate combined. Bloomberg has also spent much more than President Trump, who has invested a relatively paltry $19 million in digital and TV ads. One view of the 2016 election is that it was won by the candidate who had the superior mastery of Facebook ” Trump, whose campaign did a now-legendary job of creating and iterating on direct-response ads that built up his email list and donor rolls while also continuously serving up red meat to his fan base. If you hold that view, you might look at Bloomberg's campaign and wonder if this cycle's Facebook power user and assume he was about to walk away with the nomination. Bloomberg's spending raised concerns among more progressive Democrats, who worried that a general election in which two extremely wealthy men competed against one another largely on the basis of their spending power represented another step down the road to authoritarian plutocracy. These concerns were amplified by Bloomberg's shameless use of influencer marketing, which ” thanks to Facebook's rather confused rules on the subject ” arguably allows him to skirt transparency and fact-checking requirements. All of which made Wednesday's Democratic debate, in which Bloomberg squared off against his rivals for the first time, feel like a critical moment. Would this be the stage on which Bloomberg, flush with cash and dominating social platforms and TV advertising, steamroll his rivals? It would not be. Bloomberg hammered, read the headline in ... Bloomberg. Here are (brave!) reporters Craig Gordon and Gregory Korte: He spent most of the debate on the defensive, from attacks by Warren but also moderates Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar who all took turns taking swipes at the former mayor. He was too busy defending his record to talk it up much, and there were only flashes of the straight-talking candidate familiar to New Yorkers who made him mayor three times, when he was a Republican who won in the heavily Democratic city. It was the first time many Americans saw Bloomberg live on a debate stage, and not just in his ubiquitous television ads on which he has spent more than $400 million, a record in a presidential campaign. There was a wide gap between the smooth, confident candidate portrayed in those ads and the less sure-footed and at times irritable candidate on the debate stage. Let me finish, he said several times as the debate intensified. What am I, chicken liver? he added when he couldn't get attention from the moderators. It was indeed the opinion of the other candidates on stage, and possibly the moderators, and definitely the people I happened to be watching the debate with, that Bloomberg was chicken liver. This opinion was heightened by what BuzzFeed characterized, accurately, as savage takedowns from the other Democrats. (The takedowns on Twitter were, as you may have seen, even more savage.) Of course, it's all just talk until the next primary, which is set for Saturday in Nevada, and which Sen. Bernie Sanders is favored to win. But the real test will come March 3rd ” Super Tuesday ” when 14 states hold primaries. National polls suggest that Sanders is in the lead. It seems increasingly plausible that after March 3rd, Sanders will be the presumptive nominee ” and the entire story about Bloomberg, platforms, and money will be a footnote in history. Which isn't to say that platforms won't play a big role in the election. Political consultants I've spoken with say they are likely to play an outsized role, particularly in how less informed voters ” think white working class men in the Midwest ” get their news. But after this week's events, if Michael Bloomberg is to play a role, it seems increasingly likely that it won't be as a candidate. Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms. Trending up: TikTok rolled out a series of videos where influencers encourage people to get off their phones and go outside. It shows that TikTok is trying to avoid some of the mistakes of certain other highly addictive social apps. Trending down: The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has opened an investigation into Google for pregnancy discrimination against an employee. The employee said her supervisor made discriminatory remarks against pregnant women and that the company retaliated against her with poor performance reviews. β­ Russia is interfering in the 2020 US presidential election, intelligence officials say. And you'll never guess who they've endorsed! Here are Adam Goldman, Julian E. Barnes, Maggie Haberman and Nicholas Fandos in the New York Times: Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, in a disclosure that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him. β­ Twitter is experimenting with adding brightly colored labels directly beneath lies and misinformation posted by politicians and public figures. The move is part of a new policy to target misinformation, which the company plans to roll out on March 5th, reports NBC's Ben Collins. We'll see! In this version, disinformation or misleading information posted by public figures will be corrected directly beneath the tweet by fact-checkers and journalists who are verified on the platform, and possibly other users who will participate in a new community reports feature, which the demo claims is like Wikipedia. [...] The demo features bright red and orange badges for tweets that have been deemed harmfully misleading, in nearly the same size as the tweet itself and prominently displayed directly below the tweet that contains the harmful misinformation.

Chanel Georgina,2/21/2020,express,High blood pressure symptoms: Nosebleeds could be a sign of the deadly condition,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1245391/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-signs-nosebleeds," High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, describes the extreme force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels. Potentially life-threatening, there's one sign you shouldn't ignore. The British Heart Foundation state people with high blood pressure usually feel fine. But don't let that fool you, if you're suffering from nosebleeds, it could signal you have the deadly condition. The charity reports: More than one in four adults within the UK have high blood pressure. But many will not know they have it. The trouble with high blood pressure is that it damages artery walls. This, in turn, can cause tiny tears in the artery walls whereby bad cholesterol forms plaques (sticky deposits). This process is medically known as atherosclerosis. These fatty deposits clog your arteries, reducing the amount of blood flow “ full of oxygen and nutrients “ that can reach different organs within the body. READ MORE: Type 2 diabetes: Three of the best foods to eat for breakfast to lower blood sugar  As a result, high blood pressure can lead to various health complications. High blood pressure can lead to coronary heart disease (plaques in the artery walls). It can also cause angina “ chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Additionally, it can lead to chronic kidney disease “ among other consequences.

Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]How to get rid of visceral fat: Why this popular food may reduce the dangerous belly fat [TIPS] With symptoms, such as nosebleeds, so easy to dismiss as insignificant, it's important to really take notice of what your body is trying to tell you. The British Heart Foundation lists other likely symptoms of high blood pressure. Blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness and headaches are all possible symptoms of the health condition. The most effective way to get on top of your health is to have a health check-up at your local GP's surgery.  The GP can measure your blood pressure to determine whether or not you suffer from this dangerous illness. People between the ages of 40 to 74 receive an NHS Health Check invitation every five years, which does check for hypertension “ among other illnesses. However, you can request a blood pressure test at any point. Should there be a high blood pressure reading, your GP will give you advice on how best to manage the condition.   Known risk factors that contribute to high blood pressure have been noted down by the NHS. Smoking, regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol and lack of exercise are three huge risk factors for developing high blood pressure. Other known causes include long-term sleep deprivation, a high amount of salt in your food, and a family history of high blood pressure. Other underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, can also contribute to high blood pressure.

Chris Markoch,2/21/2020,marketbeat,"Deere Stock is Soaring, But is it Time to Pump the Brakes?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/deere-stock-is-soaring-but-is-it-time-to-pump-the-brakes/,"Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) was surging on February 21 after an earnings report that crushed expectations on the top and bottom lines. DE stock was up over 9% and trading at over $181 per share. The rally has pushed the stock into positive territory in 2020 for the first time since early January. Positive earnings reports can be a catalyst for stocks and DE is no different. For the company's first-quarter of fiscal 2020, Deere reported sales of $6.53 billion. While this was substantially higher than the FactSet estimate of $6.22 billion, it was 6% less than the same quarter in 2018. However, the story was better when it came to the company's profit. Deere reported net income of $517 million which comes out to $1.63 per share. This was higher than the FactSet estimate for $1.27 per share. And it also was higher on a year-over-year basis. In the same quarter for fiscal 2019, the company posted a $1.54 EPS on net income of $498 million. Investors are encouraged for a couple of reasons. First, as Deere CEO John C. May echoed in his remarks this could be a sign of U.S. farmers having renewed confidence as the U.S. and China have come to a Phase One deal in trade talks. The second reason for investor optimism is that Deere's first fiscal quarter is typically its worst of the year. Deere did not increase its full-year guidance One cause for concern is that Deere management is continuing to forecast a decline in net sales for its agriculture and turf sector as well as its construction sector. In the earnings report, agriculture and turf net sales were down 4% YoY and the company expects a 5%-10% decline in 2020. document.write('<a style=""text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal;color:#696969;"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.ame' + 'ricanconsumernews.net/scripts/click.aspx?NativeDisplayAdID=590&ImpressionID=0&UserID=0&Placement=PlaceOnArticlePage"">');5G phones cost a staggering $1,300. If you plan on buying one anytime soon¦ I got some news for you. It's a worthless investment. 5G won't work, unless this one tiny company steps in with its miraculous solution to save it. That's according to E.B. Tucker. He's a serial tech investor who made 13,000% in just 12 months ” on one tech trade. E.B. believes the tiny company that'll save 5G is the biggest stock market story for 2020. The situation is similar in the construction sector. Sales were down 10% YoY and Deere is projecting a 10%-15% decline in net sales for fiscal 2020. China continues to project uncertainty As 2019 was coming to a close, the optimism for stocks like Deere and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was palpable. The conventional wisdom was that the Chinese were looking for a deal just as badly as U.S. farmers. While that may be true, China still is presenting uncertainty for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty as it is. Yes, the outbreak and subsequent quarantines resulting from the coronavirus is a headwind on many U.S. companies. While it appears Caterpillar may be ready to reopen its Chinese manufacturing facilities, it's much too early to know what the capacity restraints will be due to the virus. However, as it relates specifically to DE stock, a more pressing concern may be a different virus. China has been dealing with a severe outbreak of African Swine Flu (ASF) since August 2019. The country has cut roughly 25% of its pork production. For a country that is the largest consumer of pork, this may be good news for U.S. pork producers but may be not as much for farmers. China is diversifying And that's because an unintended consequence of the trademark, according to Fortune magazine, is that China is discovering that diversification of sources is the key to its food security. Darin Friedrichs, senior Asia commodity analyst at INTL FCSTONE in Shanghai states, Agriculture is one of those things that the U.S. side really has to address¦basically over the past year and a half, China has been really aggressive in trying to diversify where (it's) buying from. This is being reflected most acutely in the country's soybean crop. Farmers that were expecting a huge tailwind from the Phase One deal are finding that China is less dependent on the United States for that commodity. And, with the outbreak of ASF, they have less need for soybeans to feed pigs. Deere Stock May be Overvalued DE stock posted a positive gain of over 15% in 2019. However, the stock lagged behind the S&P 500 index. Investors are watching closely for any signs of a rebound in the segment. In January, an analyst from Forbes projected a $168 price target for DE stock. That was based on the lower projections for revenue in the company's various segments. Since the company has not changed that outlook, a question will be if analysts change their outlook on earnings. Prior to earnings, analysts were forecasting a full-year EPS of $11.02, which would be a 27% increase from 2019. Deere was holding a conference call to review the earnings report at 10:00 a.m. on February 21. Although uncertainty in China may scare off growth investors, income investors can still look at Deere for its dividend. The yield is currently around 1.68%, but the company has a low payout ratio and with increased earnings, a dividend increase may be in the offing. 15 Stocks that Insiders Love An insider trade occurs when a corporate executive (such as a CEO, CFO or COO) that has non-public information about a company buys or sells shares of that company's stock. Company insiders are required by law to regularly report their stock purchases and sales to the SEC.Tracking a company's insider trades is a metric that can be used to identify the direction that the company's executives believes that the company is headed. If a number of insiders purchase more shares of their company, they may believe that the company will have strong future earnings and that the share price will increase in the near future.For example, if Microsoft's CEO, CFO and COO all recently purchased additional shares of Microsoft stock, that would be an indication that there could be unreported news that may positively effect Microsoft's stock price in the near future.This slideshow lists the 15 companies that have had the highest levels of insider buying within the last 180 days.

This makes me more concerned, since it's pretty clear that most of the market is not pricing in much risk yet.

When Coca-Cola (ticker: KO) reports first-quarter earnings in April, it now expects a two- to three-point hit to unit case volume, a one- to two-point hit to organic revenue, and a one- to two-penny impact on earnings per share. Still, the company maintained its full-year outlook, which forecasts organic revenue growth of 5%, adjusted earnings of $2.25 a share, capital expenditures of $2 billion, and free cash flow of $8 billion. Beyond spurring global uncertainty, the coronavirus outbreak has hit a number of U.S. companies with operations in China. Apple (AAPL) said earlier this week it would likely miss its March quarter sales outlook because of coronavirus' impact on manufacturing and retail in China. Procter & Gamble (PG) executives on Thursday cited supply and demand challenges spurred by the coronavirus, warning of a material impact on its March quarter earnings. For Coca-Cola, China is its third-largest market in terms of unit case volume, and the company said it expects further growth in the long term. The company plans to give further updates during its next earnings call in April. It said it's implemented precautionary measures to protect employees in China. Such efforts include providing face masks and hand sanitizers, installing temperature screening in offices and manufacturing facilities, and setting up health monitoring mechanisms across the system in China. Coca-Cola stock was flat at $59.76 Friday morning, while the S&P 500 index was down 1%. Coke shares have risen 8% in 2020 and were up 32% from a year ago”outpacing the market benchmark during both periods. ”Write to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com .",business

"David Culver, Yong Xiong, Natalie Thomas and Ben Westcott, CNN",2/21/2020,cnn,Shanghai is China's economic juggernaut. Coronavirus has left it a city on edge,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/asia/shanghai-coronavirus-china-economy-intl-hnk/index.html," On a normal weekend, Shanghai's world-famous Nanjing Road is packed with shoppers and tourists, keen to indulge themselves in China's thriving financial hub. But this week, the streets are mostly empty and stores are either closed or deserted due to fear of the deadly coronavirus , which has killed more than 2,000 people across the country. When a customer does enter a shop, the relieved store clerks rush  over to see if they can help -- but only after they have taken the newcomer's temperature. Yena Lei, a financial industry manager, said that Shanghai is usually quiet around the Lunar New Year holiday, when people take long breaks to be with their families, ""but not like this."" ""Now there's very few people,"" she said. ""You cannot go outside for anything, to meet with friends or have dinner or lunch. Everything is stopped."" Read More In recent days, Chinese state media has lauded the success of the country's authorities in containing the virus. On Monday, a meeting of top government officials presided over by Premier Li Keqiang declared that a "" greater outbreak "" had been avoided. State tabloid Global Times ran a series of articles announcing a ""slow, steady economic reboot"" after several weeks of disruption. On Tuesday, the number of patients discharged from hospitals exceeded new confirmed cases for the first time, state news agency Xinhua reported. But the upbeat tone in state media isn't being reflected on the ground in major cities such as Shanghai, where virus control measures are still having an impact on everyday life. A man wearing a protective face mask walks along the usually busy Bund waterfront along the Huangpu River overlooking Shanghai's financial district on February 6. 'Are you running a fever?' Shanghai has recorded 333 cases of the virus and two people have died. While those are relatively small numbers for a city of more than 27 million people, it is obvious to anyone visiting Shanghai that this is a city on edge. Eating out in Shanghai No experience has been as bizarre or depressing as eating out during this ""special time,"" which is how many locals have referred to life in China amid this outbreak. It took us six phone calls to find a restaurant that was open in Shanghai -- a normally bustling metropolis of some 25 million people. When we arrived all but one of three its entrances were locked. That forced everyone through one entrance where a security guard put a thermometer to our head and took our personal information: names, ID or passport numbers, phone numbers, and body temperature. When we finally entered the restaurant, we realized we were the only ones there. The host eagerly seated us, as the kitchen staff curiously looked on. Immediately after giving us menu, the server arrived and provided a sampling of hand sanitizer. He offered two types in case we had a preference. We handled the menu with purified hands and sanitized again after paging through the selections. When other diners arrived they were seated at opposite ends of the restaurant. The server explained their policy was only to serve three tables at a time. This restaurant had about 24 tables. When we finished our meal and asked for the check, the server insisted on bringing us a chocolate heart cake. It looked as though it had been prepared for Valentine's Day; it was February 16. As we left, the host thanked us repeatedly for coming in and apologized for the inconvenience. ""This is a 'special time',"" he told us. ""Please wish China well so we can get through this."" At the main train station terminal, guards in white hazmat suits instruct all arrivals to walk  in single file past a temperature reader secured to a tripod. After passing the checkpoint, visitors have to scan a massive QR code on their phones which brings up an online form. They are then asked, among other things, for their ID number and answer a range of questions: Where are you traveling from? Are you running a fever? Those unlucky enough to come from one of the most affected provinces will be put into quarantine at home for 14 days. Hotels in Shanghai are still barring guests from high-risk provinces, such as Guangdong and Hubei, where the epidemic began. Hotels are also implementing their own temperature checks, conducted by staff. ""It's the slowest I've ever seen it,"" a hotel manager, who wished to remain anonymous, said of the check in process at his establishment. ""But we should get through this 'special time,'"" he added with a smile. Shanghai Fashion Week, was supposed to take place from March 26 to April 2 , but has been canceled. Shanghai Disneyland has been shuttered since late January over fears of crowds of people rapidly infecting each other. Chemical industry worker Feng Ganggang, 23, came to Shanghai  from northeastern Shaanxi province over the Lunar New Year holiday. He said he couldn't believe how few people there were compared to when he came four years ago. ""Four years ago, it was packed. With so few people, it must be bad for the economy,"" he said. A man in Shanghai wears a mask amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, under a sign proclaiming ""open information, just and equitable."" Everyday Shanghai For Shanghai residents, life is far from normal. Many are still only able to access their residential compounds through one entrance, where they are funneled through a makeshift security checkpoint where their health and travel history is registered by a volunteer. Financial manager Lei said she went back to work on February 3, but  her team of 50 employees has been encouraged to work from home to stem the spread of the virus and take taxis rather than public transport. ""My company has taken a lot of measures to ensure people's safety,"" she said. ""(It's important) to make people feel comfortable rather than just force them to go back to work."" The Chinese government needs people to head to work. Some analysts have said that the coronavirus could cost China's economy up to 2% of economic growth -- or $62 billion. Empty streets in Shanghai's Hong Kou district amid ongoing coronavirus prevention measures. The economy was already facing headwinds due to the ongoing trade war with the US government, with growth in 2019 the weakest in three decades. Small businesses are one of the main drivers of China's domestic economy , but without help or a reprieve from the disease, the loss of customers and revenue may mean many have only weeks to survive. With Shanghai still struggling to get back on its feet, Lei said the Chinese economy could have a rocky year ahead, depending on how the next few months go. ""If you look at our stock market, it's still okay,"" she said. ""But the economic situation, I have to say, it will get worse, not immediately but maybe later ... Overall, I think this year will not be the year we had expected."" Even resuming normal habits is a struggle. Lei said she stopped going out to yoga after her local gym closed indefinitely. She has also had to cancel her travel plans around the country and abroad. Many major Chinese cities are still on lockdown and some countries, such as the US, have banned visits from Chinese citizens. ""Right now, there is nothing. We have to wait. And then we can see how it's going,"" she said.",general
Eamon Javers@EamonJavers,2/21/2020,cnbc,Trump plans 5G summit with global tech leaders in Huawei battle,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/trump-plans-5g-summit-with-global-tech-leaders-in-huawei-battle.html,"The Trump administration is planning a 5G summit at the White House in early April as part of its global effort to ensure that Chinese telecom giant Huawei does not become dominant in next generation communications technologies, officials told CNBC. The event has not been officially announced yet. The president's top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, told reporters Friday that such a meeting would happen. ""We're going to have a lot of them in the White House to have a discussion. I'm sure the president will join us in part. That would include Samsung, that would include all of our guys,"" Kudlow said. The development comes at a crucial moment for U.S.-Chinese relations. China, which is grappling with the coronavirus outbreak, last month signed a ""phase one"" trade deal with Trump as both sides look to complete additional phases. Behind the scenes, a senior administration official said telecom and technology CEOs have been visiting with President Donald Trump at the White House to explain their views on how to make sure that American firms continue to dominate the communications industry. Particularly influential in shaping White House thinking has been Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has discussed the issue face to face with Trump. ""We've been working with him,"" the senior administration official said of Smith. ""He spoke to POTUS about a month ago and they saw each other in Davos."" The input of Smith and other tech CEOs who have met with the president has helped shape an emerging view that the 5G issue is as much about software as it is about physical infrastructure. ""They're smarter than we are, and they're patriots,"" the official said of the CEOs. ""They want to help the U.S. be in the lead on 5G. Software and the cloud are going to revolutionize infrastructure."" The upcoming 5G summit is intended to gather information from the tech industry to help the White House press its case with allied countries that they should not allow Huawei equipment into their telecommunications networks. The administration fears that the Chinese government has installed ""back doors"" in the gear that will allow for spying on sensitive communications. Despite pressure from the U.S., the U.K. has decided to allow Huawei equipment in its 5G networks. The White House plans to invite foreign companies based in allied countries, including Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung, the official said. Attorney General William Barr suggested earlier this month that the United States should go as far as purchasing a controlling stake in Nokia and Ericsson in order to provide a safe harbor for non Chinese telecommunications equipment. But other officials within the White House quickly shot that idea down privately, worrying that it was inappropriate for taxpayers to buy large stakes in private firms.",finance

But while Uganda said last week that it would send $61,000 to students stuck in Wuhan, the Namusisi sisters have received nothing so far. They survive on one meal a day of noodles or rice, their mother said. Other foods are now too expensive: one kilo of beef costs $13, one tomato a dollar. They are not alone.

"Elisa Anzolin, Angelo Amante",2/21/2020,reuters,First Italian dies of coronavirus as outbreak flares in north,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-italy/first-italian-dies-of-coronavirus-as-outbreak-flares-in-north-idUSKBN20F0UI,"An elderly man in the northern city of Padua has died after being infected with the coronavirus, becoming the first Italian victim of the disease, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said on Friday. Health authorities announced earlier in the day 15 cases of the virus in the wealthy northern region of Lombardy and two in neighbouring Veneto where Padua is located ” the first known cases of local transmission in the country. None of those infected were believed to have travelled to China, the epicentre of the new illness, and local authorities in Italy scrambled to contain the outbreak. Local media said the dead man was a 78-year-old from the small town of Vo' Euganeo who was hospitalised two weeks ago. Strict measures to create a health cordon around Vo' Euganeo (have been put in place), regional governor Luca Zaia wrote on Facebook. In neighbouring Lombardy, the government banned all public events and closed schools in several small towns southeast of Italy's financial capital Milan. We had prepared a plan in recent days, because it was clear what has happened could somehow happen, Health Minister Speranza told reporters as doctors tested hundreds of people who might have come into contact with the coronavirus sufferers. Speaking on the margins of a European Union meeting in Brussels before the Italian fatality was announced, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he would meet the chiefs of Italy's civil protection agency, and that the situation was under control. We were ready for this (outbreak) ... the people have no need to be worried, we will adopt increasingly severe and precautionary measures, he said. Local officials said the first infected patient in Lombardy, a 38-year-old man from the town of Lodi, fell ill after meeting a friend who had recently visited China. That man has since tested negative for the disease, but doctors were investigating whether he carried the virus and subsequently recovered without showing any symptoms, said Lombardy regional councillor Giulio Gallera. The pregnant wife of the initial patient and one of his friends were infected, along with three others admitted to hospital overnight suffering from pneumonia-like symptoms. Officials later said five health workers who had come into contact with the virus carriers had themselves fallen ill. Zaia said it was unclear how the two individuals in Veneto might have caught the disease. There was certainly no contact with the people infected in Lodi, he said. Prior to Friday, Italy had reported just three cases of the virus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Two Chinese tourists from Wuhan tested positive in Rome in late January, while an Italian who returned home on a special flight repatriating some 56 nationals from the same city was hospitalized a week later. After the first confirmed cases, Italy suspended all direct flights to and from China, provoking the ire of the Beijing government. Diplomatic and economic issues are fundamental but health comes first, Speranza said on Friday as he announced the government's latest measures. All those who have entered Italy after visiting areas in China affected by the coronavirus will have to stay home under surveillance, the health ministry said in a statement. China has had more than 75,400 cases of the coronavirus and 2,236 people have died, most of them in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan.

Elliot Smith@ElliotSmithCNBC,2/21/2020,cnbc,European stocks turn positive as upbeat data offsets coronavirus fears,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/european-stocks-set-for-muted-open-as-coronavirus-spreads.html,"European stocks closed lower on Friday afternoon, as investors monitored a raft of economic data and the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak. The pan-European Stoxx 600 fluctuated for much of the day but closed 0.6% lower, taking cues from poor sentiment over on Wall Street. The spread of a new strain of coronavirus was the main focus for investors, as the number of cases and deaths grew. China's National Health Commission said another 889 cases had been confirmed in the mainland, while the death toll rose by 118 to 2,236. China's commerce ministry said it expected the growth rate of January/February imports and exports to fall sharply due to blockages in logistics, delays in the resumption of work and other factors such as the Lunar New Year. In the U.S., stocks fell sharply on the new coronavirus cases, which fueled worries over a pronounced global economic slowdown. On the data front, business activity in the euro zone expanded more than expected this month, according to the latest figures. Euro zone composite flash PMI came in at 51.6 in February, up from 51.3 in January and beating forecasts, while manufacturing jumped to 49.1 from 47.9 in January, hitting a 12-month high and significantly exceeding analyst expectations of 47.5. For PMI data, 50 is the level that distinguishes expansion from contraction. U.K. businesses maintained solid growth in February as factories posted the biggest output rise for 10 months, so far unfazed by the supply chain disruption stemming from Chinese industrial shutdowns. U.K. composite PMI came in at 53.3 in February, beating the Reuters consensus forecast of 52.8. As for corporate news, Allianz reported an increase in net profit of 9.5% to 1.858 billion euros ($2.01 billion) ” a better-than-expected fourth-quarter result for the German insurer. Its stock closed around 1% higher. Pearson reported a 6% growth in operating profit to Β£581 million ($748.7 million) for 2019, slightly below its revised guidance, on the back of falling textbook sales in North America. The British education publisher's shares dropped 4.8%. Moneysupermarket shares fell 4.5%, close to the bottom of the European benchmark as investors seemingly cashed in on Thursday's price leap, while Proximus shed 5.7% after fourth-quarter results. At the top of the Stoxx 600, Sopra Steria surged 11% after announcing the acquisition of Sodifrance.",finance
Elliot Smith@ElliotSmithCNBC,2/21/2020,cnbc,Pimco-owner Allianz posts profit beat and hikes 2020 guidance,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/pimco-owner-allianz-posts-profit-beat-and-hikes-2020-guidance.html,"Allianz posted a better-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter net profit on Friday, and raised its 2020 guidance. Quarterly net profit came in at 1.86 billion euros ($2 billion), up 9.5% from the same period last year, with full-year 2019 operating profit hitting 11.9 billion euros, in the upper end of the German insurer's target range. The company said its increase in operating profit was driven primarily by higher assets under management at U.S. investment manager Pimco, thanks to ""strong market effects"" and net inflows. This prompted Allianz to hike its operating profit target to 12 billion euros for 2020, up 4.3% from previous guidance. However, the group had to set aside 600 million euros in reserves to prop up its struggling corporate business, causing its property and casualty division to miss expectations. Allianz CFO Giulio Terzariol told CNBC on Friday that this was a ""disappointment,"" but added that the combined ratio ”a measure used by insurers, with readings below 100 indicating profitability ” for the division was ""very stable."" In the fourth quarter, the combined ratio slipped by 5.5 percentage points to 99.6%. The company is targeting a combined ratio of 93% by the end of 2021. Terzariol added that the company had made progress on productivity and this year and next would see further focus on restoring profitability in the industrial business. Allianz also announced plans to extend its share buyback program by another 1.5 billion euros. Terzariol told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the buyback program was essential to maintaining capital discipline within the group. ""It's more about efficient capital deployment, and if you see we have achieved in 2019 an ROE (return on equity) of 13.6%, our earnings per share compared to the level of 2016 are up double-digits, and clearly this is a consequence of good operating performance but also of discipline in capital management, and buybacks are very essential to preserve this discipline in capital management,"" he said Terzariol also acknowledged that the group was seeing a slowdown in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, but did not expect a material impact on the wider group numbers.",finance
Emily Bary,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Dropbox stock surges toward best day on record as bulls say profit focus is a turning point,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dropbox-stock-surges-toward-best-day-on-record-as-bulls-say-profit-focus-is-a-turning-point-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"Dropbox shares are surging toward their best single-day performance on record on Friday as bulls say the stock has finally hit a turning point. The cloud-storage company initially got a warm reception from Wall Street when it came public in early 2018, but the stock has languished in recent months amid questions about subscriber momentum . Now the stock is on track to close above its initial-public-offering price of $21 for the first time since September after the company delivered quarterly earnings and forward-looking commentary that Deutsche Bank's Karl Keirstead called potentially thesis-changing. Shares DBX, +4.04% are up about 18% in Friday morning trading. Among the highlights for analysts was Dropbox's decision to raise its operating-margin and free-cash outlook for 2020 and over the long term. Bottom line, the narrative that Dropbox had material operating leverage potential was a key part of the bull case at the time of the IPO but simply hasn't played out since then, as 2019 turned into an investment year, wrote Keirstead, who has a buy rating and $30 target price on Dropbox shares. Investors are likely to welcome this change in tone, especially with Dropbox arguing that it is not coming at the expense of top-line growth. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill also said that the biggest surprise for him was Dropbox's new operating margin forecast, with the company now targeting 28% to 30% compared with a prior range of 20% to 22%, but he's less confident that the company won't be sacrificing top-line potential to get there. [W]e remain cognizant of the balance between growth and profitability, Thill wrote. The lack of growth catalysts keep us at Hold. He has a $21 price target on the stock, up from $19 before the report. Canaccord Genuity's Richard Davis, an exasperated bull on Dropbox's stock , hoped that this latest report will make bears relent. I can't recall a time in over 20 years during which investors so disdained good execution for so long, wrote Davis, who said that the company's results were solid on just about every metric he looks at. It is difficult to break momentum in software stocks in either direction, but perhaps today's news is the first sign of a sustainable rally. Davis added that while Dropbox is certainly not perfect, its stock looks cheap on any metric that we can come up with. He rates the stock a buy with a $30 target price. Opinion: The 5G rollout is already behind, and coronavirus could slow it even more Still, the report wasn't enough to sway Bernstein's Zane Chrane, a bear on the stock. While [average revenue per user] is growing from price hikes and a shift to higher value products, our concern is that these may be less sustainable drivers of revenue growth than if sub[scriber] adds were consistent, he wrote. As for the company's new long-term margin targets, he wrote that the move comes less than five months after Dropbox last gave a forecast on the metrics at its analyst day. The timing & magnitude of the change (and the [share repurchase authorization]), leads us to wonder if the company was under pressure from potential activists, Chrane wrote. He has an underperform rating on the stock but bumped his price target up by a buck, to $19. Even with Friday's rally, shares are off 13% over the past 12 months as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% has risen 20%.",business
Eric J. Savitz,2/21/2020,marketwatch,San Francisco Tech Events Suffer as Coronavirus Fears Spread,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/san-francisco-tech-events-suffer-as-coronavirus-fears-spread-51582329831,"Facebook has canceled its planned participation in the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Photograph by Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images All of a sudden, people are treating San Francisco like a suburb of Wuhan, China. While the City by the Bay is more than 6,400 miles away from the city at the heart of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, the technology industry appears to be in freak-out mode over the perceived risk of mixing with peers at large-scale events. In the latest development, both Facebook (ticker: FB) and
        Sony (SNE) have now canceled their planned participation in the Game Developers Conference, which is scheduled for March 16-20 at the Moscone Center. They cited the usual reasons, an abundance of caution in the face of the spreading virus. Those are a pair of big hits for the GDC”Facebook makes Oculus virtual-reality headsets, and Sony, of course, makes PlayStation game consoles. And if you think those are the last cancellations, you are more optimistic than would seem logical. Verizon Communications (VZ) on Friday pulled out of the RSA Conference , following the previous withdrawal of both IBM (IBM) and AT&T (T). The conference kicked off this weekend in the same location, the Moscone Center. As of Friday, according to a post on the RSA website , 14 exhibitors have canceled, including six from China, seven from the U.S., and one from Canada. Facebook also recently canceled a planned marketing conference that had been scheduled for March 9-12 at the Moscone Center. All of that follows the collapse of Mobile World Congress , the big mobile-phone conference that was supposed to start this weekend in Barcelona, after dozens of companies, many based in the Bay Area, canceled plans to attend, exhibit, or sponsor the show. In an open letter to RSA participants today , San Francisco Mayor London Breed writes that San Francisco is open for business and events are proceeding as planned. She adds that the risk of infection in San Francisco is low, as the virus is not circulating in our community. That's true as far as it goes. But 53 miles away in Fairfield, Calif., some travelers are being quarantined at Travis Air Force Base , according to media reports, and at least one person who tested positive for the virus there is being treated in an unnamed San Francisco hospital . The University of California at San Francisco hospital recently treated two coronavirus patients . Another is being treated in Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa, about 50 miles to the north. There have been at least two cases diagnosed in Santa Clara County , home of tech companies like Facebook, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Intel (INTC), and one has been hospitalized in Sacramento , about 90 miles east of San Francisco. In her open letter, Mayor Breed writes that the best way to stay healthy and avoid spreading the virus is to practice common-sense behaviors like hand washing and staying home when sick. But more people seem to think the best practice is simply to stay home, sick or otherwise. Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com",business
Eric J. Savitz,2/21/2020,marketwatch,How AT&T Is Transforming Itself for a Future of 5G and Streaming,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/how-at-t-is-transforming-itself-for-a-future-of-5g-and-streaming-51582304975,"AT&T's John Stankey is sitting on the couch in his stunning corner office on the 46th floor of a new tower in Manhattan's trendy Hudson Yards complex, high above the far West Side. The space has a spectacular view of the Hudson River and the New Jersey river towns beyond. The odor of fresh carpeting hangs in the air. Stankey, arms stretched over the back of the couch, appears remarkably, almost unreasonably, composed. An AT&T (ticker: T) lifer who joined the company in 1985, Stankey has two huge and relatively new jobs. In June 2018, with the completion of the $108 billion Time Warner acquisition, Stankey became CEO of WarnerMedia, the restructured and renamed entertainment conglomerate. With a portfolio that includes HBO, CNN, TBS, TNT, Warner Bros., and Cartoon Network, Stankey instantly became one of the world's most powerful media executives. Last fall, he also was named AT&T's president and chief operating officer, adding responsibility for the company's communications and advertising businesses, and making him the clear heir apparent to CEO Randall Stephenson. Lately, Stankey is gearing up for the May 2020 launch of HBO Max, the company's new entry into the intensely competitive market for subscription-based streaming services”and the core of AT&T's revamped content strategy. In his free moments, Stankey is steering Ma Bell's fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless rollout, streamlining AT&T's balance sheet, and prepping for his eventual promotion to the top job. We sat down with Stankey this week for an extended discussion on 5G, HBO Max, the fate of DirecTV, and a host of other topics. The excerpts below have been edited for space and clarity. On why 5G is going to be more important initially for businesses than for consumers: John Stankey: With 5G, we're going to revert to what used to be the norm in technology, when business applications came first and then flowed to consumers. In the early 2000s, that shifted, and consumer applications drove mass deployment, and then benefits would flow to enterprises. With 5G, the dynamic is going to flip back, with the first meaningful applications enterprise-led, like distributed manufacturing floors that become automated through pervasive sensors and control mechanisms driven by 5G networks. On why he's not that worried about the impact of the coronavirus on the 5G rollout: I've seen theories where the virus doesn't peak until April, and I've heard others who say the outbreak is peaking now. But the devices that will drive 5G mobile-phone adoption aren't even in factories yet, and won't be manufactured until weeks before they're brought to market. Assuming this thing passes by summer, I don't think there's going to be much impact. On whether AT&T”widely seen as the best-positioned U.S. carrier in terms of 5G spectrum”still needs more bandwidth: We will continue to be spectrum acquirers. Bandwidth consumption continues to increase. Things that consumers used to do at home”because that's where they got acceptable performance and throughput”they're now doing on the go. All of the carriers will continue to build additional capacity, and we'll continue to find places to add to our spectrum portfolio. On why AT&T wants to talk about content, not the various flavors of 5G: If you're talking to customers about the difference between millimeter wave versus sub six 5G networks, you've already lost. The speed and coverage you get doesn't matter once you've passed a certain threshold. I'd rather talk to consumers about something they have an emotional attachment to, rather than, I can give you 110 megabytes and they can give you 105. And that's why having content to marry to connectivity is important, because you're not going to be able forever to sell connectivity based on speed. On how buying Time Warner boosts AT&T's connectivity business: Customers will stop distinguishing between fixed and wireless connectivity. And then they're going to say, why else should I do business with you? I believe it will be through aggregation of entertainment-based services. We're talking about video today, but maybe tomorrow we add music, maybe a gaming subscription service, or some combination where I can get connectivity and I get something else with it. After we acquired Time Warner, we started offering HBO on top of our wireless services. Others are giving Netflix away for free. That trend continues. We're going to see these services reaggregate over time under a different distribution model. On why HBO Max will be a content platform, not just a subscription streaming service: It's about the strength of the platform to reach most U.S. households. To the extent that the platform is flexible enough to offer both subscription-based and advertising-based content, it's a natural place for additional services to show up. That's why HBO Max is such an important driver for our business”it is a high-value, low-priced service that we believe most U.S. households will want. It starts with a subscription video service. But we can add ad-supported services, as well. On the role of streamed advertising: First of all, we absolutely agree there needs to be a premium subscription-supported product that has no advertising. That will be the foundation of our platform. But our belief is that, over time, consumers will value depth and choice. And so we've said next year we'll introduce an AVOD [ad supported video on demand] component to the product. And that AVOD component will broaden the kind of content that's available, with a different monetization scheme. AVOD is not generating huge dollars. But look at Hulu. On a per-subscriber basis, there's quite good economics. They're using advertising in a different way, and that's not even the most sophisticated approach that can be achieved now with current technology and what we know about customers. So I do believe there is a place for ad-supported content moving forward. On offering a channel store on HBO Max, in competition with Roku, Amazon.com, and others:  It's hard to get an organization of this size with this much past success to do things differently. But that's what we've done.  ” John Stankey With HBO Max, we're going to establish a platform in most U.S. households that becomes a natural aggregation point. The difference is, we want to offer attractive economics for those services to come on the platform, so they can monetize their customers, as opposed to some of these egregious models of the dominant wireless OS providers [a reference to the Apple and Google app stores] that skim off the top and make it virtually impossible for anybody to make a buck. Or Roku's demands to take portions of ad inventory in exchange for the right to be on the platform”I don't think that's long term the attractive way. On the strategy around DirecTV, which is losing large numbers of subscribers: We didn't buy DirecTV because we loved satellite delivery. We liked the customer base. The play was to move most satellite customers to software-driven services. But we were later than we wanted to be on that product, AT&T TV, which launches in March. It is the satellite replacement product, the software-based service that allows us to modernize and bring a feature-rich customer pay-TV experience to the base, that is no longer dependent on satellite delivery. But If I had my wish, we would have been where we are right now over 18 months ago. On the future of basic cable networks: We're going to see cable networks thin out. What's going to be left will be those that have news, sports, and unscripted content. That's what stays in that pay-TV bundle and has longevity over time. Do I think those things will become add-on packages as part of a subscription platform? I do. On AT&T's own basic cable networks: Look, we're not Viacom with 18 channels. We're not Disney. We're successful in that business, but we're targeted. The bulk of our profitability there comes from CNN, which is news, and TNT and TBS, which have sports content along with general entertainment content. Then there's truTV, which is not a huge economic contributor. And Cartoon Network, which will end up part of HBO Max. (function () {

})(); On the National Football League, the Sunday Ticket offering, and the future of football broadcasting: As for what happens to NFL rights, you would have to ask the NFL. Originally, the NFL viewed Sunday Ticket as a premium offer, and chose not to make it widely available. Does the calculus change going forward? We're in a rapidly changing environment, and quite possibly it does. My sense is that all sports leagues realize that if they're not being more deliberate about how they distribute rights, they're going to miss some audience. Consider the National Basketball Association, which is quite popular with people in their 20s and 30s, who overindex on not being part of the traditional TV ecosystem. The NBA has to be thinking, do I want to only have my content available over cable, or should I be allowing my partners to make it available on other platforms? Will that undermine licensing revenues? Probably not. But I do believe we'll see alternatives as you get into renewal cycles. On the impact on AT&T from the Sprint/T-Mobile US deal: It really doesn't impact us. We're running the same plays today as we did a week ago. We're seeing momentum return in our subscriber growth. We're going to finish the work on 5G deployment. I understand why Sprint and T-Mobile got together. T-Mobile was looking at this transition to 5G, and they had basically no spectrum. Now, they have to bring the two businesses together and meld their portfolios. They're going to be in a better position once they get through it, but they've got work to do. We bought Time Warner because we wanted to offer consumers not just great connectivity, but also something else. That's our play. They're not doing that. They're going to figure out how to integrate cell sites and close down billing systems and do whatever they need to get economic efficiency. Our play is a great network, adding value with entertainment. On future competition from Dish: We'll see. I love [Dish CEO] Charlie Ergen dearly, but he's a very mercurial individual. Sometimes, the cards that he has on the table aren't always the cards that he ultimately ends up playing. I'm sure there'll be some surprises and twists and turns in whatever he does. On the company's three-year plan in response to recent pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, which includes selling assets and reducing debt, among other things: It's a nonissue at this point. We said we'd be at 2Β½ times debt to Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] by the end of 2019, and we delivered. AT&T often had three-year road maps but just didn't communicate them, to give us flexibility when unexpected things popped up. Elliott asked us to tell people what our plans were, and in some cases, they've asked us to think a bit more critically on how we're running the business. We're casting a careful eye over every part of our operation, assessing how we're positioned, thinking about whether we're going to offer competitive pricing, with new entrants in the market like Charlie, and continued incursions from Google and Amazon. That's a healthy process. I look at our operations and ask, are we as lean, as efficient, and as focused as we need to be? Three years from now, we will be a more-focused, more-tailored business than we are today because of portfolio rationalization, operational improvement, and product rationalization. That's a healthy process for a business with a long, storied history. On his future role at AT&T: I don't expect to occupy the WarnerMedia CEO role forever. This organization has gone through a lot of transitions over the past year. It wasn't an easy year, but the business is so much better positioned. As great as the Warner asset was, it wasn't configured the right way for this changing environment. Now, the business is positioned to respond to these trends. It's hard to get an organization of this size with this much past success to do things differently. But that's what we've done. Once that takes hold, it will be time for me to spend more time getting all of AT&T's parts to work better together. The communications company, the media company, the advertising company. That moment will come, I expect sometime in 2020. Many thanks, John. Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com",business
Eric Volkman,2/21/2020,fool,2 Stocks That Trounced the Market on Thursday,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/20/2-stocks-that-trounced-the-market-on-thursday.aspx,"We're very close to the weekend, which is good for the stock market because it needs a break. Most major indexes were down notably on Thursday; perhaps it's the lingering concern about the economic effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus, or the lack of inspiring news from many of the market's top stocks. Whatever the reason, it was a gloomy Thursday for many stock investors... unless they had some of their money in these two companies, which blasted past the market on an otherwise forgettable day. In yet another act of consolidation in the securities brokerage sector, E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) agreed to be acquired by white-shoe investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The all-stock deal is valued at $13 billion, or $58.74 per share. Since that's around 30% higher than E*Trade's Wednesday closing price, the stock shot up by almost 22% today. In retrospect, a buyout from a Morgan Stanley-sized bank was bound to happen sooner or later. The dominoes started to tumble in early 2017, when financial services giant Fidelity cut its commissions for securities trading by $3 to $4.95 per trade. This triggered a sporadic price-cut war, which culminated in most name brokerages -- E*Trade includedΒ -- eliminating such commissions entirely last year.  Compounding this for E*Trade is the fact that it was never a particularly standout performer in the sector. In contrast to some of its rivals, it struggled with profitability and growth over the years. And despite admirable attempts at diversification, it was still vulnerable to the disappearance of commission revenue. Due largely to this, the company's overall net revenue declined by 8% year over year in its most recently reported quarter -- and this, in the midst of a long-tail bull market for securities. Don't get me wrong, I think the death of securities trading commissions is a boon for us individual investors -- even though I'm invested in the brokerage sector (by owning shares of TD Ameritrade, itself a recent takeover, in its case by Charles Schwab). But with that revenue stream gone, this industry is now the patch of big boys like Morgan Stanley that can better absorb the loss. Regardless, congratulations to E*Trade shareholders on the buyout and resulting share price spike. Now this is how you close out a fiscal year. Online real estate broker Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z)(NASDAQ:ZG) saw both its share classes rise by around 17% on Thursday following the company's release of its Q4 of fiscal 2019 results. With housing prices being what they are, it's a good time to be in American real estate, and it's a good time to be a real estate broker. Fueled by Zillow's more direct involvement in this robust market, its revenue rose nearly 160% on a year-over-year basis to almost $944 million. The company's GAAP net loss deepened but not excessively -- it came in at $101 million ($0.49 per share) against the Q4 2018 deficit of nearly $98 million.  On average, analysts tracking the stock had much lower expectations. They were modeling only $815 million or thereabouts on the top line, and a per-share net loss of $0.57. The steep revenue growth was due almost entirely to a $560 million-plus improvement in the take for the company's ""homes"" segment. In this business, which was still a baby at this point last year, Zillow directly buys and sells residences. There's still growth to be had, assuming our housing market at least maintains its frothiness. Homes' core Zillow Offers service, in which homeowners can go on the company's site to receive direct bids for their residences, is operating in only 23 markets in 11 states across the country. On top of that, last year Zillow started entering into partnerships with homebuilders to serve clients wanting to go the new-residence route. The company's on a clear growth path -- only I'd caution that since the homes unit is past its embryonic stage, we probably won't see such grand revenue improvements as in Q4. Zillow's expenses are high, too, which is a key reason why it's landed in the red not only in this quarter, but in quarters past. Still, this company is well worth watching, and could be a good play for investors who are bullish on the durability of our housing market.",business
Eustance Huang@EustanceHuang,2/21/2020,cnbc,Ping An on coronavirus impact on China economy and business,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/ping-an-on-coronavirus-impact-on-china-economy-and-business.html,"A top executive at Chinese conglomerate Ping An Insurance says the coronavirus outbreak in China has in some ways been ""helpful"" for the business. ""This virus actually, it's been particularly helpful because we've suddenly had requests you know, (from) over 30 over banks and ... 20 over insurers whereby we provide our technology to help of them to get up back to work very quickly,"" Jessica Tan, co-CEO of Ping An, a Chinese insurance firm listed in Hong Kong. Speaking to CNBC on Friday, Tan said: ""What we see about the impact in virus, particularly in the first half, will definitely impact the economy. Of course, the financial services industry is less hit by the virus."" The global outbreak of COVID-19, most keenly felt in China and its Hubei province where most of the deaths and cases have occurred, has so far claimed more than 2,000 lives. It has impacted economies, especially those in Asia, as well as the outlook for large companies such as Apple. Investors are still struggling to grapple with the potential impact of the mysterious disease as China locked down cities and extended the Lunar New Year holiday for factories and schools, in order to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like virus. In a separate interview with Reuters, Tan appeared less upbeat and acknowledged that the current coronavirus situation is ""very challenging"" as the bulk of Ping An's business is driven ""primarily by agents."" ""There are guidelines that they can't visit customers,"" Tan told Reuters. ""We, as well as the rest of the industry, are trying to accelerate the transition to work in a new model whereby the agents are unable the visit the customers and yet you able to maintain your business."" During her interview with CNBC, Tan said Ping An was ""one of the few financial institutions that were able to get 1.4 million of our people, employees and agents, completely working online on 3rd of February,"" referring to the extended holiday period in China. ""That's something that very few people can do and we've been offering that to our financial services partners as well."" She also said that services in areas such as the firm's health technology and smart city businesses have seen ""huge demand"" during this period. Tan's comments came a day after Ping An posted earnings that missed expectations despite a more 39% surge in its 2019 net profit. The firm saw a net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company of about 149.4 billion yuan (approx. $21.27 billion) in the year ended Dec. 31, 2019. That compared to a figure of about 107.4 billion yuan (approx. $15.29 billion) the previous year. Still, that was lower than expectations of 157.6 billion yuan in a Refinitiv-compiled SmartEstimate based on a survey with analysts, according to Reuters. Ping An said in its 2019 annual report the virus has had ""certain impacts on the business operation and overall economy"" in certain areas or industries, including in Hubei province where the disease was first reported. ""This may affect the quality or the yields of the credit assets and investment assets of the Group in a degree, and the degree of the impact depends on the situation of the epidemic preventive measures, the duration of the epidemic and the implementation of regulatory policies,"" the report said. Speaking with CNBC on Friday, Tan said a recovery was expected in the second half of the year and the outbreak will likely pan out positively in the longer-term for Ping An's health insurance and tech businesses.",finance
Evelyn Cheng@chengevelyn,2/21/2020,cnbc,China starts to get back to work as leaders worry about people's jobs,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/china-starts-to-get-back-to-work-as-leaders-worry-about-peoples-jobs.html,"BEIJING ” While Chinese authorities try to control the spread of the new virus, they are moving quickly to stall its impact on the economy, especially on people's jobs. This past Tuesday, the powerful State Council decided at a meeting to waive some business' contributions to social insurance plans through June, and emphasized that ""stable employment"" must be a priority. These policy moves also come as the country begins a gradual return to work in manufacturing, technology and other major industries. The coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 people began spreading rapidly in mainland China in January ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday and forced more than half of the country to shut down for at least a week longer than planned. As of Thursday morning, about a third of 1,000 Chinese companies surveyed in the last week by research firm China Beige Book remain closed, and roughly another third are operating remotely. Workforces are losing more laborers than hiring, and wages are on the verge of contracting, the research firm's survey found, noting the trends were consistent regardless of industry or company size. China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that resumption of work in the country's top exporting province of Guangdong has been ""rapidly increasing,"" while key businesses in foreign trade in provinces such as Zhejiang and Shandong have a resumption of work rate of around 70%. But the ministry said Thursday it expected consumption will still be in a recovery period in the second quarter, indicating the scale of the virus' impact on the economy even if the disease is curbed by March. The high-level policy announcements come amid a flurry of local government policies to support privately run, smaller businesses, which account for the majority of jobs in China but operate in a state-dominated environment. One plan to reduce employers' contributions to workers' social security is expected to ease businesses' burden by a total 500 billion yuan ($71 billion), officials said Thursday. That's about one-fifth of the more than 2 trillion yuan in last year's tax and fee cuts. ""The original intent of the country is very good, and we hope all levels of government will fully implement these relief measures, and not take discounts, in order to really alleviate some of the impact of this (virus) on medium, small and micro-sized enterprises,"" a financial markets veteran in Beijing said, according to a CNBC translation. The individual asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. This (virus) has made it more difficult for private enterprises to survive (in an environment of widespread market and financing discrimination),"" the source said, describing the situation faced by smaller firms as ""hitting a tough point of life or death."" ""If private companies fail in a large number of outbreaks, the domino effect on the job market is extremely obvious."" Analysts have pointed out that the challenges to employment are greater now than during the SARS outbreak in 2003. Then, close to half of workers were in primary industries such as agriculture, while in 2018, 46% were in services, according to official data. This time, the virus' high level of contagion has prompted local governments to limit gatherings, resulting in empty or closed shopping malls and other service-heavy sectors. For their part, retailers are turning to online sales and delivery as a way to make up for the lack of crowded storefronts. In a report this week, analysts at S&P Global China painted a grim picture for restaurant, tourism and media and entertainment businesses. They forecast restaurant sales in the first quarter will likely be half what they were during the same period last year. Even if businesses aren't laying off workers, many people may not be getting paid as much or at all right now. To help employment, national-level officials at press conferences in Beijing in the last two weeks have announced a number of measures including increasing online recruitment, training subsidies and support for innovation-related industries. Government figures, which are frequently doubted, have reported an unemployment rate of near 5% or less for years. The longer-term effect of the virus on the national economy is less certain. While Chinese news headlines are scattered with references to business losses in the hundreds of thousands of yuan or more, financial analysts generally say the fundamentals of the world's second-largest economy remains intact. For example, an increase in bank loans to struggling smaller businesses at this time will likely increase the level of non-performing loans in the financial system. But if the virus comes under control around March and it's business as usual in April, then the problem isn't that great, especially since the direct impact is on services, not asset-heavy industries, pointed out Chen Xinyi, banking analyst at China Asset Management Company. She added that if the virus is under control by March, then the financing needs of manufacturing companies aren't that great. Commercial real estate services company JLL also expects demand for office space in China to be healthy over the next several years, Daniel Yao, head of research, JLL China, said in a phone interview on Thursday. For now, he said, there's a clear decline in market vitality, with a drop in property visits, contract signings and construction, and the uncertain environment is causing companies to be more conservative. Case in point: Hubei province, which is at the outbreak's center, had told businesses that Friday could be the earliest they could resume work. One night before, the government told businesses not to resume work before March 11. Here's a summary of some reports on resumption of work around the country: Beijing ” City officials said that as of 6 p.m. on Wednesday, large software and information services companies have a resumption of work rate of 86.9%, with many employees working remotely. The capital city's industrial companies with annual revenue of at least 20 million yuan from their primary business operations have resumed work at a rate of 61.2%. Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shanghai ” Industrial companies of the same size or greater in these regions have a return to work rate that has topped 50%, according to an official for China's economic planning body during a press conference on Wednesday. Shandong, Zhejiang ” Key businesses in foreign trade have a resumption of work rate of around 70%, the Commerce Ministry said Friday. Shanghai, Shandong, Hunan ” The rate of resumption of work has topped 80% for foreign-invested enterprises in these regions, the Commerce Ministry said Friday. Return of laborers ” The cumulative return rate of workers to 15 cities across China is about one-fourth of what it was during the corresponding post-holiday period last year, according to Nomura's analysis of data from Baidu. Power use ” Daily power coal consumption of the six major power generation groups rose 7% from a week ago, with a volume at 58% of what it was prior to the Lunar New Year holiday, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Friday. ” CNBC's Wendy Ye contributed to this report.",finance

In Hubei, there are 230 COVID-19 cases at the Wuhan Women's prison and 41 cases at the Shayang Hanjin prison, according to a report from the province's state-run newspaper on Friday. At about mid-day on Friday, Hubei province's health commission revised higher the number of confirmed cases to account for a written report from the prison department that disclosed well over 200 cases in its system. Of 271 prison cases, 51 were previously already included in regional figures. Up north, Shandong province's Rencheng prison reported 207 confirmed cases of the virus, according to state news agency Xinhua on Friday. Seven of those infected are prison officers while the rest are inmates, Xinhua said, adding that prison officers started reporting symptoms in early February. Xie Weijin, the provincial judicial department chief was removed from his post, Communist Party-owned People's Daily said in a tweet. Xinhua said his departure was a result of inadequate epidemic prevention and control. All are being treated and isolated, the state news agency added.  The Shilifeng prison in Zhejiang province also reported a total of 34 infections, including 27 new confirmed cases on Thursday. All of them are inmates, according to Chinese media. Two officials were removed from their post in this case, reported the Global Times, another government-owned news outlet.  Before the revised Hubei numbers were released, China's National Health Commission had said there were 889 new confirmed cases as of Feb. 20, bringing the total confirmed cases to 75,465. The death toll in mainland China so far is 2,236.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 227.57 points, or 0.78%, to 28992.41, while the S&P 500 dropped 35.48 points, or 1.05%, to 3337.75.

February's Markit PMI, or purchasing managers index, came in weaker than expected for both the manufacturing and services sectors. The manufacturing reading fell 1.1 points from the previous month to 50.8, below the 51.5 economists expected.

The decline came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia is considering a break from its four-year oil-production alliance with Russia . As the coronavirus outbreak leads to declining oil demand and falling prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and alliances have been considering further output cuts to stabilize the market. Russia, however, has been reluctant to follow suit, arguing it is still too early to judge the disease's impact and that weak demand could be offset by factors such as new sanctions on Venezuela. The WSJ reported that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are holding separate talks this week. If the group breaks with the Russians, OPEC's ability to influence oil prices could be further weakened. The group will meet in Vienna in early March to seek consensus on how much crude to deliver.

Greg Robb,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Fed's Brainard backs deploying untested monetary-policy plan in next recession,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-brainard-backs-aggressive-action-in-next-recession-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard on Friday said she favored a very aggressive policy approach to the next recession that would include capping interest rates beyond short-term rates, a policy k nown as yield-curve control. In a speech at a conference examining how the Fed should react in the next downturn, Brainard said the Fed should also pledge to keep interest rates at zero until the Fed achieves its targets of full employment and a 2% annual inflation rate. This could leave rates near 0% for a long time. The Fed has yet to hit its 2% inflation target a decade after the 2008 financial crisis. And many economist don't think full employment has been reached either. The lessons from the crisis would argue for an approach that commits to maintain policy at the lower bound until full employment and target inflation are achieved, Brainard said. In addition, Brainard said the Fed would control the yield curve until it achieved its goals. She suggested the Fed would focus on the short-end of the curve. This forward guidance could be reinforced by interest rate caps on short-term Treasury securities over the same horizon, the Fed governor said. The Fed didn't attempt yield-curve control during the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, officials used quantitative easing, or QE, which was the purchase of government securities to drive down interest rates. The last time yield curve control was used was during World War II, when the government needed low interest rates to fund the war effort. Under the yield-curve control policy, the Fed would target some longer-term yield and tell the market that it would buy bonds to keep the yield from rising above target. In theory, the central bank might not have to buy many bonds if the market believed the pledge was credible. A paper released by prominent economists at the conference Friday argued for just such an aggressive approach using these new tools. Read: All-star economists urge Fed to be aggressive to combat next recession Torsten SlΓΈk, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said the fact that yield-curve control was being considered was a sign of desperation that current tools are insufficient to combat another recession. For instance, there is concern that controlling the short-end of the yield curve would result in a kink that would push rates up for maturities the Fed had not capped. Two Fed officials said Friday they aren't worried about a recession in the near term, although the coronavirus is a risk to the outlook. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the economy was showing steady, strong, growth. The economy is strong. It can stand on its own feet and it can grow pretty consistently. And so we should let it do that, he said, in an interview on CNBC. He said the COVID-19 outbreak would likely result in a short-time hit for the economy. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard also said on CNBC that the coronavirus impact on economic growth would be temporary. Investors are more worried about the epidemic emanating from China that is impeding international trade and travel. Stocks DJIA, -0.64% were down firmly on Friday afternoon as worries about the coronavirus intensified.",business
Greg Robb,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Fed's Bullard says high probability coronavirus will be temporary shock,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-bullard-says-high-probability-coronavirus-will-be-temporary-shock-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"There is a ""high probability"" the COVID-19 outbreak will be a temporary shock, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said Friday. In an interview on CNBC, Bullard said that market expectations of more Fed rate cuts are tied to worries about a severe economic shock from the virus. If those fears ease, expectations for Fed rates will also change, and ""we will be back to an on-hold scenario,"" he said. Asked if he was worried about high valuations in equity markets, Bullard replied: ""We're ok for now."" Bullard has been arguing the U.S. economy will achieve a soft-landing. While stock valuations DJIA, +0.61% look high, there is less concern the low level of interest rates are factored in. Bullard has argued that the low-interest-rate environment is likely to persist. Minutes of the FOMC January meeting showed ""several"" Fed officials thought equity, corporate debt and commercial real estate valuations were ""elevated.""

"Hallie Gu, Dominique Patton",2/21/2020,reuters,China's chicken chain comes unstuck amid chaos of virus measures,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-chickens/chinas-chicken-chain-comes-unstuck-amid-chaos-of-virus-measures-idUSKBN20F0RA,"China's chicken farmers had been looking forward to a bumper year. But an unprecedented lockdown on people and goods to curb the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the short but intense poultry lifecycle, threatening output of meat just as the world's most populous country faces a massive pork shortfall. China's poultry production expanded by 12% last year to 22.39 million tonnes, after farmers sought to plug the gap from the pork shortage caused by African swine fever that ravaged the domestic hog herd. (GRAPHIC: China's chicken vs pork production - here) About half of China's chickens are raised by individual farmers involved in only one or two steps of the chicken chain, rather than integrated operations. But that has made them vulnerable to the restrictions on movement and labor shortage resulting from Beijing's efforts to curb the spread of a new coronavirus that has killed more than 2,200 people and infected around 75,000. Many roads to villages across the country are still blocked, despite government efforts to ease problems for vital industries like food, hampering feed deliveries and movement of birds. Some feed mills and slaughterhouses are still shut, while others are only starting to reopen after extended holidays and operating below capacity. That has upset the flow of a supply chain that starts with the sale of day-old chicks by hatcheries to breeding farms, continues with distribution of broiler chickens to growers, and ends in the slaughter of fattened birds, all in less than a year. Every step needs to work at the same pace, otherwise there will be an imbalance, said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at Rabobank. Pan Xingle, who raises chickens in Yi county in Hebei province for a slaughterhouse under contract, is still waiting to slaughter 16,000 birds that are already more than 50 days old. Broilers used for cheap meat by fast-food chains and public canteens reach their maximum weight of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) in around 40 days. But the slaughterhouse has only just reopened after an extended holiday and farmers are queuing to kill their chickens. I was told I'll need to wait for at least another 10 days, said Pan. That means Pan won't be restocking his farm with new chicks for a while longer, hurting business for some of the 45 million breeders that raise parent stock' around China. Prices for the day-old-chicks sold by those breeders are currently below cost, ranging from 1.4 yuan to 2.5 yuan (about 20 to 35 U.S. cents) per chick. The average price last year was 6.8 yuan. Zhang Yanguang, manager of breeding farm Beijing Lvyan Poultry Centre located in a village in the northwest of the capital, said even if he could sell his chicks, roads to the village are still blocked, and trucks can neither go in nor out. Worse, most of the slaughterhouses in the northeast and northwest of China are still shut so he can't get rid of unwanted birds either. The whole market is closed down, he said, estimating slaughter capacity is currently only running at around 30%. If pressure on farms like Zhang's continues past this month, it could force some out of business, said Pan, the analyst, hitting the hatcheries further upstream that raise grandparent stock to produce the breeders. Then the hatcheries will have to destroy day-old chicks or eggs, she said. With schools and many factories and restaurants still closed, lower production of chicken and eggs is not yet a problem. But once business returns, supplies could tighten, Pan said. The effect is likely to be seen in the second and third quarters, an agriculture ministry official said earlier this week. Similar challenges are facing egg farmers who are unable to get fresh eggs to market nor replace their old hens. We are selling our chicks really cheap, as little as 1.5 yuan instead of 4 yuan, so we're losing money, said Wang Lianzeng, chairman of Huayu Agricultural Science and Technology Co Ltd, one of the country's largest hatcheries for laying hens. That could help farmers like Li Shunji from northern Shandong province who is selling his eggs at a loss because he no longer has access to big markets in Beijing and Tianjin. But he still has worries. As he waited to take delivery of a new batch of baby chicks, he worried about transport disruption. They are so fragile at the moment. Moving them around might lead to their death, or reduce their productivity in the future. But I can't do anything. I will just have to wait. Reporting by Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton.

"Hanna Ziady, CNN Business",2/21/2020,cnn,Coronavirus: Investors are betting on a quick recovery. What if they're wrong? ,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/business/company-earnings-coronavirus/index.html," A growing number of companies are warning that the coronavirus will prevent them from meeting sales or profit targets for the first three months of the year. Some are even getting specific, and putting a number on the financial damage. Yet the situation remains highly uncertain, and many of the financial projections assume the coronavirus will be contained in China over the coming weeks and months, and that there won't be a major outbreak in another country. If the Chinese economy doesn't come roaring back as quickly as expected, investors could be caught off guard. ""Investors have largely taken the view that the impact will be temporary, hopefully short-lived, and that most of the weakness should be reversed with a strong rebound in the quarters that follow,"" Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote this week. Global air traffic could fall this year for the first time in a decade because of the coronavirus The International Air Transport Association, which represents major airlines, warned this week that coronavirus could cost global carriers nearly $30 billion in lost revenue . Global demand would drop by 4.7%, the first overall decline since the financial crisis. The group's financial estimate is based, however, on the disruption caused by SARS when it ripped through China in 2003. That virus caused real damage over a period of months, including for airlines, but the sharp decline in activity was ""followed by an equally quick recovery,"" according to IATA. Read More ""We don't yet know exactly how the [current] outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not,"" the group warned. Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, said Thursday that it was having a ""very weak"" start to the year, with factories in China, which make the goods it transports, running at around 50% to 60% of capacity. CEO SΓΈren Skou said he expects production to ramp up to 90% by the first week of March, but he cautioned that there are ""still a lot of uncertainties."" Shipping containers sit aboard a Maersk cargo ship in Hong Kong. Disney ( DIS ) warned that income from its parks in China could drop by $280 million this quarter, assuming the resorts are closed for two months. ""The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations,"" CFO Christine McCarthy said on an earnings call. How quickly China recovers matters a great deal to global companies. The country is the world's factory, churning out products such as the iPhone and driving demand for commodities like oil and copper. It also boasts hundreds of millions of wealthy consumers who spend big on luxury products, tourism and cars. China's economy accounted for roughly 4% of world GDP in 2003; it now makes up 16% of global output. Damage done The coronavirus has already caused significant damage. China's approach to containing the spread of the virus has kept cities under lockdown and factories shuttered, causing widespread disruption to businesses across the globe, which rely on China as a manufacturing powerhouse and a market for their goods. Qantas Airways ( QABSY ) said this week that the virus could shave up to $100 million off profit from the second half of its fiscal year. Air France-KLM ( AFLYY ) estimated the virus could slash its earnings by as much as $216 million between February and April. Jaguar Land Rover, which has resorted to flying parts out of China to keep production going in Europe, expects to take a hit from the collapse in demand for cars in the country, where passenger car sales plunged by 92% in the first two weeks of February, according to an industry association. Other companies with significant ties to China have also issued financial warnings, including Apple ( AAPL ) , Wynn Resorts ( WYNN ) and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) . What comes next? Much depends on whether the coronavirus continues to spread. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, told reporters Friday that there's great concern about the potential for the coronavirus to spread beyond China. There's still time to contain the virus, Ghebreyesus cautioned, ""but the window of opportunity is narrowing."" Coronavirus cases in South Korea, a major producer of the memory chips used in smartphones, have jumped from about 28 a week ago to more than 200. Singapore has reported 86 cases, while Iran said Friday that the virus has spread to several cities.",general
Hannah Miller,2/21/2020,cnbc,Facebook is the latest to pull out of a major industry conference as coronavirus fears batter travel industry,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/facebook-is-the-latest-to-pull-out-of-a-major-industry-conference-as-coronavirus-fears-batter-travel-industry.html,"The coronavirus outbreak has caused the cancellation or postponement of more than 24 exhibitions and conferences worldwide, hammering the $2.5 trillion trade show industry and foreshadowing more pain to come. Since the COVID-19 virus emerged in China in late December, U.S. airlines have cut service to much of China and Hong Kong, resulting in dozens of trade exhibitions and conferences being canceled or postponed. Corporations have pulled their executives from attending conferences across the globe, including major trade shows in the U.S., amid fears of a possible pandemic. The fast-spreading virus has infected more than 76,000 people ” up from 282 cases as of Jan. 20 ” and spread from four countries to more than two dozen in that time frame. Organizers of the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest trade show for the mobile phone industry, on Feb. 12 pulled the plug on the show less than two weeks before it was set to start in Barcelona, Spain. The cancellation marked a turning point for companies who fear the possibility of exposing their workers to the deadly new virus that's killed more than 2,100 in China over the last seven weeks. Last week, Facebook canceled its annual Global Marketing Summit scheduled for March 9 to 12 in San Francisco ""out of an abundance of caution"" over the virus. The event was expected to attract more than 4,000 participants. On Thursday, the social media company said it was also pulling out of next month's Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The Beijing Auto Show, originally scheduled for late April, was postponed earlier this week to prevent the disease's spread, according to the event's website. Shanghai Fashion Week, which was scheduled for March 26 to April 2 and features more than 1,200 fashion brands, was postponed last week on concerns about the coronavirus, according to the event's organizers. The Food&HotelAsia-Hotel Restaurant and Cafe expo, referred to as FHA-HoReCa, in Singapore has been moved from March to July. The event was postponed because of the outbreak, wrote Martyn Cox, the event's director, in an email to CNBC. The expo's sister event, FHA-Food & Beverage, was initially still scheduled for the end of March in Singapore. Its organizers planned to offer masks and hand sanitizer on-site to attendees. The expo was eventually postponed on Feb. 14. GSMA, the organizers of MWC ” which typically draws 100,000 visitors from all over the world ” announced the cancellation after exhibitors and speakers began canceling their travel plans en masse. The four-day conference was to feature keynote speakers from AT&T, Airbus, Google and other titans of industry. ""With due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country today, the GSMA has canceled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event,"" GSMA said in a statement. LG Electronics, Amazon, Ericsson, Cisco, Facebook, AT&T, Sony, Nvidia and other companies pulled out of the MWC prior to the cancellation. ""It was a difficult decision,"" said Frank Lee, director of public relations at LG MobileComm USA. ""LG wanted to minimize international travel."" The event is usually a major ""coming-out party"" for the year's new products on a global scale, according to Lee. Now, LG will focus on doing product announcements at the regional level. Amazon also canceled its attendance at MWC because of concerns about the virus, a spokesperson for the company's Amazon Web Services unit told CNBC. Ericsson had similar fears. ""Over the last couple of weeks, we have followed instructions and recommendations from authorities in different countries,"" said Mikaela Idermark, corporate communications manager at Ericsson, in a statement to CNBC. ""After an extensive internal risk assessment, we concluded that this is the most responsible decision."" The cancellation of trade events around the world is having damaging ripple effects across the hotel, airline, entertainment, marketing, restaurant and other industries. ""We will not know the economic impact until later this year, but it is substantial,"" said Cathy Breden, CEO of the Center for Exhibition Industry Research. The global business events industry generated $2.5 trillion worth of business sales in 2017, according to the latest research from the Events Industry Council and Oxford Economics. It also contributed $1.5 trillion to global GDP and employed 26 million people worldwide in 2017. China, in particular, is an important hub for trade events, and the exhibition industry is an ""economic engine"" for the country, according to Breden. With more than 76,000 cases of the virus and over 2,200 deaths, however, event organizers say postponing or canceling conferences is absolutely necessary. Some convention centers have even been converted into temporary hospitals. Marine Money Shanghai, a conference for shipping financiers, was planned for March 3 and 4, but was postponed because of the virus's growing severity and concerns from attendees. ""First in our minds was and will always be the health and safety not only of our community, friends and clients, but of everyone engaged in resolving the current challenge,"" Andrew Oates, business development manager for Marine Money Asia, wrote in an email to CNBC. Rescheduling events can pose serious financial issues for organizers, according to Breden. They may not be able to book the same venue for their preferred date and can lose money they've spent on the event space and other services like catering and conference management. Exhibitors and attendees also face challenges when events are canceled or when they choose not to attend, such as eating the costs of booth deposits, event registration and travel arrangements. Most importantly, they miss the opportunity of making potentially lucrative business connections, according to Sherrif Karamat, president and CEO of the Professional Convention Management Association. ""There's a tremendous amount of commerce that happens when we meet face to face that can't happen online,"" said Karamat. The coronavirus outbreak isn't scaring off all event planners, however. The Singapore Airshow took place last week, even after the U.S. Pentagon reduced its delegation and American defense firm Lockheed Martin completely pulled out. The aerospace and defense show instituted safety measures such as a ""no-contact policy"" for attendees. The event's official Twitter account posted a video showing its lion mascots demonstrating ""alternative greetings"" like bows and hand waves.  ""The Singapore Airshow organizers are doing a good job of working with experts, following all prescribed protocols and thoroughly communicating the best guidance to minimize the risk,"" said Chris Meyer, director of marketing and communications at Kallman Worldwide, which organizes the U.S. presence at the event. At the UFI CEO Summit in Rome earlier this month, business leaders in the events industry were concerned about the impact of the virus on future trade shows and conferences, according to attendee David Audrain, executive director of the Society of Independent Show Organizers. ""They're basically assuming all shows through March will be canceled [in China],"" Audrain said. Business leaders are also fearful of traveling to shows that have high Chinese participation and are considering not going to them even if they are in the U.S. or Europe, Audrain added. ""This will start to impact a significant number of shows that have Chinese exhibitors or Chinese attendees,"" he said. U.S. exhibitions are already seeing lower numbers of participants from China. At Sourcing@MAGIC, an apparel manufacturing trade show that took place in Las Vegas earlier this month, only half of the Chinese vendors were able to attend because of the U.S. travel ban on foreign nationals who had recently been in China, according to Tom Nastos, chief commercial officer of Informa Markets, the show's organizer. ""The other 50% were already in the country or other countries prior to the travel ban,"" Nastos said. American companies have also been hesitant to attend domestic trade events because of the outbreak. Sony PlayStation canceled its participation at PAX East 2020, a major video games convention scheduled Feb. 27 to March 1 in Boston, where there has been a confirmed case of the virus. ""We are disappointed to cancel our participation in this event, but the health and safety of our global workforce is our highest concern,"" PlayStation said in an announcement posted on its website. The company declined to comment further on the matter to CNBC. The convention's organizers were saddened by Sony's decision to pull out of PAX East 2020, according to the event's director, Kyle Marsden-Kish. He said PAX East 2020 will still go on, but with ""enhanced cleaning and sanitization across the show, including adhering to the recommendations set forth in the U.S. EPA's Emerging Pathogen Policy regarding cleaning disinfectants effective against the COVID-19 virus."" The U.S. events industry has been sharing information and using its experience with past crises to manage the outbreak, said Amy Calvert, CEO of the Events Industry Council. People feel more prepared today than they did with the SARS epidemic, she added. ""We want to try and remain calm,"" Calvert said. ""It's important to come from an informed place rather than one of fear."" ” CNBC's Noah Higgins-Dunn and William Feuer contributed to this article.

On a Los Angeles subway, a man proclaims Chinese people are filthy and says ""every disease has ever came from China."" Rampant ignorance and misinformation about the novel coronavirus , experts say, has led to racist and xenophobic attacks against fellow Americans or anyone in the US who looks East Asian. ""With news of the coronavirus, we've seen an uptick in fear of people who look like this,"" said Rosalind Chou, a sociology professor at Georgia State University. ""Real people are affected."" And the pain ranges from physical to verbal to financial. Read More ""We, the Asian community, are under attack,"" said Tanny Jiraprapasuke, who was born and raised in Los Angeles. Here's what's happening across the country, the facts about coronavirus, and what people can do if they witness attacks. A tirade on an LA subway goes viral Jiraprapasuke isn't even Chinese. But that didn't stop an irate passenger on the Los Angeles subway from singling her out and claiming Chinese people are putrid and responsible for all diseases. Jiraprapasuke, who is Thai American, said the man ranted for about 10 minutes and was specifically looking and gesturing at her. Unexpected impacts of the novel coronavirus She started recording the tirade as the man lectured another passenger. ""Every disease has ever came from China, homie. Everything comes from China because they're f****** disgusting,"" the man said. ""They can be so smart and be like, 'Oh yeah, I developed this, I developed that.' But like yeah, you can't even wipe your a**."" Jiraprapasuke went online and discovered many other people of Asian descent have been harassed or attacked because of misguided coronavirus fears. Many are using the global hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus -- French for ""I am not a virus."" ""It made me realize how big this is, and that what happened to me definitely is not unique,"" Jiraprapasuke said. ""What happened to me is not the worst that it can be."" A woman gets attacked out of the blue On the other side of the country, a woman at a New York subway station was assaulted by a stranger February 2. The woman was wearing a face mask -- something many East Asians have done long before the coronavirus outbreak, including for protection from pollution . One witness said she heard a man call the woman, who appeared Asian, a ""diseased b****."" The NYPD and the Hate Crime Task Force encourage the victim to report this incident to the police for a full investigation. https://t.co/4Qb4XHVj3Z ” NYPD Hate Crimes (@NYPDHateCrimes) February 5, 2020 ""To which she responded, 'Yeah, yeah, OK go away,'"" the witness wrote in a statement to CNN. ""I started getting my phone out after I saw this interaction, but in the process, the man hit the woman on the head."" The witness, who did not want to be identified to protect her privacy, said she started filming shortly after the man hit the woman on the head. The video then shows the woman chasing after the man, who turned around and attacked her. The New York Police Department is asking ""the victim to report this incident to the police for a full investigation."" The witness said although the attack was a ""terrifying"" situation, ""I believe that this incident has immense potential in opening up the discussion of Asian American-directed racial tension that has been caused by the"" novel coronavirus. ""The sad trend that I've observed about racially directed hate is that almost all of (it) stems from fearful ignorance,"" she wrote. ""Racial tensions are indeed escalating, and we now have significant reason to take agency in acting."" 2 Indiana hotels harass Hmong guests Kao Lor and his uncle Lee Lor were traveling through Indiana when they tried to get a room at a Super 8 Motel in the city of Plymouth. It didn't work. The two relatives, who are of Hmong descent, quickly faced extra scrutiny. Kao Lor said an employee asked whether he was Chinese. Lor began recording the encounter. ""If you're from China, I need to know,"" the employee said. JUST WATCHED Video shows a hotel employee refusing to allow an Asian guest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows a hotel employee refusing to allow an Asian guest 01:35 ""Because why?"" Lor asked. ""Because of the coronavirus going around,"" he replied. ""And anyone from China, I am told, has to be picked up and quarantined for two weeks."" That's not accurate. It's US citizens who have recently returned from China's Hubei province who must be quarantined for up to two weeks upon their return to the United States. When CNN asked the motel for comment, an employee provided a statement. ""The views and what the employee said is not the view and policy of Super 8 by Wyndham Plymouth,"" the statement said. ""Management is handling the employee involved. We are deeply saddened and embarrassed by the action of our employee."" Super 8 wasn't the only hotel that harassed the Lors. Kao Lor went to a nearby Days Inn and asked an employee on video if Asians are not allowed. The employee appears to say no , Asians aren't allowed. Wyndham Hotels, which franchises both the Days Inn and Super 8 brands, sent a statement to CNN. ""We're deeply troubled by these incidents as they're not reflective of our values or our expectations of franchisees,"" the statement read. ""While these locations are individually owned and operated, it's important to note that the 'corporate policy' referenced in the video does not exist."" Chinese restaurants are hurting tremendously A restaurant in New York's Chinatown has no customers, despite zero cases of novel coronavirus in the state of New York. Sometimes the most devastating hits are financial. At many Chinese restaurants, income has been decimated. ""On a normal day, we'd have around 100 tables a day,"" said David Zheng, an employee at New Shanghai Deluxe restaurant in New York's Chinatown. But now, ""for a full day of business, we'd get only 20 to 30 tables."" Owner Rose Wu says New Shanghai Deluxe has served the city for 19 years. Now it's suffering from a 70% to 80% loss of business. ""We had table reservations from customers a couple months in advance,"" but many have canceled, she said. ""A customer called and said, 'Mainland China has this disease. We are not going to come out anymore,'"" Wu said. ""No one in my restaurant has this disease. No one in Chinatown has this disease."" Indeed, no one in the entire state of New York has been diagnosed with novel coronavirus. Why are some fears misguided? While the novel coronavirus has infected more than 75,000 people and killed over 2,100 worldwide, it's caused far fewer deaths than the flu. Globally, an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die from the flu each year, the World Health Organization says. In the United States alone, an estimated 12,000 people have died from the illness so far this flu season , which started September 29, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Misguided coronavirus fears fuel racism and xenophobia in other countries, too By contrast, since the novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States in January, 15 people have been diagnosed with the illness as of Wednesday. None of them has died. Each of those 15 cases involved someone who has recently returned from Wuhan, China, or the spouse of someone who has recently returned from Wuhan. The US CDC notes that ""at this time, this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States ."" ""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,"" the US CDC said.

MUST WATCH Racism and xenophobia are on the rise as the coronavirus spreads 05:56 So what can people do if they see a racist tirade or attack? Deciding whether to act is a deeply personal choice. ""I'm not going to tell anyone it's not risky ... but I don't think staying silent is going to make anything better,"" said Lucy Duncan, who conducts training on bystander intervention for American Friends Service Committee . This is why everyday racial profiling is so dangerous If you do act, experts offer tips on how to stay safe and what not to do. First, bystanders can assess the risk by seeing how many people are nearby. It's good to make eye contact with others and gauge whether you'd have allies if intervening, Duncan said. Other tips include: -- Keeping a safe distance between yourself and the instigator -- Filming the event if it's OK with the victim -- Following up with the victim after the situation is over to see whether he or she needs anything else Of course, there are also risks to intervening. So it's important to consider your surroundings and how dangerous the instigator might be, said Andrew J. Scott, a retired police chief and president of AJS Consulting . For example: What you should (and shouldn't) do when defusing a racist tirade in public -- Is the perpetrator much larger than you are? -- If things get ugly, is there an easy escape route? Or are you stuck in a confined area? If you're too nervous to intervene, the American Friends Service Committee suggests moving closer to the person being harassed so you can communicate your support. Duncan said it's best to let perpetrators know that harassment and attacks won't be tolerated. ""The danger is if we don't speak up for each other, the number of people being targeted is going to be expanding."" she said. ""If they don't intervene, that kind of violence or that kind of incident becomes normalized."" CNN's Alice Yu, Shawn Nottingham and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",general

Tim's Take Tim Blanks talks to the British designer about his creative strategy and why his approach has struck a chord with consumers as the Kering-owned brand returns to growth. MILAN, Italy ”Β You have to watch the quiet ones. Isn't that what people say? It took soft-spoken, unassuming, early-thirty-something strawberry blond Daniel Lee 18 months at Bottega Veneta to annihilate the British Fashion Awards in December: Designer of the Year, British Designer of the Year, Accessories Designer of the Year, and Brand of the Year. You could blame that sweep on the fashion industry's predictable hunger for fresh flesh to reassert its relevance in a world which is increasingly bent on rendering it anything but. (Two years of coronavirus ravaging sales and it's game over!) Or, you could credit Lee with following the path which has led to success for countless creative people before him. Confront the orthodox. Capsize it. With a bag. There are surely countless hordes who'll be chewing on their eyeliner in a fury when they hear how it was all a happy accident. Sort of. When Lee arrived at Bottega in July 2018, there was a collection almost completed. That's why we didn't show that first season, he says. There was just enough time to execute a few bags so we could pull a few things together to do a campaign. He stripped the clothing back to iconic basics ” t-shirt, suit, trench ” and adapted a couple of bags from the archive. The Lauren bag, originally toted by Lauren Hutton in American Gigolo, was one. It was flatter than the Pouch, many more darts and hardware. It was made in a quite traditional way. We took the base pattern, screwed it up on top, made it in a much faster way. VoilΓ , the Pouch. Likewise, the cabat. His first week in the job, Lee took a spin round the Bottega outposts. Montebello, in the Veneto, is the brand's heart and soul. That's where the signature intrecciato leather weave was perfected by local artisans, where the factory that makes Bottega's homewares is located, where Lee saw a sample weave for a director's chair: one band of black leather attached to an exploded intrecciato. Eureka! Bag Number Two. And just like that, Bottega's brand reinvention is on track. In 2019, sales were nearly β‚¬1.2 billion, up 2.2 percent year-on-year, all credited to the new guy ” and his gummy, irresistible bags. (In the fourth quarter, sales were up 9.4 percent.) It seems so easy now, but Lee had to fight Bottega's merchandising department over the Pouch. There was no logo, no shoulder strap. It wasn't really that functional, because you had to root around in it. But it was true to the brand because when Bottega began, they made bags that were soft when everything else was really hard. And this bag had a tactile, soft, sensual, very photogenic aspect to it. There was so much dimension, so much depth because of the folds, the creases. And obviously objects that photograph well work today when the internet is such an important tool. If that sounds calculated, it really wasn't. Lee needed bags for a shoot. He did have faith that success is rooted in a brand's DNA, but he insists he had no idea how well that conviction paid off until the award ceremony in December. I was probably the last to know the bags had clicked. I feel like I was in hiding the whole of that first year. But when the numbers started to show that the Pouch was very quickly the bestselling Bottega bag ever, I was honestly shocked. It was something that was done so spontaneously to get through that first season. It was never something I thought would be so resonant. So, why the resonance? The psychology of the It Bag might one day be a subject of study for some post-human academy curious about our distractions as we careered towards apocalypse, but the phenomenon had fallen from favour till Lee resuscitated it. A bag is something you have every single day, he reasons. It contains your entire life. I'm fascinated by the idea that it holds all your secrets. He concedes there might even be something about the Pouch, so soft, like Fendi's famous Baguette, that encourages an emotional attachment. My bag, my pet. He himself carries a rucksack. He keeps his secrets for his coat pockets. He says he has many coats because he is always testing fabrics to see how they feel. Many pockets, many secrets. Or just lip balm and gum. Coming from Bradford in the North of England, kind of hard-scrabble, Lee's no child of privilege. But he leaves you with the inescapable feeling that he was blessed in some way. He was the weird one, the artistic one, in his family. He was always completely supported. Lee went to a very nurturing school. It left him with an unshakeable self-belief. Even 15 years ago, it already had a lot of LGBT students. He says he was a quiet student, in love with learning and making things. He sang in the choir and played piano, studied art and design technology, textiles, woodwork. He was smart so there was some expectation he might be a lawyer or doctor. But Lee loved dance, even fancied himself on stage. His nana, an ex-chorus girl, took him to the Alhambra in Bradford, where they saw Fame and Chicago. Then, when he was 16, he went to London for the first time (three hours by train, but a universe away) with his aunt, brother and sister. Big wide world seduced him in seconds. Lee's second trip to London was for his art foundation interview. After that, it was all about making up for lost time. Clubs, raves, living for the weekend. And Saint Martin's, crucible of perfervid creativity. He was hired immediately after graduation and spent the next decade in very gainful employment: Donna Karan, Balenciaga, Maison Margiela, Celine, where he was director of ready-to-wear design. Lee left Celine in March 2018 with a view to free-floating for a while. He was in Japan when his headhunter called. Something at Kering. No clues. There were some secret meetings, a request from Francois-Henri Pinault for a proposal of what he would do with Bottega. Up until that point, Lee had no idea he was being eyed for the top job. He claims that Bottega Veneta's craft was something that always resonated with him. Quite a dream actually, he says. I started with knitwear, so technique was always a huge source of inspiration. It's very similar to intrecciato, a way of construction that dictates the volume and form of an object. So his original proposal for Pinault was very close to how his Bottega turned out. But there were two huge facets to his revision: not just the creative, but also a corporate structure that was based on leather goods. Everything was focused on intrecciato, even the store network. Because most of the business was bags, the stores were small. Re-educating the entire company in the importance of ready to wear for the brand image has been huge. Now imagine that Bottega Veneta might have been in the doldrums, but it was hardly on its rims. Still a billion-dollar business. Surely it took massive balls for a pale, diffident redhead from Yorkshire to confront the corporate beast. Or stupidity, Lee says with a bone-dry laugh. Fortunately, he was told to be bold by his new boss. FranΓ§ois-Henri didn't want someone who was worried about what Bottega had been. We're talking about Kering here, the company that took a flier on a guy named Alessandro Michele with one of the dimming jewels in its corporate crown. Like Michele, Lee had nothing to lose. Like Gucci. Like Bottega. And Pinault is clearly comfortable with risk. Bottega Veneta AW19 Campaign It was incredible, but also terrifying, Lee says now. Sometimes you feel very big, others you feel minute. It's hard to explain. What he will acknowledge is the change in the creative director's role. Even Nicolas's job back in the Balenciaga days was very different from now. The industry has changed vastly in the last ten years. A creative director used to do two shows a year and a couple of ad campaigns. Now, every single day, there's content. Emails, Instagrams, billboards, takeovers, collaborations with wholesalers¦so many projects. But for all that stick, there is also a fabulous carrot. Lee is getting to meet, and even collaborate with, people from the disciplines he loved when he was growing up, specifically ballet and opera. The challenge is to build a different community, he says. He moved to Milan for Bottega. Now he gets to go to La Scala as often as possible. The last opera he saw was Romeo and Juliet, with the hot young conductor Lorenzo Viotti. Lee momentarily mists, which makes me think of Rick Owens heading to Saint Petersburg to see another hot conductor, Teodor Currentzis. Do I scent a post-Hot-Priest trend? While the bags cornered our fashion conversation, there was an entire new collection laid out on the floor of Lee's studio (the same space where Tomas Maier showed his Bottega collections during his remarkable 17-year tenure), ready for liftoff on Saturday. He is reluctant to say much about it. It's back to that idea of technique, bonded together in this particular collection. Everything is made in stretch. It's not so much destination dressing as clothes that travel with you, that you can use in any eventuality. The idea of movement and stretch, clothes that keep up with you, is why I also like knitwear. It's dynamic. It's a way to re-interpret those key staples of our wardrobe. I always love that moment when you have this piece of clothing or a bag or whatever and you think about yourself in different scenarios. At least I do. I buy a new gym kit and I can't wait to go to the gym because I want to wear it. I'm thinking maybe this t-shirt will make me work out better. The pragmatism in such a sentiment infuses Lee's Bottega. Is that modern? I have no idea, he answers. At the beginning of the year, I asked myself, What is the role of the artist in this world?' All I can think is to make beauty, give a sense of joy. A gift! I love that. What's so fantastic about design is that it's so in the moment, so consuming that what you're thinking about is what's at hand. It helps you through the darkest times, the saddest times. Whatever's going on outside, it's constant. Therapy? Yes, the best therapy is just to get on with it. Life right now is overwhelming for Lee. I feel vulnerable, he admits, but I don't think there's an alternative. Like a relationship, if you don't allow yourself to be vulnerable, you gain nothing. He says the new collection is very much about my experience of life at the moment, what I'm surrounded by. It's from my subconscious, but the whole thing has been that. That's why it's difficult to articulate. It's a feeling more than anything. Bottega is very emotional, and also sexual. Lee is an Aquarian, according to the cosmic dictum, someone who is prone to challenging rules. A friend of mine did a reading about the planets when I was born and there was huge creative potential, and also something about a very strong, particular sexual energy. Oh Daniel, you can't tell me that just as we're saying goodbye. We never talked about the sexual fire you've lit under Bottega, the intense physicality, the perverse marriage of fabric and flesh. It's almost something I'm discovering about myself, he says quietly. There's a mood board in his studio, not a sop for visitors, but a real working reference. Season on season, stuff gets added, stuff gets taken away. Someone who has been there from the very beginning is the fiercesome British musician PJ Harvey. I love this idea of a woman who is very much for herself and not for anyone else, Lee explains. Sometimes you see her completely stripped and bare, other times, she does a completely glamorous look. But it is always her who is empowered. That is my idea of Bottega. It is so much about you, not for the world. And PJ Harvey epitomises that. No wonder he's insistent that he's at the very beginning of this story. Much, much more to follow.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,2/21/2020,bbc,Coronavirus: Ukraine protesters attack buses carrying China evacuees,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51581805?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story,"Dozens of protesters in a Ukrainian town have attacked buses carrying evacuees from coronavirus-hit China. The evacuees were brought to a health spa in Novi Sanzhary, in the central Poltava region, where they will be held in quarantine for 14 days. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the protesters to show empathy. Ukraine's security service (SBU) said a fake email claiming to be from the health ministry falsely said some evacuees had contracted the virus. SBU officials are now investigating the apparent hoax, a statement said. Ukraine has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, which originated last year in China's Hubei province. To show solidarity with the evacuees, Ukraine's Health Minister Zoryana Skaletska on Friday joined them in quarantine and said she would run her ministry by Skype and phone. ""I hope that my presence there will calm those in Novi Sanzhary, as well as the rest of the country,"" she wrote in a Facebook post (in Ukrainian). On Thursday, 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals were flown from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the deadly outbreak, to Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. Six buses then drove them to the health spa in Novi Sanzhary, where they were met by demonstrators lighting bonfires and hurling stones. Armoured personnel carriers were seen deployed in the small town. After a tense stand-off, police and the national guard managed to unblock the road to the building where the evacuees would be spending 14 days. The country's health ministry said none of the passengers were sick. Ukraine's diplomatic mission added that three Ukrainians and a resident of Kazakhstan had been left behind in China, because they had reported having a fever. Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, Health Minister Zoryana Skaletska and Interior Minister Arsen Avakov all travelled to the town to try to calm tensions. In footage published by local media, Mr Avakov was seen telling the protesters: ""We are not talking about infected people, we are talking about healthy people."" One person then replied: ""So far."" In a statement, President Zelensky urged Ukrainians to show compassion and refrain from protesting. ""Most of the passengers are people under 30. They are almost like children to many of us,"" he said. ""But there is another danger that I would like to mention. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainians. Each of us - including those who ended up in Wuhan during the epidemic."" And on Friday, the president compared Thursday's clashes with the Europe in the Middle Ages. More than 76,000 cases of the disease named Covid-19 have been reported, and 2,247 related deaths. The vast majority of the cases and deaths have been in China.",general
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,2/21/2020,bbc,Coronavirus: Car sales in China fall 92% in February,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51583348/#comp-comments-button,"Car sales in China fell 92% in the first half of February as the coronavirus shutdown took its toll, according to an industry trade body. Car dealerships have remained closed while buyers have stayed away to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. Nationwide car sales slumped 96% in the first week of February to a daily average of just 811 vehicles. The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said it hoped sales would pick up as more showrooms reopened. ""There was barely anybody at car dealers in the first week of February as most people stayed at home,"" said CPCA secretary general Cui Dongshu. Dealers have gradually restarted operations this month, and the automobile trade body is hoping sales will improve during the second half of February. Chinese car maker Geely has just launched a  ""contactless"" service that lets customers buy its cars online and get them delivered directly to their homes. China is the world's biggest car market, selling just over 21 million cars last year, according to Statista. The US is the second biggest market. Even before the deadly outbreak, car sales in China were in decline due to a slowing economy and trade tensions with the US. While car sales have slumped, production has also been severely disrupted with many of the world's biggest car makers warning of delays. Many car companies had expected to restart operations in China this week. But even those firms that have re-opened some locations have warned it will take longer to return to full capacity than expected. It is not just car makers who are suffering disruptions in China, known as ""the world's factory"". Global manufacturers are also facing production delays, with Apple warning of global iPhone supply shortages. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has now risen to more than 2,200 people.",general

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joanna-partridge,2/21/2020,theguardian,Branson unveils first cruise ship as he shrugs off coronavirus fears,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/21/branson-unveils-first-cruise-ship-coronavirus-virgin-voyages,"Sir Richard Branson has launched his first cruise ship and brushed off concerns that the coronavirus outbreak will dissuade younger holidaymakers from embracing his latest venture. Despite the unfortunate timing “ with passengers on one ship quarantined in Japan after hundreds caught the virus, and another turned away by five countries over fears someone on board may be ill “ Branson said at the launch of Scarlet Lady that he saw cruises as a growth area. The ship is targeting young people with onboard entertainment that includes tattooing, yoga and DJs. The billionaire Virgin Group founder unveiled the liner in Dover . It will be the first of four ships to sail under the Virgin Voyages brand. I have dreamed of starting my own cruise line since I was in my 20s and I'm thrilled that moment has arrived, he said. The Voyages line joins the banking, airline and health club brands in Branson's Virgin Group at an turbulent time for the cruise industry. Approximately 3,700 passengers were sailing on the Diamond Princess when 10 were diagnosed with Covid-19 this month. During a two-week quarantine off the coast of Japan, 634 passengers and crew became infected with the virus, accounting for more than half of the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China. Seventy British nationals who were onboard the Diamond Princess will travel on a repatriation flight on Saturday morning. Branson highlighted strong growth in the cruising industry, with demand for cruising holidays increasing over the past decade. The industry expects about 32 million people to set sail in 2020, almost double the number in 2009. Cruises have traditionally been popular with older travellers, but Branson is pitching a boutique hotel-style, adults-only experience to appeal to younger customers. Virgin Voyages, like established cruise operators Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Cunard, is tapping into the trend for shorter trips, visiting a number of destinations but with only five nights onboard. The Virgin Voyages website promises more than 20 eateries offering world cuisine and no big dining halls, alongside specialist coffee bars, drag queens and spa treatments on each ship. The Scarlet Lady was built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy, and will accommodate up to 2,770 passengers and 1,160 crew on its maiden voyage around the Caribbean in April. The cruise industry has come in for criticism over its environmental impact, and the problems experienced by ports such as Venice amid constant arrivals of enormous ships. Virgin Voyages describes itself as the first cruise line to use Climeon technology, which collects heat generated from the ship's energy and converts it into electricity, which it says will reduce fuel demand. The company says it will also use carbon offsetting.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-liew,2/21/2020,theguardian,Dele Alli still looking for his role within JosΓ© Mourinho's Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/21/why-jose-mourinho-was-wrong-to-hang-deli-alli-out-to-dry,"Perhaps, on reflection, JosΓ© Mourinho wished it had been Dele's brother after all. As Dele Alli hurled his water bottle to the ground in fury at being substituted against RB Leipzig on Wednesday night, as first right boot and then left boot were flung off, Mourinho might have been tempted to conclude that his attempts at motivating his star playmaker had not met with unreserved success. It was Alli, after all, whom Mourinho had singled out during his first press conference in November as one of his most important projects. Are you Dele or Dele's brother? he asked during their first conversation. OK. Play like Dele. The real Dele. Now, in the aftermath of a first-leg Champions League defeat, the tone would be slightly different. I think he was angry with his performance, not with me, Mourinho said of Alli's outburst. I think he understands why I took him off. And our performance improved. Ouch. Factually, of course, there was very little to dispute. Alli had been poor all evening: a pale imitation of his very best, with no shots on goal and only 28 touches, the same as his goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, and the substitute Tanguy Ndombele, who replaced Alli in the 64th minute. Only five of those touches came in the final third. Only two came in the Leipzig penalty area. Even so, publicly flannelling one of your key players before a crucial game against your local rivals: let's optimistically file that one under Bold moves. And as Tottenham shape up for a Saturday lunchtime fixture at Chelsea that could be a decisive milestone in the race for Champions League qualification, one senses this was a gamble with quite a bit riding on it. Chelsea have historically been one of Alli's favourite teams to play against. He has six goals against them in eight appearances, the most of any opponent. Since Mourinho's arrival, moreover his output has risen sharply with more goals (six in all competitions), more expected goals (0.40 per 90 minutes) and more expected assists (0.22 per 90 minutes, both a significant increase on his last 12 months under Mauricio Pochettino). Under normal circumstances this would be a fixture to relish. But the Leipzig game, along with other recent games against high-quality opposition, offered something of a corrective. One could see Alli's exasperation growing as he was forced into chasing a succession of long balls into the channels, frozen out of the buildup, feeding off scraps. Mourinho has said he sees Alli primarily as a No 10 playing off the striker, rather than as a midfielder, but for a player who likes to feel involved in play nights like these can prove especially frustrating. Partly, of course, this is a function of circumstances: with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min injured, with Christian Eriksen gone, Alli is the only remaining member of the attacking quartet that for a couple of seasons was one of the most lethal front fours in Europe. Paradoxically the scarcity of options up front has simultaneously piled extra pressure on him to produce while also starving him of the supply chain that gives him the best chance of doing so. But to a large extent, this is also a product of deliberate choices. Mourinho's defence-first strategy in big games has condemned one of their most creative players to long periods at the periphery. His insistence that Alli play primarily in the final third has raised his goal output while arguably diminishing his overall influence. And his decision to criticise Alli publicly risks fracturing the confidence of a player who, for all the brash confidence of his public persona, is a good deal more introspective than many give him credit for. One could equally argue, of course, that Alli is the sort of player who requires the occasional rocket. That was certainly the view of Pochettino, who while lionising Alli in public often felt the need to point out his shortcomings in private. And the brainless coronavirus joke he posted to his Snapchat a couple of weeks ago was hardly the act of a player ready to take on greater responsibility. Alli will be 24 in a couple of months and should theoretically be entering his peak years. Instead he is still trying to sustain the jet-propelled promise of his early career, his place in England's Euro 2020 squad not secure. Perhaps it was this essential tension that found its explosive outlet on Wednesday night. Those who interpreted Alli's reaction to being substituted purely as an expression of brattish petulance are perhaps guilty of ignoring what came next. After sitting down he buried his head in his hands and then pulled his shirt over his face, blind wrath giving way to quiet devastation. It was in many ways a crushingly human moment, the point at which the dreams and unfettered ambition of youth seemed to collide head-on with the severe reality of playing up front in a team with 37% possession. Alli's mercurial talents have always been as much curse as gift. And there is perhaps a broader question: whether players are ultimately responsible for their performances and output or whether they are inextricably bound by circumstances: the team around them, the culture and ambience of the club, the tactics and strategy being pursued. Put more simply: does Mourinho have anything more to offer Alli than mind games? Or is he, to all purposes, on his own?",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauren-aratani,2/21/2020,theguardian,People are scared': New York City's Chinatown takes hit over coronavirus fears,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/21/nyc-chinatown-coronavirus-fears-business,"New York City's Chinatown is typically a bustling hub for locals and tourists alike, an economic center fueled by hundreds of independent shops selling everything from cellphones to steaming plates of shu mai. But recently, the streets of Chinatown's corner of downtown Manhattan have been quieter. Fewer tour groups are walking along the streets, fewer people are going to the neighborhood's most famous restaurants. Even some locals seem hesitant to go out to their favorite spots. Though Wuhan is nearly 7,500 miles (12,000km) from New York City, and there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the city or state of New York, Chinatown business owners say their restaurant and shops are taking hits over fears of the virus. We laid off about 40% of our staff to maintain the business because we're getting less profit, said David Ching, owner of Yin Ji Chang Fen, the sole New York outlet of a popular rice noodle roll chain in Guangzhou, China. Though the restaurant was packed to the brim with customers when it opened in September, the number of patrons dropped off by about 40% once news of the virus spread, Ching said. Before the typical lunch rush, Yin Ji Chang Fen had just a few tables open on Wednesday morning. But Ching said it was about half of what they would usually get before fears over the virus started. It's been slow, he said. Just down the street from Yin Ji Chang Fen, Julia Chang was the sole waitress taking orders at Julia Tea & Dim Sum House, the restaurant that bears her name. Business has been down by about 20%, forcing her and her co-owners to cut staff. Before we put a notice for hiring [on the window], and now I have to take it off, Chang said. People may be scared to come to Chinatown “ it's understandable. Though they declined to speak on the record since their managers were not in at the time, multiple employees at restaurants throughout New York's Chinatown said coronavirus fears has resulted in a noticeable decline in business. It's one word: terrible, one employee at a restaurant said. The decline in business in Chinatown coincides with an uptick in xenophobic attacks against people of Asian descent around the world. In Los Angeles, a woman said a man directed a rant about the coronavirus toward her. I'm not even Chinese ¦ He's really attacking me because I look a certain way. Though Chinatown is most known for its dining spots, other types of businesses have taken hits. Gina Ma, owner of a souvenir and gift shop said that, while the winter months are typically slower, only one or two customers are stopping in around lunchtime. On our customers' side, we definitely understand certain parts. We cannot blame [them], but it hurts right now. Ma noted that people who come in the store are often wearing masks, and she's scared that even a sneeze from a cold or allergy would turn people away. People think it's the Chinese ¦ We're living here in America, but people think that Chinatown has lots of Chinese, so they're scared. In response to the stigma the virus created around visiting Chinatown, local groups and elected officials in New York City have started a campaign called Show Some Love for Chinatown to attract support for local businesses. There is concern about the cumulative effect on this community. It's like a boxer, how many blows can you take before you go under? said Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corporation, which helped to coordinate the campaign. The ultimate answer lies with public support. It is so important. In other cities in the US, elected officials have made it a point to have lunch in their local Chinatown, reaffirming that fears of visiting the neighborhood are unfounded. Chinatown is safe. The city is safe. America is safe. Everybody should relax, said Kenney, Philadelphia's mayor, at a dim sum restaurant in the city's Chinatown district. There have been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US in seven states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of confirmed cases worldwide has exceeded 75,000, with the vast majority of cases concentrated in mainland China. Earlier this month, US officials said they evacuated 195 Americans from Wuhan, all of whom would be placed under a 14-day quarantine at an air reserve based in California. A temporary travel restriction was also put on foreign nationals who travelled to China. US citizens who recently traveled to China faced screening at and are required to undertake 14 days of self-screening. Chen has spent the last few weeks trying to assuage the public that fears over coronavirus are unfounded since the virus has not yet made it to New York City. Someone asked very sincerely: In the fish store next door, is the fish safe to eat?' That fish is not from China, that fish is from our local Atlantic Ocean, Chen said. It's generally that degree of unnecessary fear. Chen said that he remains hopeful that people will start to realize they have nothing to worry about when visiting New York City's Chinatown. We just believe that you should have no fear because it's thousands of miles away, Chen said. The biggest fear you should have is whether you have room for dessert.",general

Wuhan health authorities said Peng Yinhua, who worked in respiratory and critical care at Jiangxia district's First People's Hospital, had contracted the infection while working on the front line. Peng, who had been featured in state media previously for delaying his wedding to continue working, was admitted to hospital on 25 January. His condition dramatically worsened by 30 January, when he was sent to the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan for emergency treatment. He died on Thursday at 9.50pm, according to a statement from his hospital. His death came as China reported an increase in new cases of coronavirus, with 1,109 new confirmed infections, compared with 394 the day before, bringing the total number of cases in mainland China to 74,685. The death toll has now reached 2,236, with 118 new deaths as of the end of Thursday. It has also emerged more than 500 cases have been confirmed in prisons across China. On Friday, Hubei province revised its number of newly confirmed cases to add 220 infections from the province's prison system. Officials did not say when those infections took place but said that a total of 271 cases, of which 51 had already been counted, had been diagnosed. Of those, 230 were in Wuhan's women's prison. The head of the women's prison has been dismissed. In Rencheng prison in the eastern province of Shandong, 200 prisoners and seven guards tested positive as of Thursday, after infections among correctional officers were first detected last week. At Shilifeng prison in the southern province of Zhejiang, a total of 34 prisoners have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, including 27 new cases as of Thursday. According to state media, two prison officials have been fired over the incident in Shilifeng. In Shandong, seven prison officials as well as the party secretary for the province's department of justice have been removed. Officials said 2,077 people in Rencheng prison had now been tested. Authorities said they were setting up a specialist hospital and sending inspection teams to other prisons and detention centres. Meanwhile in Beijing, 36 people at Fuxing hospital have tested positive for the virus, prompting renewed anxiety about the virus as residents in the capital were slowly returning to work. The hospital had already been partly under lockdown after cases there were confirmed earlier this month. At another hospital, Peking University People's Hospital, three people were confirmed to have contracted the virus, according to state media. The three patients are family members. One had been hospitalised for kidney problems and may have contracted the illness when her daughter and son-in-law, who had recently travelled to Xinjiang, visited her in hospital. As infections outside China increase, the World Health Organization warned that countries were not treating the virus as public enemy number one. If we don't hit hard now using the window of opportunity, we might be faced with a serious problem, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday. This virus is very dangerous and it's public enemy number one and it's not being treated as such. This week, officials in Wuhan said frontline health workers who contracted the virus will be given 3,000 yuan ($430) in compensation. The families of those who die because of the virus will receive 5,000 yuan in condolence funds. Internet users criticised the amount, though some pointed out that families and infected workers would be eligible for other forms of compensation.One said: Is the country poor? You can treat tens of thousands of patients, provide protective equipment for medial staff every day .. build a new hospital in 10 days. Are you blind or is your brain made of excrement? Another said: When it is time to spend money, the government is stingy. When it is unnecessary, they spend a lot. This is not even enough for our leaders to drink Maotai, one commentator said, referring to an expensive brand of liquor favoured by Chinese elites. In South Korea, prime minister Chung Se-kyun said the country was entering an emergency phase following a surge in infections that has been linked to a controversial church. Mass gatherings have been banned, and all kindergartens and libraries closed in Daegu, a city that is home to 2.5 million people and lies two hours from Seoul. Soldiers in the city have also been forbidden from leaving their barracks after several military personnel tested positive. It looks like a zombie apocalypse A further 52 new cases were reported by officials on Friday, bringing the national total of confirmed patients to 156. Most are concentrated in Daegu, where a wave of infections have been linked to a 61-year-old woman, known as Patient 31. The patient is reported to have attended a church, an incident health officials have described as a super-spreading event. More than 400 members of the church, a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often accused of being a cult, are showing symptoms of the disease. Tests were still ongoing, according to the city's mayor, Kwon Young-jin. On Friday, the city's streets were mostly deserted, as people were urged to stay at home and wear masks, even indoors. Military medical staff are also being deployed to Daegu and neighbouring Cheongdo county, and isolation facilities are being created. It's like someone dropped a bomb in the middle of the city, resident Kim Geun-woo, 28, told Reuters by telephone. It looks like a zombie apocalypse. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said that while previous efforts had been focused on stopping the illness entering the country, officials were now concentrating on preventing the illness from spreading further in communities.

The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said barely anybody had looked to buy vehicles in the first half of February. Most dealerships have remained closed as a precaution. The plummeting domestic sales “ down 96% in the first week of February and 92% across the first half of the month “ come days after Jaguar Land Rover revealed it was currently making no sales in China. There was barely anybody at car dealers in the first week of February as most people stayed at home, said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the CPCA. Very few dealerships opened in the first weeks of February and they have had very little customer traffic. Only 4,909 cars were sold in the first 16 days of the month, down from 59,930 in the same period last year, in a market where more than 25m cars were sold in 2019. On Friday the Japanese carmakers Nissan and Honda further delayed restarting their manufacturing plants near the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China until at least 11 March after the latest government directive to contain the spread. The shutdown in China has disrupted the global supply chain as carmakers struggle to source the tens of thousands of parts needed for each car. This week, Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company had been forced to fly parts in suitcases from China to the UK as supplies continued to dwindle.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned that falling passenger demand as a result of the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus would cost the airline industry $29.3bn (Β£23.7bn) in lost revenues this year. In its initial assessment of the impact, the organisation said it expected global demand for air travel to fall by 4.7% in 2020, the first overall decline since the global financial crisis in 2008-09. Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes. Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue, said Alexandre de Juniac, director general and chief executive of Iata. This will be a very tough year for airlines. The vast majority of the financial impact will hit airlines in the Asia Pacific region, where revenues will fall by $27.8bn, with the bulk borne by carriers registered in China. Iata estimates that losses in China's domestic market will hit $12.8bn. Carriers outside Asia Pacific are forecast to lose about $1.5bn this year, assuming the loss of demand is limited to markets linked to China. Iata said: The sharp downturn in demand as a result of Covid-19 will have a financial impact on airlines “ severe for those particularly exposed to the China market. These estimates are based on a scenario where Covid-19 has a similar V-shaped impact on demand as was experienced during Sars. That was characterised by a six-month period with a sharp decline followed by an equally quick recovery. De Juniac warned that Iata's assessment was based on the coronavirus public health emergency not spreading beyond China. If it spreads more widely to Asia Pacific markets then impacts on airlines from other regions would be larger, he said. Iata said it was premature to estimate what the revenue loss would mean for the global profitability of the airline industry. Airlines including Qantas and Air France-KLM have cancelled flights to and from China and have warned of weaker demand for travel in Asia.

Roger Stone, a self-described political dirty trickster and longtime ally of the president, was sentenced on Thursday to more than three years in prison after attempting to sabotage the congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by lying to investigators about his contacts with WikiLeaks and trying to block the testimony of a witness to protect Donald Trump. After his sentencing, a representative for Stone urged Trump to right this horrible wrong and pardon him “ before the president suggested he might do so. Totally tainted'. The president undermined proceedings, tweeting they were fraudulent and claiming the jury forewoman was an anti-Trump activist during a running commentary of the case. Above the law?

An army of automated Twitter bots are distorting online conversations to make climate science denialism more prevalent, with research finding a quarter of all climate-related tweets are produced by bots. Analysis of millions of tweets from around the time Trump announced he would withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in June 2017 suggested bots had a substantial impact in amplifying misinformation, while disproportionately tending to applaud and support the president. Fake science'. Bots were responsible for 38% of tweets that claimed scientific falsehoods with the phrase used by Trump to dismiss the climate crisis, and 28% of all tweets about the petroleum giant Exxon.

Members of Congress were told Russia was trying to interfere in the 2020 election campaign in favour of Donald Trump last week, according to reports that said it led to the abrupt removal of the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire. The alleged briefing led the president to announce the appointment of the hardline loyalist Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany, after a confrontation with Maguire, a former navy admiral, in the Oval Office. Motive. Grenell's appointment is an attempt to politicize intelligence and hide information from Congress as Russia again assists Trump, claimed the former justice department spokesman Matthew Miller on Twitter.

Your travel rights regarding coronavirus explained,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/21/going-to-east-asia-your-travel-rights-regarding-coronavirus-explained,"As the coronavirus outbreak nears its third month and shows few signs of abating before the spring holiday season, insurers and airlines face a growing number of claims as passengers attempt to cancel. But in what circumstances will they pay up, or offer refunds? I have a trip to China booked in March. Will I get my money back? Yes. The fact that the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to the whole of mainland China (and all travel to Hubei) makes things easier. Tour operators have cancelled immediate trips “ as have most airlines “ and have all been offering full refunds. British Airways has cancelled all its flights to Beijing and Shanghai until 31 March. If you had booked an independent trip, your flight should be refundable. Other big losses should be reclaimable from your travel insurer, assuming you bought cover before this blew up. Axa, one of the biggest underwriters of travel policies in the UK said: We always follow Foreign Office advice. So if you're scheduled to travel to a region or a country the FCO has asked people to avoid, our policies will kick in, says a spokeswoman. Generally, insurers will only pay out provided you bought the cover before the virus hit the headlines and became a known factor. What about Hong Kong? The fact that Foreign Office is not advising against travel to Hong Kong makes things more complicated. The good news is that plenty of airlines are offering passengers with flight bookings to the city the chance to cancel or to move the flight date to later in the year. British Airways has been offering those with Hong Kong flights up until 1 April the chance to rebook on to another flight, or request a refund. Cathay Pacific this week said it had been forced to cancel 40% of flights for February and March. However, insurers are under no obligation to pay claims for significant expenses if you could get there, but chose not to travel. I'm due to tour China in May. What should I do? The advice is to wait and see. The Foreign Office is constantly reviewing its advice, and in the face of the continued outbreak the no-travel ban advice would likely remain, meaning operators would have to cancel trips and refund. Insurers would have to follow suit. However, once the effective travel ban was lifted, insurers would no longer have to pay up if you decided not to travel “ unless your GP advised against it. I am supposed to be taking my elderly parents to an affected area soon, but we don't want to risk it. Will our insurance cover it? Technically not, unless the Foreign Office changes its advice and advises against travel to your chosen destination. Aside from Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Indonesia will be regarded by many as higher risk areas. Thailand saw a lot of Chinese visitors over the Lunar new year celebrations, but British tourists who decide they no longer with to travel are not entitled to refunds. The big exception is if your GP has advised you or any of your party not to travel to a virus area, in which case your travel insurance should then kick in. Axa told Money: If your GP tells you not to travel to a nearby area (not China), you should contact us before your departure date, and you won't be penalised. However, it noted that the normal conditions of declaring pre-existing conditions will apply. So, if you were told not to travel by your doctor because of an underlying lung problem that you had not declared to your insurer when you bought the policy, you may find your claim turned down, or the payout reduced. That said, and given that the virus disproportionately affects the elderly, most doctors would probably recommend not travelling to a virus-affected area, with or without any previous medical conditions. In such cases it may be hard for an insurer to turn down a claim, although you can bet that some will try. It would be a similar story if the government lifts its travel-ban advice but the airline continues not offering flights. And it would be hard for an insurer to turn down a claim for other losses, if you could not get to your destination. If I ignore any government advice against all but essential travel, will my travel insurance still cover me? The Association of British Insurers is clear. If you travel against government advice then you will most likely find that this invalidates your travel insurance. If unsure, speak to your travel insurer, it says. I am due to travel to Asia in June, but am yet to buy the flights. Can I limit my exposure to the virus? There has never been a cheaper time to book flights to east Asia but it is risky, given the possibility of events moving out of control. The advice is to buy tickets from an airline that offers flexible fares, or the chance to rebook at a later time. British Airways, for example, will let buyers change their flight booking for Β£150 per person plus any additional fare costs. Nearly all basic economy flights will not be refunded on cancellations, but you can choose to pay more for a semi flexible or flexible ticket, although the costs mount up. For example, Turkish Airlines was this week quoting a non-refundable economy fare of Β£240 to fly one way from London to Hong Kong (via Istanbul) on 7 March. The semi-flexible fare, which allows a fee-free date change, costs Β£404. The fully refundable fare costs Β£595. A canny buyer could opt for the latter, cancelling it in the event of a significant development of the virus. If the virus is successfully tackled, you could cancel the expensive flight, take the refund, and rebook a cheaper flight if available. Most of the big chains in Hong Kong are offering fully cancellable rooms this week, in an attempt to get some bookings. No sane person is making non-refundable hotel bookings in Asia right now. Has there ever been a cheaper time to visit Asia? At least nine out of 10 hotel rooms in Hong Kong are currently unoccupied, according to a South China Morning Post report this week, which said the hotel industry is in a life or death struggle to survive. Last February there were up to 200,000 tourist arrivals every day in Hong Kong, but this has slowed to just 3,000. Many hotels have chosen to shut down temporarily instead. The impact is being felt in Da Nang in Vietnam, Bali in Indonesia and Siem Reap (Angkor Wat) in Cambodia. Four star hotels in Siem Reap are currently offering rooms starting at Β£8 a night, while five star hotels are as low as Β£20 a night. But the super-luxe hotels in Hong Kong are clinging on to their rates; the Mandarin is charging Β£400 a night. Or book a cruise? For the cruise industry, the coronavirus has been a public-relations nightmare. The world has watched as the Diamond Princess liner has been quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, its 3,600 passengers and crew stuck and the number of people infected by the coronavirus climbing to over 600. This week two passengers died. If you are made of strong stuff, you will practically be able to name your price on taking a cruise this summer. This week the Norwegian Cruise Line was advertising its biggest sale of the decade with at least 30% off. Expect prices to fall even further.",general

Millions of lives have been altered by the outbreak, from those in self-isolation in China to Chinese nationals experiencing racism abroad. We talk to those affected in different ways, from Wuhan to the north of England. Wi, a 29-year-old Chinese PhD student in the Midlands, is originally from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak and where her parents have been in self-quarantine for more than 20 days. They can't walk, they can't leave their own flat “ it's not a holiday, it's like jail, she said. They are unable to even open windows for fear that the virus will spread through the air. Now the whole of Wuhan is closed, all public transport and private cars have been stopped, so they can't even drive their own cars on the road. So they just stay at home, eating, sleeping and watching movies. That's all they can do, Wi said. Wi's parents have not been told when they will be allowed to leave their flat. Wi has become concerned about the mental health of those in isolation in the city, after seeing posts on social media with locals saying they would rather kill themselves than remain in quarantine any longer. The biggest enemy is not the virus, it's mental health. When you stay in one room for half a month, that's horrible, you cannot go outside or get fresh air. A hundred miles from Wuhan, nestled in the countryside of Hubei province, British teacher Claude* is in self-isolation with his Chinese girlfriend and her family in her hometown, which the pair were visiting for the lunar new year. After a day or two it became a ghost town, Claude, 46, said. The first week I was just relaxing “ I work near Hong Kong so this was my holiday. I thought I would have more cabin fever by now, but I'm actually pretty fine. My girlfriends's family are cooking lots and cleaning for us, so I'm being spoilt. He described the town as post-apocalyptic, with speakers playing American swing music on empty streets, and men in biohazard suits checking people's temperatures before they enter Walmart. He and his girlfriend still do not know when they will be allowed to leave. But when they finally return to their home in Shenzhen, they will be required to undergo another two weeks in quarantine. Claude said the mood in the town was pretty chilled out, but feared this could change in coming weeks as supplies run low. As the days go on, more people are wearing masks, and people are standing further and further apart, he said. In neighbouring Hunan province, Yuhan, a 28-year-old Chinese national who lives and works in Melbourne, is also trapped, after returning to visit her family for the new year. She has been in self-quarantine with her parents for 29 days, leaving only to visit her grandmother who lives 200 metres away. Yuhan worries that the isolation could last another two weeks. The family order groceries online once every two or three days, and spend most of their time cooking and watching TV. They usually go to her grandmother's for lunch and leave food for her dinner. But Yuhan said many of her friends' families would not leave the house at all. My grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it's sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her, she said. It is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news. In the country's most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs. Rob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire. The worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too, he said. The school has said they can't do anything “ they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it's illegal not to cancel their visas if they're not working. Rob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged Β£6 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenants' allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them. Some people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles. Airline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people blatantly tested far above the threshold but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old. My partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn't seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren't properly over their face. At Heathrow, there were no checks or information. It was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day, he said. I was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren't even any posters. Us and a litany of sick coughing people from an Air China flight waltzed right out the airport. There was hand sanitiser everywhere but no one seemed to use it, he added. I felt it was all a bit half-arsed. Back in the UK, the Chinese community are feeling the effects of the virus. Lee*, a Chinese PhD student in the north of England, was subjected to racist abuse on a night out because of the coronavirus. He said he and two Chinese friends were on their way to a shopping centre one evening when three men in a car began shouting at them. They called us Chinese virus' and you Chinese bastards', Lee said. We were really afraid. We passed them quickly and we kept silent because we were scared they might do something violent. There was nobody else out on the street and we wanted to stay safe. It felt very dangerous at the time. Lee said that since the incident he has stayed at home more, only going out for university meetings or shopping for food. He feels that since the outbreak cultural differences are causing issues. The British do not tend to wear face masks but it is normal for Asian people, he said. Now my Chinese friends get stared at for wearing them. *Some names have been changed.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicola-davis,2/21/2020,theguardian,Who is most at risk of contracting coronavirus?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/who-is-most-at-risk-of-contracting-coronavirus,"There have been a number of deaths from the coronavirus among doctors who are young and, as far as we know, otherwise healthy. According to Dr Bharat Pankhania, an expert on communicable disease control at the University of Exeter Medical School, it is not surprising that some young, healthy people die after contracting the virus, noting the risk of infection and even death is not zero for any demographic. All of us are at risk, and hence the superlative efforts at keeping containment in place, and keeping the virus from circulating as much as we can do, he said. David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed. This is a new disease in humans, so no-one has immunity“ health workers, like everyone else, don't have immunity, he said. It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as: Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Yes. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. China's national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. Heymann said that who succumbs to the infection and who shrugs it off is often down to individual differences in the body's response to the virus. Some groups have a greater risk than others. At the moment it appears that people who are at greater risk are the elderly and probably the very young, said Pankhania. But, he added, you cannot have that only the elderly and the very young will die, it is part of the natural history of such infections that we will get deaths across the age ranges ¦ The same pathophysiology can happen in the young as in the old. In short, yes. It is not surprising that fellow clinical colleagues have got infected and some have died, said Pankhania, noting that medical professionals were in a special situation as they had multiple potential exposures to infection. You have got infection control in place, however if you are forever being targeted, on the one rare occasion where your guard slipped, you get infected, he said. It is like being in the battlefield “ no matter how much protection you have, a stray bullet can catch you sometimes. Such a slip, he added, was not surprising. A minor slip is eminently possible, especially when you are working under stress, you are tired, you have done long hours and your guard falls “ and you get infected, he said. Pankhania said that at present it was thought there was only one form of the virus in circulation, so doctors were not being exposed to a more serious strain. But Heymann said that if doctors did become exposed to the virus, it might be in a higher dose than would have occurred in a social context “ for example, they might come into contact with bodily fluids. If there is a massive inoculum of virus, that could make it a more overwhelming infection, he said. That is a tricky question. Heymann said there was evidence that some patients in China infected with coronavirus also had flu at the same time. If that were the case, this could possibly increase the severity of a coronavirus infection, just because the body is already fighting [flu], and it might overwhelm the system, he said, but added that remained a theory. However Heymann noted prior exposure to all sorts of bugs meant that health workers in general tended to have quite robust immune systems. In a clinical setting you need full personal protective equipment, so you would be fully gowned, said Pankhania, adding that airtight masks were also used. You can only breathe through the filter on that mask. Goggles were used, he added, noting it was possible to be infected through the eyes, while gloves were also important. A colleague has to watch you put [the equipment] on and a colleague has to watch you take it off, and you would systematically put it on and systematically take it off, said Pankhania. Otherwise you risk contaminating yourself in the process of taking it off. But he added that under stress, mistakes could happen. Pankhania said the 1918 flu pandemic offered one possibility, noting that some young people showed an exuberant immune response “ in other words, their immune system reacted too strongly to infection. In some cases, as yet poorly explained, poorly understood, the immune response is over the top “ that immune response then turns itself upon the person's body itself, he said, adding that could lead to fluid loss and organ damage. Buthe said it was not yet clear if this was at play in the current coronavirus outbreak. The question remains open, but this week the World Health Organization director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters that a number of trials were under way looking at the potential use of two HIV drugs as well as another antiviral called remdesivir that was developed to tackle haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola. Results, it seems, may be expected in three to four months. Meanwhile Columbia University researchers have received a $2m (Β£1.5m) grant to work on possible antivirals drugs and antibodies to tackle coronavirus. There are a lot of unknowns, including whether the virus could mutate to a more virulent form, while Pankhania said experts were still looking at the rate of deaths among those infected. One key number is known as the R0, or basic reproduction number, which indicates how many new cases an infected person generates. At present it is thought to be about 2.6. However, Pankhania said there was reason to be cautiously optimistic, noting that the figure might be lower outside of China, not least since other countries have had prior warning of the virus, while Wuhan is a densely populated city. He urged people in the UK to stay calm and said there was no reason to give up social events, quit the gym or keep children from playdates. That is absolutely overreacting, he said. At this point in time there is no coronavirus circulating in the UK in a free way. No, it is important to try to contain the coronavirus. A new virus has emerged out of the blue, said Pankhania, adding that it was believed to have started in bats, entered another animal and then passed to humans. It can not only infect humans, but be transmitted among humans and cause disease, he said. The upshot is the potential for a new virus circulating around the globe causing illness and death. It is an extra burden on humanity, an extra infection in addition to influenza, and there is also an unknownness about it, which is we don't know how many people it could make very ill, we don't know how many people it will take, hence our concerns, he said.",general

Asked on Friday if the new cases put the crisis at a tipping point, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the window of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This outbreak could go in any direction, Tedros said. If we do well, we can avert any serious crisis, but if we squander the opportunity then we will have a serious problem on our hands. The increase in Middle East cases came as Italy reported its first death “ a 78-year-old man in Padova in the Veneto region. Earlier the country had identified 16 new cases, with authorities in the north ordering the closure of schools, bars and other public spaces in 10 towns. More than 50,000 people have been asked to stay at home, while all public activities such as church masses and sporting events have been banned for up to a week. Iranian health authorities reported two fatalities on Friday, according to Mehr news agency, adding to the two elderly patients who died on Wednesday. A further 14 people tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Iran began in the city of Qom, an often-visited religious destination. The health ministry official Minou Mohrez warned it had since spread to several cities, including the capital, Tehran, according to the official IRNA news agency. It's possible that it exists in all cities in Iran, she said, adding the source of the virus was likely a Chinese worker in Qom. As the country held a parliamentary election on Friday, state television showed voters in Qom wearing surgical masks. Earlier this week, authorities closed all schools in the city as a precaution and called for the suspension of religious gatherings. The threat posed is especially concerning in Iran after several years of tightening US sanctions by the Trump administration that have dangerously undermined the domestic health care system. In addition, the sharp devaluation of the Iranian rial makes it extremely unlikely its government would be able to throw the resources at an epidemic as witnessed in China. To prevent infections, neighbouring Iraq shut its land crossings with Iran. However, the virus already appears to have leaked out of the country and across international borders. In Lebanon, the health minister, Hamad Hassan, reported the country's first case of the virus on Friday, stating the patient was a 45-year-old woman who arrived on Thursday on a flight from Qom. At a news conference in Beirut, he said the ministry was also following up on the cases of two other suspected cases. The new coronavirus, which causes the illness recently named by the WHO as Covid-19, has infected more than 76,000 people in 27 countries and led to more than 2,200 deaths since December. There have been only a few cases in the Middle East so far. Nine have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, seven of whom are Chinese nationals, and one in Egypt. In Israel, the health ministry announced the country's first case, saying the patient was an Israeli woman who had been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The ship was carrying more than 3,700 people in early February, when 10 passengers were diagnosed with Covid-19. Since it was docked and quarantined in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, with two people dying. Eleven Israelis who initially tested negative were flown home by chartered plane overnight on Thursday. However, on arrival, a woman failed a breath sample check, the ministry said, and was immediately moved to a special isolation unit at a hospital near Tel Aviv. The repatriation of people from the Diamond Princess, as well as parts of China and other countries affected by the coronavirus, has caused fears of outbreaks on their return. In Ukraine, protesters on Thursday attacked buses carrying 45 Ukrainians and 27 other evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus' centre, to the small town of Novi Sanzhary, fearing they would be a health hazard. Videos showed dozens of protesters lighting tires ablaze and hurling rocks at the buses carrying the evacuees. Riot police broke up the crowds and detained 24 people. The Ukrainian government has planned to quarantine the people at a sanatorium there for two weeks. In an attempt to calm the demonstrators, the health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, pledged to spend the next two weeks in the same sanatorium. A selfie she posted from her room in quarantine was followed by the hashtags calling on Ukrainians not to fear our own and I am not afraid of the virus, I am with you. In Italy, as well as the death of the 78-year-old man, 15 other coronavirus cases have been confirmed. Several towns in the northern Lombardy region, where 14 of the cases were detected, are under lockdown after officials warned residents to stay home and avoid social contact. The fatality and the other case are in the Veneto region. The first locally transmitted case in Italy was that of a 38-year-old Italian man, who contracted the disease after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China. He is in intensive care. His pregnant wife is also infected, as is a person who played sport with the man. Italian media reported that three other cases were in elderly people who frequented a bar in the Lombardy town of Codogno, near Lodi, that is owned by the father of the man who played sport with the 38-year-old. Giulio Gallera, Lombardy's welfare councillor, said the other eight cases included five health workers and three patients at Codogno hospital. There have already been clusters of the virus in Germany and France, said Roberto Speranza, the health minister. Italy is ready. We had already prepared a plan because it was evident that what has happened could happen. Now it's a question of applying the plan. Clearly this plan features immediate decisions for the areas of the outbreak in order to limit it. Ά This article was amended on 24 February 2020.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour,2/21/2020,theguardian,Iran's leaders warn low turnout in election will boost Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/irans-leaders-warn-low-turnout-in-election-will-boost-trump,"Iran's senior leaders flooded the media with eve-of-poll warnings that abstentions in Friday's parliamentary elections “ either through indifference or as a protest “ will only encourage Donald Trump to step up economic sanctions against Tehran. The one-week period of officially sanctioned campaigning for a seat in the next five year parliament ended on Wednesday night, 24 hours before voting started amid the first serious outbreak of coronavirus in Iran. Fifty-eight million Iranians are entitled to vote in what the Iranian government claims is the benchmark for democracy in west Asia, but which many in the west dismiss as an elaborate charade. On Thursday the US announced sanctions against five members of the guardian council, saying the body that vets all parliamentary candidates was guilty of electoral manipulation. The elections are seen as a real chance for conservatives “ known as principalists “ to cement their grip on power by seizing control of one of the last of Iran's political institutions outside their control. Reformist politicians are divided: some favour abstention on the twin grounds that the elections have been rigged, through the mass disqualification of reformist candidates, and that the parliament is toothless, as legislation from the current Reformist-led parliament has been blocked by the council. The last parliament tried to do something about political prisoners, and to go to visit the jails, and was just told to go away, said one reformist. But other reformists insist the stakes are too high to abandon the ground to hardliners. Mostafa Kavakebian, a prominent Tehran reformist, wrapped up his campaign at Shahid Mo'atamedi, a sports complex in Khazaneh, a run-down working class neighbourhood in south Tehran, by claiming the future of the country as a semi-pluralist republic was at risk. As he climbed into his car after a rally in front of 300 supporters, he was still complaining that too many reformists had been disqualified from standing by the guardian council. Surrounded by reporters and jostling supporters, he said the reformists ran out of time to challenge the disqualifications and said the whole process “ including the criteria by which candidates could be disqualified “ needed overhaul. The outgoing parliament's legislation to reduce the guardian council's scope for interference had been blocked by the guardian council itself, he said. In a speech, he warned: If parliament becomes a political monopoly, the institutions parallel to parliament will be doubled in strength. The parliament will be neutralised and the republican aspect of the Islamic Republic system would be a show. He urged the Iranian government to stop dodging the blame for all the country's problems: We will not let people's livelihoods get any worse. Our youth are unemployed and want jobs and housing. We should not hide these problems and simply put the responsibility of America, Israel and the Saudis. I know they are not powerful enough to do these things . He defended his long-term advocacy of engagement with the west, saying: Our goal is to solve the issue of sanctions in order to solve the economic problems of the people. We have no desire to negotiate with the terrorist America that martyred [the commander of Iran's Quds Force] Qassem Suleimani, but we believe we should have a interaction with the world. Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year. He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father's debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic. Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come. By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq's streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership. Once described by American commander David Petraeus as a truly evil figure', Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence. Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. You will start the war but we will end it. Michael Safi Many of those advocating abstention are close to despair and admit they have been over-optimistic about the change that can be achieved under the uncompromising supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Yet some figures in government are nervous, fearing that the guardian council may have shot itself in the foot and depressed the turnout in urban areas by going so much further than normal in debarring so many prominent reformists. As a result, patriotic calls to vote to defeat the west came from every layer of Iranian government “ military, political and clerical. Hesameddin Ashena, a senior adviser to the president, Hassan Rouhani, said that however angry people might feel, abstention will only please Iran's enemies and lead to increased sanctions, an increased probability of military invasion, larger budgets for hired anti-Iranian media, a decline in national resilience and reduced political bargaining power. Khamenei himself warned that friends and foe are watching out for the election results. He said the enemies wanted to see what had been the result of Trump's policy of maximum economic pressure. He said it was not just an Iranian's national and revolutionary duty to vote, but a religious one. Even Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, also said a big turnout would strengthen Iran diplomatically, although he said he would have preferred to have seen a wider choice of candidates. A turnout well below 50% would probably unnerve the regime and reveal disenchantment with an apparently ineffective parliament. In the 10 parliamentary elections since the 1979 revolution, turnout peaked at 71% in 2006. The lowest turnout was 51% in 2004, and the average is just over 62%. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, the spokesman for the guardian council, predicted a turnout of more than 50%, although some say the turnout in reformist-minded cities such as the capital could be a derisory 30% In the course of an hour-long press conference at a plush north Tehran hotel, Kadkhodaei was directly challenged about fixing the election. Question after question from foreign and domestic reporters focused on why he had disqualified so many reformists. None of the questions had been vetted in advance. Impassive throughout and virtually hidden from view by a phalanx of microphones, he insisted the council is not a political club, and simply follows the letter of the law as it had in previous elections. He said it was up to the candidates to make public any reason they had been rejected. Asked whether a one-horse race tends to produce less interest in the outcome of the race, he said this was not a relevant comparison, arguing there were many political parties from which voters could choose. But rejected reformist candidates say their letters of rejection were explicitly political, citing issues such as their loyalty to the supreme leader, the nuclear deal or their attitude towards the hijab. They are so arrogant they do not really hide what they are doing, one activist said.",general
https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe,2/21/2020,theguardian,Thai court dissolves opposition party Future Forward,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/thai-court-dissolves-opposition-party-future-forward,"One of Thailand's most popular opposition parties has been disbanded after it was found to have violated electoral rules by receiving an illegal loan, a decision analysts say is likely to heighten political tensions. The constitutional court dissolved Future Forward on Friday and banned 16 of its leaders from politics for 10 years. Future Forward, which has criticised the Thai army's influence over politics, was founded less than two years ago but has rapidly emerged as a prominent opposition voice, gaining more than 6m votes during an election last year. Future Forward's anti-establishment message, and its charismatic leader, the billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, appealed especially to younger voters. But the party has been dogged by legal charges, which it says are politically motivated. On Friday, the court ruled the party had violated election rules by taking a 191.2m baht (Β£4.7m) loan from Thanathorn. The law limits donations from an individual to 10m baht. Thanathorn denies any wrongdoing, and some political commentators say other parties' finances have not been scrutinised in the same way. The decision will strengthen the parliamentary strength of a coalition led by Prayuth Chan-ocha. The prime minister, who initially took power in a military coup in 2014, was reinstated as leader during a process critics said was rigged in favour of the army. Thanathorn, who was suspended from parliament in November over separate allegations, said in a comment on Facebook: Why do we face a party dissolution, a ban on executives and even jail for wanting to build a new type of honest political party with good intentions and transparency? Future Forward has been hit with a series of legal charges, some of which carry a possible prison sentence, including sedition and an allegation the party broke public assembly law by organising a flash mob. Last month, the party was cleared of separate claims that it was seeking to overthrow the monarchy and had links to the Illuminati “ a suggestion apparently based on the party's symbol, an upside-down triangle. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the decision to disband the party was a critical setback for democratic development. [Future Forward] was a party that stood against military-authoritarian rule and more importantly against the circular nature of Thai politics that has made the country stuck at a standstill for 15 years, he said, adding that other parties had not been held to the same standards. On Friday, an image that read I am one of 6,330,617 people. Don't kill our voice, was shared widely on Twitter, referring to the number of people who voted for Future Forward last year, when it came third in the election. This will definitely heighten the political uneasiness in the country, said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian MP and chair of the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian nations. It's going to create a sense of illegitimacy on the part of government and young people feeling they are being locked out of the system. Most of the party's lawmakers will retain their seats and can form a new party, but the ban on its leaders will reduce the opposition's votes and influence in parliament. The effective disenfranchisement of so many voters could prompt street protests, say analysts. The decision comes at a time of growing concern over Thailand's stagnating economy, the threat of coronavirus “ which has dealt a major blow to the tourism sector as well as posing a challenge to public health “ the country's dangerous pollution levels, and drought. Thai people like [Future Forward] supporters will either have to rise up in their own way or they will have to put up with autocratic preferences that have resulted in early economic stagnation, said Thitinan. An initial request by Thailand's election panel for the constitutional court to ban the party prompted thousands of people to take to the streets of Bangkok. A month later, thousands also gathered before dawn at a park in the capital to participate in what was described as an anti-government run “ a show of defiance against Prayuth's government. The established centres of power will likely become more repressive and autocratic, said Thitinan. What we don't know is the level of determination and resolve of reformers who want a better Thailand.",general

The New Zealand man found guilty of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane in November 2018 has been sentenced to life in prison, with no parole for at least 17 years. Millane, 22, from Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she died by strangulation in the Auckland hotel room of a man she met on the dating app Tinder. The man took photographs, then packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in bushland. Her remains were found eight days later. Manual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence ¦ cold-blooded, said Justice Simon Moore in Auckland's high court on Friday morning. Your actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim ¦ You didn't ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room. Grace's parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom. The tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye, said Gillian. Grace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, my very best friend. The crown prosecutor, Brian Dickey, said the man's crime against Millane had been personalised, depraved and callous. By court order the man's name cannot be published and the reason for this is also suppressed. Worker rules will fuel modern slavery' “ Closing UK borders to low-skilled workers risks driving vulnerable EU citizens into modern slavery, charities have warned. The East European Resource Centre predicts some businesses might be happy to hire undocumented workers if the supply of low-skilled workers is choked off by the Tories' immigration policy. Let's not kid ourselves: someone will have to do the dirty, low-paid jobs, from construction to food processing to social care. Where are these workers going to come from? said Barbara Drozdowicz, the centre's chief executive. Critics of the government's proposed immigration laws say they do not make sense in an economy where there is near full employment. Emily Kenway, from Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: If you take away the legal routes, people are just going to fall into the hands of traffickers. If we think of the tragedy in October when 39 Vietnamese people were killed, you see the terrible consequences of that. DΓ΅il number incomplete “ Leo Varadkar has resigned as Ireland's taoiseach as the wrangling to form a government continues following the election. Varadkar will remain as caretaker in the post, equivalent to prime minister, until his Fine Gael party, Fianna FΓ΅il, Sinn FΓ©in or a combination of those and others can assemble a working majority. Last night, at a testy sitting of the DΓ΅il Γ‰ireann, Varadkar, the Sinn FΓ©in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna FΓ΅il leader, MicheΓ΅l Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were all nominated for taoiseach but fell far short of receiving the votes required. Several left wing parties supported McDonald for taoiseach, underlining their preference for a left wing rainbow coalition. But, writes Rory Carroll, there is widespread acceptance that a stable government will require two of the three big parties “ and Fine Gael appears determined to go into opposition, saying it needs to regroup after nine years in office and a hammering from voters. Regions miss share of jobs “ Almost half of new jobs in England in the past decade were in London and the south-east, which hold only a third of the population, the thinktank IPPR North has found. The north-east and north-west of England and Yorkshire and the Humber had 17% of the country's new jobs despite containing 28% of the population. Boris Johnson, has promised to put levelling up regional divides at the top of his government's agenda but Luke Raikes from IPPR North said: This parliament must be the devolution parliament. It is time to overturn the centralisation that's let towns, cities and regions fall into decline ¦ Levelling up should mean opening the door for all of England to benefit from devolution, while also letting areas that have devolution take on more. In today's long read, Luke Brown tells the story of how his Lancashire hometown of Fleetwood “ the once-proud fishing port, home of Fleetwood Town FC and its Cod Army, as well as Fisherman's Friend lozenges “ is hanging on, and the people who won't give up on it. And there is hope in Redcar, North Yorkshire, where a land deal means steelmaking could be back up and running within three years. Tap forgotten shares for charity' “ A government scheme that gives proceeds of dormant bank accounts to good causes could raise a further Β£2bn by expanding to unclaimed insurance payouts and share sales. Since 2011 the UK's 30 biggest banks and building societies have been voluntarily transferring money left in dormant bank accounts to the scheme, called Big Society Capital, with Β£600m redistributed to charities helping young people get into work and housing, and others tackling financial exclusion. Under the existing scheme, if at a later date a consumer discovers they had a dormant account, they are always able reclaim the money.

https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoewood,2/21/2020,theguardian,Hammerson offloads nine UK retail parks for Β£455m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/21/hammerson-offloads-seven-uk-retail-parks,"Hammerson has offloaded its out-of-town retail parks for Β£455m as it looks to reduce its Β£3bn debt pile and shield itself from the high-street crisis. The property group, which owns the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, is selling seven sites, including Elliott's Field in Rugby and the Cyfarthfa park in Merthyr Tydfil, to the London-based private equity firm Orion for Β£400m. The sale of two other parks has raised another Β£55m. However, in a sign of the tough market conditions faced by retail property groups, the parks are being sold at a knock-down price. The Β£455m raised is 22% less than the properties were valued at last summer. Last year David Atkins, the Hammerson chief executive, promised to sell more assets after coming under pressure from an activist investor, the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, to improve performance. The company's share price has declined 40% in the past 12 months to 225p. Atkins said: Against a challenged retail and investment backdrop we have exited the retail parks sector. Having achieved disposals of close to Β£1bn since the beginning of 2019, our focus remains on strengthening our balance sheet to create further resilience. The sale of its stake in a French shopping centre raised Β£363m, with other retail park sales boosting the figure to Β£1bn. Hammerson is trying to claw back credibility after a turbulent recent history that included the abandonment of a plan to buy smaller rival Intu Properties, the company behind the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester. It also fended off a Β£4.9bn takeover approach from the French mall operator KlΓ©pierre. The disposals come at a tough time for property groups, which have been hit hard by the high-street crisis. Hammerson also owns a stake in Bicester Village, the Oxfordshire designer discount outlet, which is reported to be struggling as the coronavirus outbreak keeps high-spending Chinese shoppers away. Retail failures and restructuring programmes have pulled down rents while even household names such as Marks & Spencer want to operate fewer stores as sales move online. Confidence was further undermined by the suspension of the Β£2.5bn M&G Property Portfolio fund “ which remains closed “ after it could not sell properties fast enough to repay investors who wanted out. Intu is trying to persuade investors to back an emergency cash call despite a bombed-out share price of just 14p, which values the company at less than Β£200m. Hammerson has now disposed of 14 retail parks and plans to sell its remaining interest in the Brent South site, which is part of Brent Cross. The company will update investors on Tuesday, when it is due to publish its annual results. The Stifel analyst John Cahill said that despite the reduced price tag, the sale of the retail parks was unequivocally good news for Hammerson. The sale of all the remaining retail parks in one go reduces contagion into the rest of the portfolio valuation and makes a substantial contribution to reducing leverage, plus exposure to the UK, he said.",general
Jack Morse,2/21/2020,mashable,"Verizon drops out of RSA cybersecurity event over coronavirus fears, following AT&T and IBM",https://mashable.com/article/verizon-drops-out-rsa-cybersecurity-conference-coronavirus/,"It would seem that the corporate sponsors of the RSA security conference are no match for IRL viruses. Conference organizers announced Friday that Verizon has joined the growing ranks of companies bailing on the annual San Francisco cybersecurity event, which is slated to begin on Feb. 24. Following IBM and AT&T, Verizon is the latest company to pull out at the last minute, and, according to the RSA, the blame lies on the coronavirus ” officially dubbed COVID-19. ""We learned today that Verizon has decided to no longer participate in RSA Conference 2020 as a Gold Sponsor,"" reads the statement. ""We understand and respect their decision."" In case the motivation for Verizon's decision was unclear, the statement is titled ""Novel Coronavirus Update."" We reached out to both Verizon and RSA in an attempt to determine what exactly that means. Is the company simply no longer dropping down a ton of cash to sponsor the conference? Or, rather, are both Verizon employees and executives ” at least one of whom, Verizon chief product officer Alexander Schlager, is still listed as giving a talk on Feb. 26 ” sitting this year's conference out? Unfortunately, we received no immediate response. However, if IBM's example is any indication, we don't expect to see many Verizon folks at the conference. ""The health of IBMers continues to be our primary concern as we monitor upcoming events and travel relative to Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19),"" an IBM spokesperson told Mashable over email last week. ""As a result, we are cancelling our participation in this year's RSA conference taking place February 24 - 28 in San Francisco."" AT&T Cybersecurity, meanwhile, pulled out ""as a Gold Sponsor"" back on Feb. 20. Organizers for the RSA event, which drew over 42,000 attendees in 2019, are going out of their way to reassure those who are still planning on attending (including this reporter) that it's taking coronavirus concerns seriously. ""In addition to following CDC recommendations like frequent hand washing, RSA Conference reminds attendees that other preventive measures have been put in place to help reduce the risk of infection,"" reads an RSA press release. ""The Moscone Center is following recommendations in the US EPA's Emerging Pathogen Policy regarding the use of cleaning disinfectants effective against the coronavirus and CDC health screenings for qualified travelers arriving from international destinations at the San Francisco International Airport."" SEE ALSO: Cybersecurity conference exposed attendee info via a garbage app San Francisco Mayor London Breed even got in on the action, issuing a statement on Feb. 20 urging conference participants to ""set an example to prevent fear, rumors, and misinformation from guiding our actions."" As of today, RSA organizers say that 14 exhibitors have canceled their involvement. Verizon's last minute decision to join those ranks suggests we may see even more companies decide to follow suit.

Jane Li,2/21/2020,qz,"Chinese coronavirus expert: Some ""recovered"" patients may still be infectious ” Quartz",https://www.qz.com/1806050/chinese-coronavirus-expert-recovered-patients-may-still-be-infectious/,"A key Chinese respiratory disease expert said that some discharged coronavirus patients could still carry the virus and be infectious, potentially posing another complication to Beijing's efforts to control the epidemic. Zhao Jianping, the head of the coronavirus containment team in worst-affected Hubei province, said a minority of patients who were discharged from hospital after tests showed they were negative for the virus later tested positive again. China counts patients whose throat or nose swabs show up positive for the virus in a nucleic acid test, and those whose CT scans show lesions in their lungs, as infected cases. The criteria for deciding if a patient has recovered varies between provinces, but in general Chinese hospitals require people to test negative twice in a row, and to show no obvious symptoms such as a fever. Patients who are released are supposed to check in with their hospital and can face retesting”which is when some tested positive again. That means during the period when a patient deemed recovered leaves the hospital and goes back home, they could infect the people they are in touch with, Zhao told Beijing News (link in Chinese, Feb. 18). As this kind of situation exists, we encourage recovered patients to also be put on quarantine for 14 days, he said. One possible reason for the later positive results could be due to the varying quality of testing kits, he said, meaning the patients were not actually fully recovered at the time of release. In an interview (link in Chinese) with Southern People Weekly yesterday (Feb. 20), Zhao said he considered this a highly dangerous situation: Where could you put such patients? They could infect others being at home, but they would also occupy the stretched resources at hospitals if they are there. China reported 889 new cases and 118 further deaths through Thursday (Feb. 20), bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 75,465, while 2,236 have died from the illness, according to the national health commission. Around a quarter of the newly confirmed cases came from two prisons in Shandong and Zhejiang province, which reported 227 cases yesterday. The head official for Shandong's department of justice wasΒ sacked (link in Chinese) over the infections, according to the Beijing News. Millions of people remain on lockdown in China, restricted from leaving their homes, and many companies continued to work from home this week to prevent contagion, steps that appear to have yielded results. But as China tries to moderate the hit to its economy, and workers start returning to offices and factories in greater numbers in coming days, there's a risk of an increase in new cases. The most difficult period of the spread of the coronavirus has passed in Hubei¦ But we need to stay vigilant, because the number of confirmed cases could bounce back again if we relax the current measures too much, said Zhao, who also warns that rather than outbreak being brought to a conclusive end, as with the coronavirus SARS in 2003, people may have to learn to co-exist with the new coronavirus, as they do with the flu.",tech
Jason Aten,2/21/2020,inc,Twitter May Let Users Mark Fake News as 'Harmfully Misleading.' Here's Why It Won't Work,https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/twitter-may-let-users-mark-fake-news-as-harmfully-misleading-heres-why-it-wont-work.html,"As election season ramps up, social media networks are under increased scrutiny over the prevalence of misleading, and often outright fake information posted on their platforms. Twitter appears to be testing a plan that would involve using journalists and fact-checkers to mark posts by public figures that are deemed ""harmfully misleading."" That's from a report from NBC, which received a leaked demo of the new plan. Those efforts include a possible points-based system that would reward users whoΒ ""provide critical context to help people understand [the]Β information they see.""Β The points system is designed to help reduce the possibility that bad actors would try to manipulate the reporting process. The plan also includes marking false tweets with a large orange box labeled ""harmfully misleading."" Users would also be able to report tweets, and add context or clarify bad information. By highlighting reportsΒ from verified--and presumably neutral sources--it seems the company is counting on that information to help people make better decisions. Twitter confirmed to NBC that the leaked information represents a ""possible iteration of a new policy"" that the company plans to roll out March 5th. A spokesperson for Twitter said the company isΒ ""exploring a number of ways to address misinformation and provide more context for tweets on Twitter."" And it's not just candidates and their surrogates battling it out and spreading what can only be charitably called political spin. The recent Coronavirus outbreak has led to an onslaught of bad information. In that regard, Twitter and Facebook don't have the luxury of not doing anything. Fake news isΒ a real problem, and it requires a real solution. The problem is that the solutionΒ should be different based on the type of bad information. For example, identifying misleading information about a global health emergency is relatively objective. It's also really important sinceΒ bad information can lead people to make bad decisions. (No you should never drink bleach.) While I'm willingΒ to give the company credit forΒ recognizing its fake news problem. Every company should be willing to look at its own flaws and attempt to fix them. However, I'm not optimistic that this is going to help--especially for elections. First of all, let's pretend that it's possible for unbiased, neutral observers to objectively evaluate information and identify the bad stuff. I'm not convinced that's possibleΒ since many journalists are seen as having a viewpoint, but for the sake of argument, we'll pretend it is. The problem, then, is this: In a highly polarizedΒ environment (like elections)Β people don't even agree on what's true. It's not just that people share false information, it's thatΒ their followers and supporters believe that it's true. Marking it as ""harmfully misleading"" isn't likely to be a persuasive argumentΒ when people often can't even agree on an objective standard of reality. And for those people, there are no neutral sources of verified information. If you mark something my person says as false--you're not neutral and you're notΒ being helpful--you're attacking what I believe.

Central bank officials have indicated that they are content to keep policy on hold as they watch economic developments play out. However, traders in the fed funds futures market are indicating about a 54% chance of a rate cut by June and a 58% probability of a second move lower by the end of the year, according to the CME's FedWatch tracking tool. In an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Bullard pushed back on the likelihood of a cut, saying current policy seems right considering the pace of the record-breaking U.S. expansion. ""There's a high probability that the coronavirus will blow over as other viruses have, be a temporary shock and everything will come back. But there's a low probability that this could get much worse,"" he said. ""Markets have to price that in, and that drags down the center of gravity a little bit. But if this all goes away, I expect that pricing will come back out of the market and we'll be back to the on-hold scenario."" Bullard spoke the day after Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida jolted markets when he told CNBC that he pays less attention to market pricing and more to economist forecasts, which don't see the Fed cutting. The statement helped exacerbate a sell-off that came amid heightened fear that the coronavirus spread could be even worse than thought. Aside from the virus worries, Fed officials have been generally optimistic about the outlook, saying the strong U.S. labor market and signs of a pickup in global growth are indications that rates are probably appropriate. The Fed cut rates three times in 2019 but has held the line at the last two meetings. ""If you think that this virus is going to dissipate and we're going to have temporary shocks and then everything's going to go back to normal, then I think the Fed's in great shape and we don't have to lower rates in that scenario,"" Bullard said. ""A lot of the news on the U.S. economy has been good in the last couple of months. I've been arguing we're in good shape for a soft landing in the U.S. economy.""",finance

Despite the market pricing in up to two cuts this year, Bostic said that unless there's a significant shift in economic performance, the Fed should stay put. ""There are many different scenarios about what's going to happen between now and say June or July. My baseline expectations are that the economy is not going to see rising risks and it's going to stay stable, so we won't have to do anything,"" he told CNBC's Steve Liesman during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""But my focus is on today and what we know today and what we know next week as the data comes in. If we see more weakness than expected, then I'd be open to moving. But that's not my expectation,"" he added. Though he is not a voter this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, Bostic gets input into the decision-making process. Earlier Friday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard also told CNBC he does not see a likelihood of a cut, and both speakers come a day after Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida also told the network that he's not anticipating a change. Markets, though, are not on the same page. Traders in the fund funds futures market are indicating a 54% chance of a rate cut by June and a 59% probability of two moves by the end of the year, despite consistent statements from Fed officials indicating otherwise. Markets fear that the coronavirus could continue to spread and dent global economic growth, necessitating a further easing on policy beyond the three cuts the Fed implemented in 2019. Like Bullard, Bostic said he expects the coronavirus to be ""a short-term hit"" to the economy. ""I have no impulses really to think that we need to do anything differently with our policy stance than we are doing today,"" Bostic said. The Fed currently targets its benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a range between 1.5%-1.75%. The FOMC has kept the rate steady the past two meetings after last year's cuts.",finance
Jeffry Bartash,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Existing-home sales dip in January as tight supplies limit opportunities for buyers,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/existing-home-sales-dip-in-january-as-tight-supplies-limit-opportunities-for-buyers-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"The numbers: Sales of previously-owned homes fell slightly in January, but they still appear to be trending higher overall amid a mini-boom in the real estate business tied to tumbling mortgage rates. Existing-home sales slipped 1.3% last month to an annual pace of 5.46 million the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That's how many homes would be sold if the rate of sales was the same for the entire year. Read: This barometer says the U.S. economy got off to a good start in 2020 Yet in a sign of how much stronger demand has gotten, sales of previously owned homes were almost 10% higher compared to the same month last year. The only reason sales probably aren't even stronger is a lack of homes for sale. What happened: Sales fell more than 9% in the West, accounting for all of the decline last month. Sales rose slightly in the South and Midwest and were flat in the Northeast. The median sales price for existing homes in January registered $266,300, up 6.8% from a year earlier. Although lower mortgage rates have made it somewhat easier to buy, the lack of supply is still pushing prices higher. The inventory of homes for sale rose a bit to 1.42 million in January, but the supply sits just above the lowest level on record. There was a 3.1 month supply of homes for sale last month, up a tick from a record low in December. The general rule of thumb is that a 6-month supply is a sign of a balanced market. Read: U.S. jobless claims cling near postrecession low Big picture: The U.S. housing industry has rebounded from a lull at the end of 2018 owing to a sharp decline in mortgage rates. A stable economy, low unemployment and rising number of families with children are also helping to juice up demand. Builders are boosting construction to take advantage of the uptrend, but prices will continue to rise unless the supply of homes increases faster or more owners put their properties up sale, neither of which seems likely. If so, the level overall level of sales will continue to be constrained. What they're saying: Tight inventories are still the story for existing home sales. Despite pent-up demand and mortgage rates that are near record lows, existing home sales continue to be constrained by a limited supply of homes for sale, economists Gregory Daco and Nancy Vanden Houten wrote to clients in a note.

The forecasting firm IHS Markit said its indexes for manufacturers and service-oriented firms both declined this month, according to a flash or preliminary reading. And the services index turned negative for the first time since 2015. One bright spot: Most executives who were polled said they think the current weakness is temporary and that business will bounce back later in the year. There's widespread optimism that the current slowdown will prove shortlived, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit Read: This barometer says the U.S. economy got off to a good start in 2020 What happened: In a big surprise, the index covering the large service side of the economy sank 4 points to 49.4, IHS Markit said Friday. The coronavirus scare is already hurting companies in the tourism and travel industries that generate lots of business from Chinese customers. The flash manufacturing gauge, meanwhile, slipped to 50.8 points from 51.9 in January. Any number over 50 signifies expansion; below 50 points to contraction. See: Industrial output slumps in January for fourth decline in past five months Big picture: The U.S. appeared to get off to a good start in 2020, but the damage caused by the spread of the COVID-19 illness in China has disrupted global supply chains and other parts of the world economy. Apple AAPL, +0.24% , for instance, warned sales might fall short of forecast because it might not be able to produce and ship iPhones on schedule. More and more companies are also saying their businesses have been hurt.

The upcoming presidential election is another potential pitfall. Leading Democrats vow to raise business taxes and increase regulations if they get elected What they are saying?: While we certainly wouldn't rule out economic growth slowing further in the first quarter, weighed down by the crisis at Boeing and disruption due to the coronavirus, we have a hard time believing the apparent message from the Markit PMI that the economy is on the brink of a recession, said eoonomist Michael Pearce of Capital Economics.

Jess Sheldon,2/21/2020,express,Pound to euro exchange rate and Post Office rates today ahead of PMI figures,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1245388/pound-to-euro-exchange-rate-today-post-office-latest-news-2020," The pound to euro exchange rate has struggled to cling onto gains this week, trading well below the β‚¬1.20 level on Thursday. It came after GBP rocketed to a new post-election high earlier this week, on Monday. The pound is currently trading at 1.1943, according to Bloomberg at the time of writing. The exchange rate opened at 1.1947 today, Bloomberg says. Michael Brown, currency expert at Caxton FX, spoke to Express.co.uk about the latest pound to euro exchange rate figures. He said: Sterling struggled on Thursday, trading well below the β‚¬1.20 level, despite a surge in retail sales that confirmed the post-election bounce in the economy and snapped a record-long 5 month streak of no growth. READ MORE: Pound to euro exchange rate: Sterling slumps - can you still get good holiday money rate?  Today, the latest flash PMI figures will be parsed for any impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the UK economy, while investors expect the surveys to consolidate last month's jump. The Coronavirus outbreak in China was first reported last month. To date, nine patients in England have now tested positive for coronavirus. As of February 20, a total of 5,549 people have been tested, of which 5,540 were confirmed negative and nine positive, the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England said. UK Chief Medical Officers have raised the risk of the public from low to moderate, based on the World Health Organization's declaration that this is a public health emergency of international concern. Ryan Howsam, chairman of Staysure said: ""At Staysure, we are always on hand to help our customers in these situations. Customers who booked their holiday before the outbreak was a known event and purchased the Travel Disruption Extension with their policy will be covered. Our Travel Disruption Extension covers emergency incidents where it's been declared not safe for you to travel, or if you were to get stuck on holiday, due to natural disasters, an outbreak of an infectious disease or terrorism incidents.  If you are travelling to China soon, it's best to check the FCO's travel advice page on their website before you go, just in case the situation changes. If you decide to travel against the advice of the FCO, then your travel insurance would be invalid and wouldn't cover you for cancellation. What does today's pound to euro exchange rate mean for travellers? The Post Office is today offering online rates of 1.1526 for spends of Β£400 or more on euros. This rises to 1.1693 for a spend of Β£500 or more. Meanwhile, euros are offered at 1.1753 for those spending Β£1,000 or more.  Holidaymakers may look to get their holiday Honeywell in advance of the trip in order to make sure they're not stung at the airport. Additionally, it may be that a person considers getting up a currency tracker in order to be alerted about good rates. A currency expert at FairFX recommends keeping a close eye on currency movements in order to help travellers buy at the optimum time. Ian Strafford-Taylor, CEO of FairFX, said: We all expect to pay a little more for convenience, but time and time again we're finding that airport bureau de change desks are ripping off holidaymakers with extortionately high walk-up exchange rates. As families head into Europe over the bank holiday, they risk losing out on valuable extra holiday money by leaving it so late to exchange their cash. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
Jessie Pang,2/21/2020,reuters,Hong Kong protesters mark seven months since brutal mob attack,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests/hong-kong-protesters-mark-seven-months-since-brutal-mob-attack-idUSKBN20F1UR,"Hong Kong protesters, many dressed in black and wearing surgical masks amid fears over the new coronavirus, held sit-ins in the Chinese-ruled city on Friday to mark seven months since an attack by an armed mob on anti-government demonstrators. Protesters gathered in at least two locations, including more than 100 near the northern Yuen Long train station, in the New Territories and near the border with the mainland, where more than 100 white-shirted men beat up black-shirted activists and passers-by on July 21. Police came in for widespread criticism at the time for not preventing the attack, and for not immediately apprehending any of the attackers when they retreated into a nearby village and were surrounded by officers. The protesters chanted slogans on Friday including Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times and Hong Kong independence, the only way out! We will never forget what happened on July 21, said Lily, a protester dressed in black, part of a group of a few dozens at the Causeway Bay metro station on Hong Kong island. We shouldn't forget to resist despite the outbreak of the Wuhan pneumonia, she said, referring to the central city in mainland China where the coronavirus outbreak originated. The Yuen Long violence was one of the highest-profile attacks since protests against a now-withdrawn extradition bill escalated in June last year. The movement has since broadened to include demands for full democracy for the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with protesters angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city's promised freedoms, a charge Beijing denies. Only a very tiny minority are calling for independence. Protests have lost their intensity this year, with many people avoiding large crowds in the densely populated financial hub due to the coronavirus outbreak which has killed two of the 69 patients in the city. But the outbreak has exacerbated anger with the city's leadership and the influence of Communist Party rulers in Beijing. In particular, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's refusal to seal the border with mainland China, seen by many as a move to appease Beijing, has infuriated many. Lam has said a full closure of the border would be impractical, inappropriate and discriminatory and that the government's response to the crisis was based on scientific advice and had no political considerations. There have been sporadic weekend protests drawing hundreds since Hong Kong reported its first patient last month, demanding full closure of the border and opposing some buildings being turned into quarantine centers. These have been largely peaceful. But protesters last month torched the ground floor of one building due to be set up as a quarantine center, forcing authorities to ditch the plan. A Hong Kong police officer was confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus on Friday. The 48-year-old officer had attended a banquet with 59 other police in the island's Western district on Tuesday, police said. Everyone who attended is now quarantined. Television footage showed some protesters popping a champagne bottle to celebrate - the police became a target of protest violence last year amid accusations of brutality, a charge they deny.

He'd practice his calling by going to the henhouse on his family's farm and delivering sermons to his captive flock. Read more from John Blake: Trump called him 'my African American.'

When his chickens were unavailable for worship, he would corral his younger siblings and cousins and preach to them. They nicknamed him ""Preacher."" The Georgia congressman, whose district includes Atlanta, has told the chicken story so much that when a friend invited him to deliver some brief remarks at a reunion of civil rights leaders, he teased Lewis with a warning. ""We told him, 'Forget the chicken. We heard the chicken stories,'"" says Larry Rubin, a former field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), who worked alongside Lewis. ""'You only have five minutes. That chicken story takes 10 minutes.'"" Read More Time is once again pressing on the longtime Democrat, who turns 80 today. Lewis disclosed in December that he's been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer , an aggressive form that sometimes claims its victims within months. Lewis is irreplaceable. He is the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March on Washington. He was on the front lines of the most dangerous campaigns of the civil rights era: the student sit-in movements, the Freedom Rides and of course that notorious 1965 moment at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where Lewis and other marchers were attacked by state troopers with whips and nightsticks.

Hide Caption 44 of 44 Lewis' place in history has been so thoroughly documented that it's hard to find anything new to say about him -- unless you talk to some of the people who have known him the longest. Here are some of their favorite John Lewis stories, plus one gem from a journalist who covered Barack Obama's inauguration. He dressed up at Comic-Con Lewis is often portrayed as a solemn voice of conscience, but friends say he knows how to have fun.  They describe a man who breaks into corny dances, who belts out ""Lean on Me"" at parties and will even do cosplay -- as himself. In 2015, Lewis attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote his graphic novel series, ""March,"" one of which won the National Book Award. But he didn't want to just attend the convention, says Andrew Aydin, co-author of ""March"" and a policy adviser to Lewis. ""I want to dress up,"" he told Aydin. Rep. John Lewis speaks at a panel for his book series ""March"" at Comic-Con International in San Diego. Lewis' costume was a replica of what he wore at the Edmund Pettus Bridge: a trench coat, a backpack containing two books, and a toothbrush and toothpaste. Aydin, a self-professed comic geek, says Lewis quickly got into the spirit of Comic-Con -- even if he didn't know all the characters. ""Who is that?"" he asked Aydin as they passed an attendee with hairy sideburns and blades on his hands. ""Sir, that's Wolverine."" ""Who's that?"" ""That's the Incredible Hulk."" At their Comic-Con panel, something unexpected took place. A group of elementary school students -- children of all races -- came to hear Lewis. After his talk, Lewis decided to join hands with them and stage an impromptu march through the hall. By the time they got to the show floor, Lewis was leading a line of about 1,000 marchers. Some onlookers were near tears as they watched him pass. The graphic novel had made Lewis known to a new generation. ""He was walking through the hallways and the seas just parted,"" Aydin says. ""It felt like it was the first time that people had seen a real hero."" He crossed the aisle to hug a rival The public persona of some civil rights leaders didn't match how they acted backstage when few were looking. Some of the movement's leaders were notorious for their egos, pettiness and their demeaning treatment of women. None of those accusations, though, surface when people talk about Lewis. ""We called Martin Luther King 'De Lawd.' We called Lewis 'the Saint,"" Rubin says. ""John Lewis was John Lewis in all circumstances."" Many of Lewis' political foes also speak highly of him. When Johnny Isakson, the Republican senator from Georgia, was honored last November before his retirement,  Lewis paid an emotional tribute to him on the House floor. Former Rep. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, was Lewis' political foe. But the two men became friends. As he finished speaking Lewis said, ""I will come over to meet you, brother."" He went to Isakson as the Republican, who was battling health problems , walked gingerly towards him. The two men embraced. ""I wish all of America could be here to see that,"" state Rep. Austin Scott said afterwards . George Wallace's daughter made him cry Lewis had another warm embrace for the daughter of one of his most formidable foes, George Wallace, the former segregationist governor of Alabama. When Peggy Wallace Kennedy was invited to Selma to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 2009 with civil rights leaders, she found herself sitting alone in a room as other dignitaries chatted together. Lewis approached her. Peggy Wallace Kennedy at her home in Montgomery, Alabama, on November 22, 2019. ""He saw this person who was nervous and looked unsteady and he come over and said, 'I'm from Pike County,' '' she told CNN. As the civil rights leaders stood for the commemorative march, Lewis told Kennedy, ""Well, sister, it's time for us to move on now."" Lewis held her hand throughout. Several years later, when she returned to Alabama to speak at another civil rights commemorative event, Lewis was on the stage with her. Near the end of her speech, she turned to Lewis and acknowledged he had not been recognized by her late father when he was Alabama's governor. ""But today, as his daughter and as a person of my own, I want to do for you what my father should have done and recognize you for your humanity and for your dignity as a child of God, as a person of goodwill and character and as a fellow Alabamian and say, welcome home."" Lewis arose, walked toward her and grasped her hands. Congressman John Lewis at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. ""Why do you always make me cry?"" she says he said to her. ""Brother, I don't mean to."" ""But sister you do."" Years later, the emotion in Kennedy's voice is still apparent from their encounter. She wrote about Lewis in her recent memoir, ""The Broken Road."" ""He does not have an unlovable bone in his body,"" she says today. He wore his battle scars on his chest Lewis might not have been the most eloquent or physically imposing leader, but he earned respect for something else: His toughness. People recall how he seemed to come to every civil rights meeting with bandages on his head because he was beaten so much. ""People who think of John as cuddly and all of that, I say I want to see how many of them would be fierce enough to deal with the pervasiveness of segregation and stand up to it when standing up meant you got your ass kicked,"" says Courtland Cox, one of SNCC's leaders. Lewis literally wore his beatings on his chest. Each time a SNCC worker participated in a campaign, they received pins or badges. They were like battle ribbons for soldiers, says Cleveland Sellers, another SNCC colleague. Martin Luther King, Jr. locks arms with his aides as he leads a march to the courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 17, 1965. John Lewis is at far right. Lewis had more than anyone else, Sellers says. ""People who had done stuff and showed that they were courageous and were willing to make the commitment -- they got the badges,"" Sellers adds. ""People knew who Lewis was. People respected his story."" Lewis' reputation for risk-taking was so well known that some of his friends couldn't envision a future for him. Says Bernard Lafayette, Lewis' college roommate and a colleague in the sit-in movement, ""I'm surprised that he survived."" He once asked for Obama's autograph Lewis got a chance to see some of his deepest wishes realized when the nation elected its first black president in 2008. According to The New Yorker's David Remnick , Lewis told a visitor at his House office on the day before President Obama's inauguration in January 2009, ""Barack Obama is what comes at the end of that bridge in Selma."" At a luncheon after the swearing-in ceremony, Lewis approached Obama with a commemorative photo and asked for an autograph. President Barack Obama hugs John Lewis during an event marking the 50th Anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 2015. Obama wrote: ""Because of you, John. Barack Obama."" Six years later, the two men held hands as they marched through Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of that bloody moment in history. He's maybe the last of his kind Lewis no longer preaches to the chickens. And he never became that preacher he intended. But he's become a bridge from the optimism of a less partisan era. John Lewis prepares to pay his respects to the late Rep. Elijah Cummings during a memorial ceremony on Capitol Hill on October 24, 2019. He is that rare unifying political figure who commands respect from the left and right, someone who can call his political foes ""brother"" with virtually no one questioning whether he means it. Here's a thought, though, that is almost as unsettling as contemplating Lewis' exit from the national stage: He may be the last such figure we'll see in our lifetime.",general
Jonathan Cable,2/21/2020,reuters,"No extension to EU-UK transition seen, goods trade deal likely: Reuters poll",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-poll/no-extension-to-eu-uk-transition-seen-goods-trade-deal-likely-reuters-poll-idUSKBN20F035,"The transition period for Britain and the European Union to thrash out a trade deal will not be pushed beyond December, according to over two-thirds of economists polled by Reuters, resulting in a goods-only agreement when they part ways. Negotiations on the future relationship are due to start early next month, but the two sides are already digging their heels in, and with less than a year to reach agreement some have questioned whether the time span is realistic. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged the transition period will not be extended beyond December, and 24 of 34 economists polled by Reuters Feb. 17-20 agreed. The UK government is unlikely to want to cross what appears to be such a major red line by agreeing an extension. Instead, the government will likely try and secure a narrow trade deal in areas where the UK's economic interests are best served, said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank. As in all Reuters polls since a narrow majority of Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016, the most likely future trading regime was an EU-UK free-trade agreement, over 90% of those polled said. In second place was no deal and trading under World Trade Organization rules. In last place was for Britain to remain a member of the European Economic Area, which would mean paying into the EU budget to retain access to the single market but having no say over policies. The median chance the transition period ends without a deal rose to 25% from 20% in a poll last month, and economists were less sure if a deal were struck whether it would cover both goods and services. Twenty-one of 34 said it would only encompass goods; 13 said it would also include Britain's dominant service industry. The UK is likely to prioritize manufacturing sectors, in particular, the auto industry, chemicals and machinery. However, trade in services is likely to be excluded, partly due to the complexity and lack of available time, but also due to the fact that the single market for services remains incomplete, economists at Schroders told clients in a note. On Wednesday, a senior EU advisor said the bloc would determine Britain's access to EU financial markets in the same way it has for Japan and the United States, and won't give special treatment. (Graphic: Reuters Poll: EU-UK transition period outlook png link: here) So far, Britain has mostly dodged the coronavirus sweeping across Asia that threatens global growth. Other Reuters polls have suggested the impact from the outbreak on both China and the United States will be short-lived. Market forecasters have largely been ignoring economic data when looking at the UK economy and instead have focused on the twists and turns of negotiations with the EU as they make their predictions. Growth is expected to be modest, with GDP expanding 1.0% this year and 1.4% next, the wider poll of 80 economists found. Inflation will average well below the Bank of England's target this year at 1.6% before rising to 1.9% in 2021. On Jan. 30 - the eve of Brexit - the central bank kept borrowing costs steady at 0.75% as policymakers saw signs of a post-election pick-up in growth, which weakened the case for immediate action. It will stay at that level through to the end of 2021, medians in the Reuters poll found. However, with many risks to the economic outlook, conviction as to where rates would be at the end of this year was low. Thirty-three respondents expected at least a 25-basis-point cut, 39 said there would be no change and two foresaw an increase to 1.0%. The key unknown at present remains the risk the new coronavirus presents to global growth and therefore the UK economy, said Victoria Clarke at Investec. On this, the BoE will maintain its watching brief. For now, we remain relatively comfortable with our judgment that we will not see an adjustment in UK interest rates this year. (Graphic: Reuters Poll: UK economic outlook  link: here) Polling by Md Manzer Hussain and Nagamani Lingappa; editing by Ross Finley, Larry King",business
Josh Horwitz,2/21/2020,reuters,China's ambitious 5G push heading into slow lane due to coronavirus disruptions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-5g/chinas-ambitious-5g-push-heading-into-slow-lane-due-to-coronavirus-disruptions-idUSKBN20F0YF,"Government measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus in China look set to delay the rollout of next-generation 5G telecom networks, a key technology initiative for the country's leadership. Tenders for six big 5G projects have been postponed since Jan.31, government records show. They include an industrial internet project in Guangdong province, a hospital-related project in Jiangxi province, and a police-related project in Gansu province. Two leading providers of crucial fiberoptic cables also have headquarters and key production facilities in Wuhan city, the epicenter of the outbreak which is still under lockdown. In addition to providing much faster internet connectivity, 5G promises to enable a slew of new technology products and services from self-driving cars to intelligent factories. China has made 5G a national priority, aiming to have nationwide networks and services well ahead of other countries and last year it pressed telecom operators to accelerate deployment. Even after the outbreak, President Xi Jinping said in early February that 5G investment might be able to help offset the decline in consumer spending caused by the virus. But like other companies in China, telecom equipment firms and network operators are grappling with a logistical nightmare as travel and quarantine restrictions cause staff shortages and impede the transportation of goods. Yangtze Optical Fibre and Cable Joint Stock Ltd Co, one of two top fibreoptic cable makers based in Wuhan, said in January it would rely on its plants in other parts of China to maintain production. A company manager told Reuters on Thursday that production had not yet resumed in Wuhan and that other factories were operating at 50% capacity. The manager, who was not authorized to speak to media and did not want to be identified, declined to comment on the impact on China's 5G plans. FiberHome Telecommunication Technologies Co Ltd, another Wuhan-based fiberoptic cable supplier, said on its website it was attempting to keep operations going via remote work. Suppliers such as Shengyi Technology Co Ltd, which makes printed circuit boards and copper cables, and Tongyu Communication Ltd, which makes antennas, have said in company filings that production has suffered delays due to the virus. Construction of 5G bases for China Mobile moved quickly in late December and January, local media reports quoted a senior executive as saying last week. But a Beijing division of the country's top carrier also told media that the coronavirus would have a definite impact on the 5G build-out. If the carriers cannot get optical fibers in place, they will probably delay the base station purchases, said Edison Lee, an analyst at Jeffries. China Mobile, rivals China Telecom and China Unicom did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. An executive at Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's biggest supplier of telecom network gear, said this week the company had sufficient equipment stockpiles to last three to six months. In most countries, 5G deployment has not yet begun or is at  a very early stage, with network operators proceeding cautiously in light of the costs and a lack of short-term profit potential.

"Julia Horowitz, CNN Business",2/21/2020,cnn,Morgan Stanley is paying big money for E*Trade. Is that a good idea?,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html," A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . Since the financial crisis, Wall Street banks haven't been too keen on massive acquisitions. That changed this week. Morgan Stanley's $13 billion purchase of online broker E*Trade, announced Thursday, is a huge play that shows how serious the investment bank is about catering to everyday customers. With Morgan Stanley moving to prioritize wealth management, a more reliable source of income than the investment banking and trading operations that made its name, the play makes sense. But whether it will justify the massive price tag ” Morgan Stanley is ponying up a premium of more than 30% ” is an open question. E*Trade shares finished Thursday up nearly 22%, while Morgan Stanley's stock closed 4.6% lower. Read More What Morgan Stanley gains: E*Trade has more than 5.2 million investing clients and over $360 billion in assets. That will bring lots of diversity to the bank's wealth management unit, which currently has 3 million clients and $2.7 trillion in assets, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports. The companies said that once the deal is done, Morgan Stanley will generate about 57% of its pre-tax profits from its wealth management unit, up from about 26% a decade ago. That's not all: Morgan Stanley is also excited about E*Trade's business of managing stock plans on behalf of corporate clients. CEO James Gorman referred to this as a ""killer business"" on a conference call with analysts. This unit has also helped soften the blow from moves by online brokers last year to eliminate commissions on trades. But the cost is raising eyebrows among some analysts ” and because the deal dilutes existing shareholders, it's expected to weigh on Morgan Stanley's stock price in the near term. ""Shares could underperform relative to peers as investors digest the deal,"" Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods told clients. Wells Fargo nears settlements over sales practices Wells Fargo is preparing to settle with US prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission over customer abuses in its banking, auto lending and mortgage businesses, the New York Times reports . The settlements could be announced as soon as Friday. But a number of details remain fuzzy, including the size of the penalties and whether criminal charges would be brought against any individuals. The company has set aside $3.1 billion to pay legal costs related to its sales practices, according to the Times. It wouldn't be the first penalty Wells Fargo faced for its past misconduct: Last month, former CEO John Stumpf agreed to a lifetime ban from the banking industry as well as a $17.5 million fine for his role in the company's fake accounts scandal and other sales practice malfeasance. Wells Fargo's new CEO, Charles Scharf, has so far struggled to right the ship. The bank missed Wall Street's expectations in its most recent quarter, and shares are down 12% year-to-date. The broader KBW Bank Index, meanwhile, is off 3.5%. Top priority: Scharf has made clear that getting the bank out from under the thumb of regulators is essential to getting back on track. ""During my first three months at Wells Fargo, my primary focus has been on advancing our required regulatory work with a different sense of urgency and resolve, while beginning to develop a path to improve our financial results,"" he said when the company released results in January. US dollar: The highest weekly close since 2017? With concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy looming, the US dollar has been on a blitz ” riding high on the relative strength of the US economy and the currency's role as a safe haven asset. The US Dollar Index is on track to finish the week at its highest level since April 2017. That comes at the expense of the euro, which this week hit its weakest level against the dollar in 34 months. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains the phenomenon this way: ""The dollar is king because the US economy is out performing all-comers."" Data on the health of the services and manufacturing sectors for Germany, France and the United States due Friday is only expected to confirm this trend. Why it's important: The strong dollar is yet another risk to corporate earnings during the first quarter, since money that multinational companies make abroad will lose value when converted back to USD. Up next The composite US Purchasing Managers' Index, which looks at the manufacturing and services sectors, arrives at 9:45 a.m. ET. US existing home sales for January posts at 10 a.m. ET.

Jurica Dujmovic,2/21/2020,marketwatch,These are the steps needed for a vaccine to be approved,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are-the-steps-needed-for-a-vaccine-to-be-approved-2020-02-21?mod=your-digital-self,"The Wuhan coronavirus, first reported Dec. 31, has taken 2,130 lives and infected 75,781 people in the process. Thirty countries and territories have confirmed cases of the illness, called COVID-19; despite the containment measures in place, the number is still on the rise, seemingly unfettered. As the outbreak claims more lives and the number of infected continues to grow, pharmaceutical companies, governments, universities and the World Health Organization are working around the clock to develop a vaccine. Once it is eventually developed, tested and administered, a vaccine will enable an individual's immune system to effectively respond to the viral infection, preventing its propagation among the inoculated. Read: China's tourism and automotive industries sink amid COVID-19 outbreak However, devising a vaccine is rarely quick or simple. Historically, the development takes 10 to 15 years . This time, due to a global effort and the virus' similarity to the SARS virus in 2003, the process may be much faster, with estimates ranging from 12 to 18 months. Here's what the development of a vaccine entails: The first stage, also known as the exploratory stage, was made possible in January thanks to Melbourne's Doherty Institute . Researchers in Melbourne were the first to successfully grow the virus outside of China, giving their colleagues in other countries access to live samples and creating prerequisites for the second stage of the development, aka the preclinical stage. Understanding how a virus works ” its characteristics and the way it affects the infected organism ” is crucial in this stage. For this, an animal model is needed. That is, a nonhuman species that shares enough similarities with human organisms for scientists to approximate the effect of the virus on humans. Once a viable vaccine without detrimental side effects is developed based on animal-model research, it is time for stage three: clinical development. Usually, this stage requires some sort of government approval, since it involves testing the vaccine on humans. After the approval has been granted, three trial phases of human testing take place, each broader than the previous. The aim is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, as well as other important information, such as dosage, immunization schedule, rare side effects, etc. Once a vaccine passes all three trials, it has to be approved by a government organization. In the U.S. that would be the Food and Drug Administration, whose Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is responsible for regulating vaccines. The tested and approved vaccine now faces another challenge: manufacturing and quality control. In this final stage, the vaccine needs to be manufactured cost-effectively in mass quantities to satisfy the needs of the global infected population, while (preferably) being submitted to special phase four trials designed to monitor its performance, safety and effectiveness. As you can see, releasing an effective pharmaceutical agent to fight the virus takes considerable effort ” a fact that pharmaceutical companies around the world are well aware of. A growing number of companies have already started forming partnerships to accelerate development or delivery of the vaccine. Clinical Trials Arena lists endeavors from both pharmaceutical companies and research organizations such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the U.S. GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +0.74% , Inovio Pharmaceuticals INO, +8.67% , Innovation Pharmaceuticals IPIX, -1.09% , Moderna MRNA, +7.37% , Novavax NVAX, +12.06% , Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Codagenix are just some of the names working on the development of the vaccine on their own or in partnerships with governments or other companies. So far, 114 medical trials have been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial registry, and this number is only expected to grow as more companies join in the effort to fight the coronavirus. The road ahead is long and rough, but some progress has already been made. Certain HIV drugs have been proven to treat the coronavirus infection , affecting the virus' ability to replicate. Some of these medicines were tested during the 2003 SARS outbreak and are now expected to yield positive results on the new virus, or at least reduce the mortality rate caused by COVID-19. Other approaches include using regular anti-flu medicine and blood plasma transfers between patients who survived the infection and those who are already infected, in the hopes that the transferred antibodies will bolster a body's natural defenses. There have been rumors that a certain 1,000-year-old traditional Chinese herbal medicine called Shuanghuanglian could be effective, but so far, aside from triggering online shopping frenzy by desperate Chinese, these rumors have proven to be untrue . Which method will prove the most successful in eradicating the new coronavirus remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Global pharma is on high alert, and the clock is ticking.

Kate Kelland,2/21/2020,reuters,Could warmer weather help contain the coronavirus?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-explainer/could-warmer-weather-help-contain-the-coronavirus-idUSKBN20F1RG,"Public health officials, businesses and financial markets are looking for signs of whether the arrival of warmer weather in the northern hemisphere might slow the spread of the new coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic. Here's what we know about seasonal features of disease outbreaks. DO WE KNOW WHETHER THE NEW CORONAVIRUS IS SEASONAL? That's what some infectious disease experts are hoping. But they cannot be sure yet because this virus has not been around long enough for scientists to collect the evidence they need. All we have to go on is analogies with other diseases that spread in similar ways, said Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at Britain's University of East Anglia. What specialists do know is respiratory infections like flu, coughs and the common cold can have seasonal influences that make outbreaks of them easier to predict and contain. It's also known that certain environmental conditions can boost transmission of viruses: Cold weather, humidity, and the way people behave during winter can all affect the trajectory of an epidemic. WHAT IS IT ABOUT WINTER THAT HELPS RESPIRATORY DISEASES SPREAD? The reason why cold weather is presumed to cause spreading of coughs, colds and flu is that cold air causes irritation in the nasal passages and airways, which makes us more susceptible to viral infection, said Simon Clarke, an expert in cellular microbiology at Britain's University of Reading. Winter weather also tends to see people spending more time indoors and clustering together. This increases the risk of infection. Many respiratory infections, including COVID-19, are spread in droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to disease experts, when the air is cold and dry, those droplets are more likely to float in the air for longer - travelling further and infecting more people. SO WILL SPRING'S ARRIVAL HELP BRING COVID-19 UNDER CONTROL? It's entirely possible that we might get a spring-time lull, said Clarke. It's unlikely to make things worse, but we don't know for sure - it's an educated guess. Hunter echoes that, saying he thinks it's likely that the disease will decline substantially during the summer months in the northern hemisphere. Whether it comes back again is a moot question, he added. It would not surprise me if it largely disappeared in summer only to reappear again in the winter. Reporting by Kate Kelland; editing by Nick Macfie",business

Photos of the violent demonstrations showed rocks being thrown towards police vans and injured protesters being assisted. Police officers were also left lying wounded on the ground.  People living in the village feared they could become infected despite the authorities repeatedly insisting there was no danger and a special appeal from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for calm. Ukraine has no confirmed cases of the virus. The day-long stand-off which continued into the night saw concerned locals block a bridge leading to the sanatorium where the evacuees will be held for at least two weeks to make sure they are not carrying the virus. Hundreds of helmeted police, police vans and an armoured personnel carrier had been dispatched to keep order.   Officers were periodically shouted at with cries of shame on you as the town waited for the evacuees to arrive. In addition to 45 Ukrainians, there were 27 citizens of Argentina on the plane that landed in Ukraine on Thursday, as well as citizens from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Costa Rica and other countries.

More than 76,700 people have been sickened by the virus, which has killed at least 2,249 people, health officials said. Close to 98% of the reported cases are in China but some officials are worried about a crop of new infections elsewhere, including Iran and South Korea. Airlines around the world, including the three U.S. carriers that serve China ” Delta, United and American ” have halted service to the mainland and Hong Kong because of the virus. In February alone, the number of flights that were scheduled to fly to, from and within China are down 80% from a year ago, according to aviation consulting firm Cirium. From Jan. 23 to Feb. 18, 99,254 scheduled flights didn't fly, close to 90% of them domestic China trips, the firm added. That's sending jet fuel prices, generally airlines' second-biggest expense after labor, down sharply.

Normally, lower costs would be welcome news for airlines, but weaker demand is expected to hit revenue and profits this year. The Asia-Pacific air travel market has become more important since the SARS outbreak that began in 2002. The region accounted for 35% of global demand last year, up from 27% in 2002, the trade group said. China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's largest air travel market by the middle of this decade. Air travel demand globally is set to fall for the first time since 2009 and cost airlines some $29 billion ” mostly in the Asia-Pacific region ” in revenue, the International Air Transport Association said Thursday. Airlines are starting to assess the financial damage. Australia's Qantas warned investors on Thursday that the coronavirus would likely shave off up to $150 million Australian dollars ($99.5 million) from its earnings in the second half of the year and that it would cut 16% of its Asia flights until the end of May. The airline had already suspended its China flights. Air France-KLM, which also suspended China flights, said it expects coronavirus-related demand reductions to drive down results through April by up to 200 million euros ($217 million).",finance

The French spirits maker, which generates 10% of its global sales in China, said it couldn't predict the duration and extent of the impact, but stressed it remained confident on overall strategy. In our view Pernod Ricard deserves credit for attempting to quantify the impact, which few other companies we follow have done, said James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. He added: We don't believe that this should weigh heavily on the shares, albeit China is an important market for Pernod Ricard (we estimate 14% of sales and 20% of EBIT [earnings before interest and taxes]) if the lack of reaction for others in the sector is any guide. Shares in Pernod RI, -0.77% closed up 3.8% on Thursday. Pernod's warning came as the European Union cautioned on Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak had emerged as a new downside risk for the eurozone's growth prospects . In its winter 2019 economic forecast, the European Commission said: The longer it lasts, however, the higher the likelihood of knock-on effects on economic sentiment and global financing conditions. Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for the Economy, added: We still face significant policy uncertainty, which casts a shadow over manufacturing. As for the coronavirus, it is too soon to evaluate the extent of its negative economic impact. Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits group after the U.K.'s Diageo DGE, -1.12% , said operating profit from recurring operations would grow between 2% to 4% this year, down from the 5% to 7% it previously predicted, because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The French spirits maker reported a net profit of β‚¬1.03 billion ($1.12 billion), up 1% from a year earlier, while profit from recurring operations was β‚¬1.78 billion, up 4.3% on an organic basis. Sales reached β‚¬5.47 billion in the six months to Dec. 31, a 5.6% gain on the year earlier, and 2.7% higher on an organic basis.

Makini Brice,2/21/2020,reuters,Trump: U.S. may give farmers more aid until trade deals 'kick in',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-agriculture/trump-u-s-may-give-farmers-more-aid-until-trade-deals-kick-in-idUSKBN20F276,"The United States may give American farmers additional money until trade deals with China, Mexico, Canada and other countries fully go into effect, President Donald Trump said on Friday. If our formally targeted farmers need additional aid until such time as the trade deals with China, Mexico, Canada and others fully kick in, that aid will be provided by the federal government, Trump wrote in a Twitter post entirely in capital letters. It was not immediately clear how large the aid package would be or how long it would last. The Trump administration set aside a $16 billion aid package to farmers in 2019, and $12 billion a year earlier. In January, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said farmers should not expect another bailout package in 2020. Trump is seeking re-election in the Nov. 3 presidential election. Farmers form a key part of his electoral base, but they have been badly bruised by low commodity prices and Trump's tit-for-tat tariff dispute with China. The White House, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Trade Representative's office all declined to comment. Last month, Trump signed a trade deal with Canada and Mexico into law, along with a separate Phase 1 accord with China that went into effect in mid-February. Canada has not yet ratified the deal and experts had been skeptical that China, which had pledged to increase its purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over two years, would be able to meet the goal even before a coronavirus outbreak hit the country's imports and exports.

Manish Singh,2/21/2020,techcrunch,PC shipments expected to drop this year because of coronavirus outbreak,https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/21/pc-shipments-expected-to-drop-this-year-because-of-coronavirus-outbreak/,"The coronavirus outbreak could result in at least a 3.3% drop ” and as high as a 9% dip ” in the volume of PCs that will ship globally this year, research firm Canalys reported Thursday evening in its revised projections to clients. PC shipments will be down between 10.1% to 20.6% in Q1 2020, the firm estimated. The impact will remain visible in Q2, when the shipments are expected to drop between 8.9% (best-case scenario, per Canalys) and 23.4% (worst-case scenario), it said. In the best-case scenario, the outbreak would mean 382 million units will ship in 2020, down 3.4% from 396 million last year. The worst case makes a deeper dent, stating that about 362 million units will ship this year, down 8.5% from last year. In the best-case scenario, production levels are expected to revert to full capacity by April 2020, hence the biggest hit will be to sell-in shipments in the first two quarters, with the market recovering in Q3 and Q4, the firm said. Thus, worldwide PC market shipments are expected to decline 3.4% year on year in 2020, with Q1 2020 down by 10% and Q2 2020 by 9%. PC market supply will normalize by Q3 2020. On a yearly basis, Canalys expects the worldwide PC market will slowly begin its recovery starting in 2021.  The worst-case scenario assumes that production levels will not return to their full capacity by June 2020. Under the assumptions of this scenario, production and demand levels in China will take even longer to recover and Q2 will suffer a decline on a par with Q1 as a consequence. It will be as late as Q4 2020 until we see a market recovery. In either of the scenarios, China, one of the world's largest PC markets, will be most impacted. In worst-case scenarios, the Chinese market will suffer heavily in 2020 under this scenario, with a 12% year-on-year decline over 2019, and subsequent stabilization taking even longer, with 2021 forecast shipments lagging 6 million behind the best-case scenario. The expected CAGR between 2021 and 2024 in China is 6.3%, Canalys stated. China, the global hub for production and supply chain, moved to contain the impact of coronavirus by first extending the official Lunar New Year holidays, which was followed by stringent travel restrictions to keep citizens safe. This resulted in a significant drop in offline retail traffic and a dramatic fall in consumer purchases, Canalys analysts said. The outbreak has also resulted in supply shortages of components, such as PCBs and memory in China and other markets. Likewise, channel partners have received notifications from key PC vendors over the last two weeks that their PC shipments and replacement parts can be expected to arrive in up to 14 weeks “ over three times the usual delivery time “ depending on where partners are located, the firm said. Technology vendors and channel partners in the Asia Pacific region face the unexpected challenge of coping with the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus). The crisis was largely unforeseen, even in mid-January. Most leaders this year were anticipating disruption from political instability and natural disasters, not an epidemic, wrote Sharon Hiu, an analyst at Canalys in a separate report. The outbreak has impacted several more industries, including smartphones, automobiles, television, smart speakers and video game consoles. Foxconn, a key manufacturer for Apple,  said on Thursday that its 2020 revenue will be impacted by Wuhan coronavirus. The firm said its factories in India, Vietnam and Mexico are fully loaded and it is planning to expand overseas. Earlier this month, Apple said it does not expect to meet revenue guidance for March quarter due to constrained iPhone supply and low demand due to the store closures in China. The U.S. giant is expected to miss its schedule for mass producing a widely rumored affordable iPhone, while inventories for existing models could remain low until April or longer, Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday.",tech
Marcus Gilmer,2/21/2020,mashable,Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk face off in crazy 'Star Trek' deepfake,https://mashable.com/article/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-deepfake-star-trek/," The Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk rivalry is moving ahead at warp speed thanks to a new Star Trek deepfake. The video, created by TheFakening, casts Bezos as a member of the alien Talosians, while Musk becomes Enterprise captain Christopher Pike. (The clip comes from the original Star Trek pilot, titled ""The Cage,"" which never aired. Parts of it were repurposed for a later episode of the show titled ""The Menagerie."") In the episode, the Talosians (who use those big brains to project illusions) capture Pike and try to trick him into falling in love with a woman so that he can help breed a new race that will help the Talosians rebuild their destroyed civilization. Given that context, it's pretty clear where TheFakening's preferences lie between Bezos and Musk. As The Verge notes, the clip has been further edited from its original format, removing dialog from other characters. Without better understanding of the full episode, it's probably confusing to most viewers. But the quality of the deepfake won't be lost on anyone. SEE ALSO: Amazon stocks up on Chinese products as coronavirus disrupts supplies It's also not the first time that Bezos has been portrayed as a member of the Talosians. South Park featured the villainous, large-skulled Bezos in the December 2018 episode ""Unfulfilled.""  There's a strong chance TheFakening's video is an homage of sorts to the South Park episode but, either way, Bezos as a Talosian can not be unseen.",tech
Mark DeCambre,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Exclusive: Billionaire Peterffy says Interactive Brokers weighed an E-Trade deal but decided it wouldn't work,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/billionaire-peterffy-says-interactive-brokers-talked-to-e-trade-about-a-deal-but-decided-it-wouldnt-work-2020-02-20,"Interactive Brokers Group Inc. considered merging with E-Trade Financial about merging their brokerage operations but decided the deal didn't make sense, according to Interactive's founder, Thomas Peterffy. Peterffy, a digital-trading pioneer who founded the online platform in 1978, told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Thursday that Interactive Brokers IBKR, +3.58% had weighed a combination with E-Trade ETFC, +0.28% before it agreed to a deal with Morgan Stanley MS, +0.30% MS, +0.30% It didn't work for us because they kept their customer money in long-term government bonds and so that's something we as owners cannot afford to do, Peterffy said, referring to uninvested cash sitting in customer accounts. He said the discussions took place soon after TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp. AMTD, +3.31% announced in November that it would be bought by rival Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, +3.35% in a $26 billion deal . The billionaire founder said that Interactive puts customer money into short-term securities like Treasury bills rather than longer-term securities. The interest from placing clients' uninvested cash can be a profit center for brokers and affiliated banks, especially at a time when commissions at many brokerages have been driven to 0% and on the heels of a trio of cuts by the Federal Reserve to benchmark interest rates, which currently stand at a 1.50%-1.75% range. E-Trade didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal, which broke the E-Trade-Morgan Stanley news , said Morgan Stanley expects to recoup the premium it's paying for E-Trade through $400 million of cost cuts and $150 million in additional savings that will come from using E-Trade's low-cost deposits to replace more expensive funding. Peterffy said Interactive wanted to examine what would happen [if the brokerages combine] and where we would come out. He said as soon as we realized the differences in the yield we would be able to achieve on customers' funds we realized that ETFC would not create a profit at all under our conservative models. Don't miss: Charles Schwab on no-commission trading: Wall Street would have never done this' Also: Schwab to let investors buy and sell fractions of shares In the deal announced Thursday, E-Trade shareholders will get 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares in exchange for one E-Trade share, equal to $58.74 based on its closing price Feb. 19. The deal will significantly increase the scale and breadth of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management franchise, and positions Morgan Stanley to be an industry leader in Wealth Management across all channels and wealth segments, Morgan Stanley said in a statement on Thursday. E-Trade has more than 5.2 million client accounts with over $360 billion of retail client assets, adding to Morgan's existing 3 million client relationships and $2.7 trillion of client assets. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Peterffy described the deal for E-Trade as fair and said his team had arrived at a value not far from what Morgan Stanley plans to pay. Interactive Brokers' market value is more than $28 billion, as of Thursday's close, with Interactive's shares gaining more than 2% on the day, compared with the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.57% Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.60% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.04% , which ended a whipsawing session lower, pulling back from records , amid persistent jitters due to COVID-19, the illness derived from the novel strain of coronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China, last year. The E-Trade deal was hardly a surprise for Wall Street, particularly after the Charles Schwab-TD Ameritrade deal that was announced just weeks after Schwab shook up the sector with the news that it was cutting trading fees for its customers to 0%. Other discount brokerages followed suit, and the deal prompted speculation that more mergers would follow as shrinking fees from commissions would eat into revenue. Peterrfy recalled that Interactive Brokers was the first among the major discount brokers to cut commissions, offering clients the option of either being charged the firm's standard commission or paying no commission. Back in December Peterffy told Barron's in an interview that the TD Ameritrade and Schwab merger would make his firm more of a buyer than a seller. I'm always looking at opportunities, but more as a buyer than a seller, he was quoted as saying. Peterrfy told MarketWatch that he still feels that his brokerage is able to distinguish itself even better now that his shop is among the biggest discount brokers left standing. However, he did say that he would sell Interactive if somebody comes along and gives me an offer I can't refuse. Speculations already is rampant that other smaller brokerage platforms, which cater to a younger demographic, including Robinhood, may be hotly sought after by the likes of Goldman Sachs GS, +0.62% and Bank of America BAC, +1.38% . Peterrfy said that the Morgan Stanley/E-Trade deal represents a very strong competitor to Schwab and Ameritrade, but said that it still makes the distinctions between Interactive and other platforms sharper. He pointed to Interactive's roster of professional investors who trade on average 20 times a month versus an average of about once a month for his competitors. Last year , Interactive tapped Milan Galik as its chief executive, succeeding Peterffy, who remains as chairman. Correction and Amplifications: An earlier version of this story implied that Interactive was in formal talks  with E-Trade about a merger. Interactive considered a deal with the smaller brokerage firm but no formal negotiations took place.",business
Mark Hulbert,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Why bullishness on gold is likely to prompt a drop in prices in coming sessions,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bullishness-on-gold-is-likely-to-prompt-a-drop-in-prices-in-coming-sessions-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"When gold and gold stocks struggle in coming weeks, as I expect they will, it won't be because the COVID-19 threat has decreased. Instead, they will have been sabotaged by the excess bullishness that currently prevails among gold-market investors. This isn't to say a lessening of the virus' threat wouldn't also cause gold to recede from its recent seven-year high . But my argument is that gold will be weak in coming weeks even if the coronavirus remains just as much the public health emergency it is today. Read: Gold breakout's while the stock market is rising should concern investors To appreciate why, consider the average recommended gold market exposure level among several dozen short-term gold timers I monitor (as measured by the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HGNSI). (This average is plotted in the accompanying chart.) It currently is higher than 96.4% of all daily readings of the past 20 years. In the past, whenever the HGNSI has been this high, gold and gold-mining stocks performed poorly on average. The relevant data are summarized in the table below. It shows the returns of gold and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -0.57% in the wake of HGNSI readings as high as we're currently seeing, as well as in the wake of low readings that were just as extreme at the other end of the historical distribution. When HGNSI is ¦ Average gold bullion return over subsequent month Average gold bullion return over subsequent   quarter Average GDX return over subsequent month Average GDX return over subsequent quarter In the 96th or higher percentile -0.10% 0.10% -4.00% -5.60% In the 4th or lower percentile 0.20% 1.10% 0.70% 2.90% Notice that gold bullion's subsequent one-month and three-month returns are flat to sharply lower following extreme levels of gold bullishness. Those are the historical precedents with which the gold market must contend in the next several weeks. By pointing this out, I am in no way trying to minimize the economic consequences of the coronavirus, which are considerable. But, human nature being what it is, investors most likely are overreacting: When things take a turn for the worse, investors catastrophize the situation and think the world is coming to an end ” just as, when things start to look up, investors jump on the bullish bandwagon and think that the market can only go up. The truth, as it always is, is somewhere in the middle. The contrarian bet is simply that sentiment extremes will correct themselves and recede back toward that middle. And that's why you shouldn't be surprised if gold is weak in coming weeks. Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

Malaysia, the world's second largest durian exporter after Thailand, shipped 160.6 million ringgit ($38.61 million) worth of the fruit to China in 2018, according to government data. China's appetite for the Southeast Asian fruit has soared in recent years, with customers paying top dollars for Malaysia's signature Musang King variety and developing a taste for durian-flavoured confectionery. China normally accounts for about 79% of Malaysia's frozen durian exports, but trade has ground to a halt in recent weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak. One top exporter said it expected to lose up to 15 million ringgit ($3.58 million) in the next quarter if normal shipments did not resume soon. Even our downstream products like durian ice cream for the summer season are not moving, said Anna Teo, director of exporter Hernan Corp. If this continues for another one or two months, it'll be a disaster. People seem either to love or hate the king of fruit, as it is known. Durian are banned in some airports, and on public transport and in hotels in many places in Southeast Asia due to their strong smell. But Malaysia has been encouraging large-scale farming and is predicting a 50% jump in exports by 2030 here Durian stall operators in Petaling Jaya, near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, said the number of tourists had plummeted by about 80%, with prices down by about 20% as a result. We can only keep fresh durians here for 36 hours. If we can't sell it, we will peel it and sell the fruit to factories that make paste and other food, said Cheong Tok Kong, the manger of one outlet.

"Michael Nedelman and Ben Tinker, CNN",2/21/2020,cnn,CDC has confirmed 35 cases of novel coronavirus in the US,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/health/cdc-coronavirus-update/index.html," US officials have now confirmed 35 cases of novel coronavirus in the country, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. These include 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 14 US cases. ""We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday. Novel coronavirus deaths top 2,200 as number of new cases in China rises again The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China. There are 10 additional passengers among the Diamond Princess evacuees who tested positive for the virus in Japan, and who Messonnier said will likely be added to the official US count once the Japanese test results have been adjudicated. The 14 US cases include eight in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California. Read More The 13th US case was confirmed Thursday night in Humboldt County, California. County officials offered few details but said a close contact with symptoms was also undergoing testing, and both are self-isolating at home. The 14th case is a Sacramento resident who recently traveled to China, the Sacramento County Department of Public Health announced Friday. Messonnier said there are additional Americans from the Diamond Princess group who remain hospitalized in Japan and are ""seriously ill."" 'A robust inter-agency discussion' On Thursday, The Washington Post reported there had been tensions between the CDC and the US Department of State regarding the decision to allow asymptomatic Americans from the Diamond Princess group who tested positive to board a repatriation flight along with other passengers who had not. A State Department official told reporters Friday that an execution plan was already underway when Japanese lab results became available. What's spreading faster than coronavirus in the US? Racist assaults and ignorant attacks against Asians ""I think the folks on the ground did just the right thing, by -- out of an abundance of caution -- moving those 14 people into an isolation area where they pose no threat to themselves or anyone else, to provide room for a robust inter-agency discussion between not just CDC and state, but really the operational elements of HHS,"" said Dr. William Walters, executive director and managing director for operational medicine at the State Department's Bureau of Medical Services. In total, more than 300 US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess were repatriated on two flights chartered by the State Department. ""At the end of the day, the State Department had a decision to make, informed by our inter-agency partners, and we went ahead and made that decision,"" Walters said. ""And the decision, I think, was the right one in bringing those people home."" Messonnier said, ""These are difficult decisions that we're faced with every day, and we're making those decisions in real time."" She added, ""We are one US government, working together,"" but that the focus going forward will be on the health of repatriated US citizens and continuing the overall coronavirus response. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. That response, she said, involves not just looking for new cases of coronavirus, but preparing for what happens if the virus spreads in the United States. This includes working with partners in the medical supply chain to make sure health care systems are well-stocked, and working with hospitals across the country to ""plan for surges of people seeking and requiring care,"" Messonnier said. ""This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,"" she said. ""We are now taking and will continue to take unprecedented, aggressive action to reduce the impact of this virus ... on the communities in the US.""",general

"Morningstar, Inc.",2/21/2020,morningstar,Coronavirus Wreaks Havoc on Airlines ” WSJ,https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202002211757/coronavirus-wreaks-havoc-on-airlines-wsj,"This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (February 21, 2020). HONG KONG -- Airlines around the world are counting the cost of the coronavirus that has led to thousands of China flights being canceled, with several Asian airlines teetering on the brink of ruin if the nation's shutdown persists. Many carriers have taken emergency measures in hope of offsetting expected losses resulting from the continuing slump in global traffic. In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. -- already feeling the impact of the city's antigovernment protests -- has asked all its staff to take three weeks' unpaid leave, while Hong Kong Airlines Ltd. has sacked more than 400 workers. Asiana Airlines Inc., South Korea's second largest carrier, also asked thousands of staff to take unpaid leave. Even flights not passing through China have been axed from schedules. Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. said Thursday it was reducing services to Hong Kong and Singapore in addition to suspending flights to mainland China until at least the end of May, while Thai Airways International PCL has cut flights connecting Bangkok with Seoul and Singapore, as regional customers lose their appetite for travel. China's rise to the world's second busiest aviation market after the U.S. has been a strong source of growth for all the world's major airlines, which have expanded direct services to Chinese destinations in recent years, some offering dozens of flights a week. American Airlines Group Inc.'s namesake carrier, for example, normally operates 28 weekly flights between the U.S. and China. But that has left them badly exposed to major disruption in China. As the epidemic worsened, many foreign airlines, including the major U.S. carriers, completely halted flights to Chinese destinations last month. China's own airlines have become some of the world's biggest, establishing a global footprint. All have slashed services over the past month as the country battles the epidemic, which by Wednesday had infected 74,576 and killed 2,118 people in mainland China, according to the official count. With millions of Chinese people facing travel restrictions and many others simply avoiding nonessential travel, regional demand for flights has collapsed, forcing carriers to cancel over 25,000 flights a week in total, according to aviation data company OAG. The number of seats available on domestic Chinese flights fell 63% year-over-year to 5.4 million in the second week of February, OAG said. And many of those seats were empty, with daily passenger numbers down 91% on year as of Monday, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. ""No event that we remember has had such a devastating effect on capacity, "" OAG's senior analyst John Grant wrote in a Feb. 17 commentary. While the SARS outbreak of 2003 also hit aviation companies hard, the Chinese air-travel sector has since grown 10-fold, making the coronavirus a critical issue even for airlines based outside Asia. The airline industry stands to lose $5 billion in revenues in the first quarter, the International Civil Aviation Organization estimates. As of Feb. 14 Chinese airlines had refunded over $2.85 billion to passengers unable to take canceled flights, according to the CAAC. While China's three big state-run carriers -- Air China Ltd., China Eastern Airlines Corp. and China Southern Airlines Co. -- are strong financially, some smaller players will struggle to sustain the crippling of their operations for long, said Paul Yong, an analyst at DBS Bank in Singapore. Hainan Airlines is especially vulnerable, he said, thanks to the well-publicized debt struggles of its parent, HNA Group Co. The government could take the crisis as its cue to intervene and allow the big three to carve up Hainan Airlines' routes -- a move that was the subject of industry rumors long before the coronavirus epidemic began. Earlier this month Hong Kong Airlines, another HNA unit, said it would sack at least 400 of its 3,500 employees and ask others to take unpaid leave as it struggles to weather the crisis. On Wednesday it said it would eliminate all in-flight services in a further cost-cutting measure. Hainan Airlines and Hong Kong Airlines didn't respond to requests for comment. The region's low-cost carriers are also vulnerable to prolonged disruption, aviation analysts say. ""It becomes a question of who has the strongest balance sheets,"" said Mr. Yong. ""We could potentially see some smaller players going bankrupt."" Thailand's Nok Air, a budget carrier that has grown partly off the back of a boom in Chinese people vacationing in Thailand, looks shaky, he said; 10 of Nok Air's 19 overseas destinations are cities in China. VietJet is another Asian low-cost carrier heavily dependent on Chinese travelers: 10 of the 20 destinations it serves outside Vietnam are Chinese. The number of flights from China to Thailand and Vietnam were down 60% and 84% respectively in the second week of February compared with last year, according to OAG. Nok Air and VietJet didn't respond to requests for comment. Larger carriers have also been scrambling to insulate themselves against the continuing slump in Chinese traffic. Cathay Pacific's request that all employees take three weeks' unpaid leave for the rest of 2020 came after the airline cut 90% of its flights to the mainland, accounting for roughly a third of its total capacity. Cathay Pacific was already reeling from a backlash among Chinese customers over its perceived support for the protests in Hong Kong. That led to a slump in the airline's China business and to the resignations last year of its chairman and chief executive. Asiana Airlines said Tuesday that it was asking thousands of staff to take unpaid leave after it was forced to reduce its China services by over 70%. The airline, which lost $562 million in 2019, faces ""a crisis of a massive operating loss this year"" because of the epidemic, the Yonhap news agency quoted Chief Executive Han Chang-Soo as saying.

My name is Cheryl, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fastly Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Maria Lukens, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hey, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. We have Fastly's CEO, Joshua Bixby; Chief Architect and Executive Chairperson, Artur Bergman; and CFO, Adriel Lares with us today. Before they start, I want to remind everyone about the format of our call. We published a Shareholder Letter on our Investor Relations website and with the SEC about an hour ago. We hope everyone had a chance to read it. Since the letter provides a lot of details, we will make some brief opening remarks and reserve the rest of the time for your questions. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, long-term growth and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied during the call. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC and our Q4 2019 Shareholder Letter for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also note, that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Also, during this call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the Shareholder Letter in our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call is being webcast and will be archived on our website shortly afterwards. With that, I'll turn the call over to Artur. Thank you, Maria. Hi, everyone, and welcome. We appreciate you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year of '19 -- 2019 results. Before we discuss those, I want to talk about some exciting news announced earlier today that will position us for the next stage of fastest growth. I have decided to step into the full-time role of Chief Architect and Executive Chairperson and Joshua Bixby is Fastly's new CEO. These past nine years, having an incredible journey, I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We are at the product inflection point, similar to the inflection point we were at nine years ago when we started Fastly. Compute@Edge is both a result of my and our CTO, Tyler McMullen's vision nine years ago and the paradigm shift in how apps are built today. Just as we had to show the world that the edge cloud was the right way to build better online experiences. We now have to expand that vision further, the edge should be easily used, have security integrated and we have continued to evolve and develop it. We see so much potential for secure edge computing environments in the market and we are building the future of our platform closely with our developer community. We have continued to receive positive feedback on Compute@Edge which is currently in beta. The feedback we are receiving enables us to continue iterating improving the product in order to drive transformation at edge. We also have to continue adapting our modern network to meet the new demands of Compute@Edge. We want to keep -- being as efficient, if not, more with Compute@Edge as we have been in the past. I have planned to spend more time with customers and prospects to understand their needs and to educate them on what's possible with edge computing. The reason I can make this transition is because Joshua and I have worked together for over six years. We have built trust together and I believe that Joshua is the right person to lead Fastly into the future. Joshua knows our business in and out. Having spent time running different parts of the business, and also a unique ability to know what type of people, systems and organization are needed for us to grow. He cares deeply about our employees, partners, customers and investors. I will continue to work very closely with Joshua and the rest of the leadership team helping support the long-term strategic direction of the Company, and I look forward to keep interacting with you all about the Fastly future. Please join me in congratulating Joshua in his new role. And I'm now turning over to him, so that he'll go over the results. Thank you, Arthur. It's been amazing to help grow Fastly with you for over six years. It is an incredible honor to lead and serve Fastly. We are on an exciting journey to build a more trustworthy Internet and I am energized to continue our momentum. 2019 was a great year for Fastly. This quarter brings us to the end of our first calendar year as a public company. We launched several innovative new products and features that excite and benefit our customers and our community. Our customers are motivated to create and build on the edge. We continue to differentiate from our competitors and we continue to see growth across our global customer base, across all verticals and geographies. As you saw in our Shareholder Letter, we had a strong fourth quarter and are excited to share the results. We generated $59 million in revenue, up 44% year-over-year. Our results reflect increased adoption of our edge cloud platform, including our security products by both new and existing enterprise customers. We are making progress on the path toward profitability and continue to identify opportunities to drive operating leverage as our network scales. We believe over the next decade developers will move more and more mission critical functions to the edge, driven by the need for performance, scale and security, as the world around us continues to be digitized. As such, we believe the programmability and security will be paramount. In 2019, we made significant progress and are excited to carry that momentum into 2020. As we look forward to this year, we are focusing on furthering our mission and providing an edge cloud platform that developers can adopt as their own, which will include delivering a feature rich Compute@Edge offering at scale and continuing to invest in our edge security portfolio. Fastly is on a great trajectory and we remain poised to do so much more. With that, I'll hand the call over to Adriel, who will walk through some financial highlights. Thanks, Joshua, and congratulations. I look forward to continuing my partnership with you and your new role. As Joshua mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum in growth and the top line during the fourth quarter and calendar year 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $59 million, up 44% year-over-year. Full-year 2019 revenue was $200 million, up 39% year-over-year. We also continue to experience strong customer growth among both new and existing customers. Enterprise customer count grew to 288, up from 274 in Q3 with average enterprise customers spend also increased in the $607,000, up from $575,000 in the previous quarter. This resulted in enterprise customers generating 87% of our trailing 12-month total revenue, up from 86% last quarter. Our dollar-based net expansion rate was a 136%, also up from the previous quarter which was 135%. Our annual revenue retention rate also increased to over 99%. In 2020, we are focused on continuing to further strengthen our customer relationships through our land, adopt and expand approach, whereby customers adopt Fastly for one particular use case and then incorporate additional Fastly products and features over time. We also continue to drive margin expansion in the fourth quarter and 2019 as we continue to pursue leverage opportunities in the business. GAAP gross margin was 56.7% for the quarter, up from 56.6% in the year ago period and 55.9% for the full year, up from 54.7% in 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation that has increased significantly in 2019 as a public company relative to 2018 while we were private, was 57.6% for the quarter, up from 56.8% the year prior. And full-year non-GAAP gross margin was 56.6%, up from 54.9% in 2018. As we have said in previous quarters, our gross margin can be impacted by the timing of personnel and infrastructure investments, as well as the seasonal ramp of usage and requests by our customers on our platform. All that being said, we still remain confident that we can continue to drive gross margin expansion over time. Lastly, despite ramping investments across sales, R&D and G&A as our first -- in our first year as a public company, we were also able to deliver operating leverage in the fourth quarter and in the full-year of 2019. We are pleased with the progress we have made so far and look forward to the opportunities ahead. I'd now like to move to our Q1 and full-year 2020 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $58 million to $60 million, non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $13 million to $11 million and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.11. For the full-year 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $255 million to $265 million, non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $43 million to $33 million and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.43 to $0.32. I'd also like to take a second to comment on the potential impact of the COVID-19 virus on our business. The situation continues to evolve and the magnitude of the overall impact on our business cannot be reliably quantified at this time. But we have seen no material effect at this time. For example, at some point we might see a negative impact to our supply chain, but again, nothing has yet occurred. Conversely, Internet usage may also increase. In closing, we had an excellent quarter and we are pleased to have close out our first calendar year as a public company with strong execution. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for some Q&A. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Van Rhee of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats on real nice quarter there. First, maybe you can just talk about the pipeline in terms of what you are seeing? How does the forward pipeline look versus what you have been closing with respect to use cases, verticals, competitors, just talk about kind of what's changing at the edge? Hey, Jeff, it's Joshua. Thanks for the question. I think that, as we talked about in previous calls, 2019 was a year of investment on the marketing side and we are starting to see that pay off. So I think we have seen an expansion in that pipeline across all the verticals, all the geographies. I think we are -- we have not seen a dramatic change to the competitive environment. We continue to see the dominant player continue to see them quite often and the legacy CDN players. From a geographical and vertical perspective, it really remains the same. I think we -- I would add that we continue to see strong growth across all verticals and all geographies and that's pretty universal. It's a good time right now. And, I guess, just as it relates to the role shift, I mean, congratulations to both. It sounds like it -- you're both pretty pleased about where it's going to take you. Artur, I'm interested just in terms of your thought process and the timing that brought you to this conclusion? I'm sure it didn't just happen right here. How has this evolved, how have you been thinking about this over time? Thank you. I'm very excited and happy. It's evolved over quite a while where my and Joshua's partnership has been very close. And he's taken over larger parts of the business. And I kind of felt that, as we keep growing, the stuff that I really love to do and that I'm very good at, I will actually have less and less time with and because I love to explore this change and then we executed on it. I'm so excited about the Compute@Edge and I just want to spend more time with our engineers and our customers, get back out into the field. And those who learn what they want and tell them what they can do, kind of what we did eight years ago. And so, that's really the evolution of that. Great. That's helpful. Last one for me, just maybe this is for Adriel. As you look at the annual outlook, how did you approach, obviously, in your elections, Olympics, some of the seasonal demand, maybe ask differently what kind of uplift would it typically bring in a given year and how variable can that be, what did you bake into the guide for that? Yeah. Generally, we found historically an election year is a good thing. I think one thing that impacted my sort of guide is the fact that this is the earliest we have ever guided as a public company. So we got a full year in front of us. And the fact that we are a usage base, there is some variability that can occur. And so, I think what you saw there is, we just finished a great year, a great quarter and what you see here is just some appropriate conservatism given that we are just this early in the year. But generally, given what you see in terms of the year on your growth rate with the midpoint there, I think it's still feel generally positive about where we are going. And I think you just sort of see an appropriately wider band just to make sure that we can account for some of the uncertainties associated with usage. Okay. Got it. Great. Thanks, again. Congrats everybody. Your next question comes from Will Power of Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Charles Erlikh -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Charlie Erlikh on for Will. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on strong finish to the year. I was wondering if you could update us just on your marketing and sales hiring progress. How have the employees that you hired in the end of 2019 started to ramp? And could you maybe talk a little bit about your plans in terms of sales and marketing hires into 2020? Sure. This is Adriel, and thanks for the question. So, overall, we're pleased with the investment that we ended the year with, we were sort of targeting that sort of 35% as a percentage of revenue and we will likely continue to do that so long as we feel like we are getting the return on investment that we have experienced in the past and 2019 was no different and just affirmed the return on those investments. From a hiring standpoint, and we were able to get sort of our 60 revenue generating folks here, so we are pleased with that. And I think what you should see from us going forward is continued sort of invest at the current rate we have seen before. I think we are continuing to -- we are still early days into the marketing portion of that sales and marketing spend, and we were going to continue to monitor that return on that as we progress into 2020. But so far I want to make sure we -- looks as though we want to continue to maintain that rate. Charles Erlikh -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Great. That's helpful. And then just one more for me, I wanted to clarify the comments you made in the Shareholder Letter about the cadence of gross margins through the year. Is there anything out of the ordinary there? Because it would seem that Q1 usually should be seasonally weaker than Q4 just due to less traffic leverage. So, is there anything that you are calling out that's unique to Q1 '20 that's not necessarily typical normal seasonality? No. I think you've said it correctly. In Q4, as we talked about in the past, seasonally it's probably our strongest quarter. There's lots of good live events that we can participate in to compete for and bid for. There's also great shopping from our e-commerce customers, there's just the general holiday season helps us in Q4 and then some of that doesn't repeat itself, it will carry over into Q1, so you should see some differences there. But it becomes that the same trend follows into 2020. We sort of see that sort of seasonal strength as we enter the fourth quarter again this year. Charles Erlikh -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Got it. All right. Thanks, Adriel. Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Excellent. Thanks so much and I echo my congrats all around on a good quarter and congrats on some of the changes in the leadership organization. But if I could follow-up on a question on gross margins, I wanted to touch on the live streaming events in the quarter. So you called out the impact to gross margin in the letter, but I was wondering if you could help us quantify the impact and how we should think about the pace of expansion into 2020 with multiple live events ahead from the Olympics to various political events and how you are thinking about that. Sure. This -- Brad, this is Adriel again. I think the biggest thing we were focused on, we've talked about in past earnings calls and publicly is, we're trying to grow annual overall gross margin incrementally and I think this year we were really aiming for about 100 basis points sort of on a year-on-year basis so we are pleased we are able to do that. And I think going forward that should still be the case. In particular, in Q4, there were just normal timing-related impacts as we build up or not only live events in Q4, but also in preparation for live events that would have occurred here in Q1. Super Bowl was namely one of them. And so, there's nothing, I think, unusual in that regard. And I think from our standpoint, we're constantly balancing investments that we make today in preparation for the growth of our customers. As you can see, with the 44% year-on-year, it's a little bit tougher when you're growing as fast as they are. And I think on our side we are trying to balance our margin expansion goals with sort of the revenue opportunity that we see in front of us. So, I hope that gives you a little bit more color in terms of sort of the quarter itself but year-on-year I still feel good about how we did in 2019 and I feel confident about what it would do in 2020. Thanks, Adriel. It's very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for whomever wants to take it, I guess. At last year's Altitude, you highlighted real time ad insertion as an initial use case for Compute@Edge. And as we move into the rest of this year and I know it's still early, right. But how have conversations around the technology progress then -- and in terms of that use case, has it actually been implemented anywhere into production yet or is it still way too early? Hey, Brad, it's Joshua here. It's still too early. We're still in beta with that. I think that the progression has been very positive. This notion that the Edge brings the power to do more and it is very powerful and I think the ad insertion story is particularly powerful. I mean, we continue to see scenarios where most of that traffic is not being served from the edge and therefore, is penalized from a performance, scale and security perspective. In the case where that would be dynamic, we could see things that are very personalized. And we are very bullish about that use case, but there are many others that are emerging as we've taken this out. And as you've seen in the past, we are very thoughtful about how we roll these products out, given that we are a platform built by developers for developers. We really want to capture the power of that their imagination and we do that very thoughtfully. And I think that's part of what we have seen over the last few months is the excitement around that. And as we have talked about previously and I have said in the opening remarks, our goal this year is to bring out Compute@Edge at scale, and that is -- that remains the case and I think we are even more excited than when we first brought out the beta with the type of creativity that our customers have. That's one of the wonderful assets of our businesses that we built on the -- people build on the shoulders of others and we continue to see that momentum, it's beautiful. Awesome. We are excited for it too. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continued strong results. Maybe first I wanted to start by the capex for next year, in the Shareholder Letter you talk about it kind of staying at a little bit of an elevated level above that long-term outlook. Can you maybe help us understand where do you see that continued capex going? And how you look at the potential return on that? And then I've got a follow-up. Sure. Rishi, it's Adriel again. So, we are pleased with the outcome of 2019, where we ended up at about 10% of capex turn [Phonetic] of revenue. And I think from our standpoint, here internally we work on different ways to finance and also to plan when we bring in capex and sort of the just in time notion, while still providing capacity for our future growth. But as I have mentioned earlier, the growth aspect, given how faster customers are going, is a bit of a challenge, which is why I'm giving ourselves a bit of room here with sort of like 13% to 14% for 2020. Clearly, we will try to be beat that as well and do whatever we can to sort of get just in time, with respect to deployment of our capex. But that just gives you some context of that. Again, we -- I think we outperformed relative to what I thought we would do in 2019. Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Okay. Thanks, Adriel. That's helpful. And then just in the commentary around the revenue in Q4, including some one-time live events aren't expected to carry over. Can you maybe help us understand the magnitude of that or quantify how much of a revenue impact those were? Thanks. Yeah. I think it was a little bit of like strong growth into new live events that we had never been exposed to, not unlike how Super Bowl for this year is our second year doing that. So we are getting exposed to greater and greater opportunities as a result of the success we've had in the past. So when I say one-time, I think it's more of the sense that it's Q4 typically is when those sports are played or when those events are occurring, we were going to continue to compete for them on an annual basis. But from a Q4 to Q1, I mean, that from sort of a seasonal standpoint. Rishi Jaluria -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. Let me echo my congratulations to both of you as well in the new roles. Just maybe starting out with you Josh, now that you are in sort of the new role, can you talk a little bit about, maybe what you see as some new opportunities or maybe some things that you can do to drive either changes or improvements? Jonathan. Thank you. I think Artur said this very well, which is, this has been a partnership for over six and a half years. So the decisions that we've made in this business I feel like we have made together. And I think as you can see from the quarter and the year, Fastly is thriving. So I don't -- this is not about change. I think this is about augmenting and enhancing all of the areas that we have already talked about. Fastly is a platform for developers and I think Compute@Edge obviously is the next-generation of that, so that is a core focus, and I think we just need to continue to augment and actually part of this shift is to allow Artur to spend more of his time in that area. I think the other thing that I called out is that, security continues to be more important for our customers and we continue to invest heavily there. And I think that's also in area that Artur is going to continue to augment. Other than that we are very proud of the results and we think that this is just about continuing to grow at a wonderful phase, and nothing is broken here, this is a wonderful time and a wonderful place to be for us. Got it. Got it. And then just in terms of the DBNER results, that accelerated sequentially. And so, I just wanted to get a sense from you, is there any way to maybe break down some of the drivers of that DBNER expansion between the different use cases, whether it's Edge or security or core? Just to give us a sense of maybe what's driving what. Thank you. Hey, Jonathan. It's Adriel. Yeah. With respect to DBNER, that's another one of those that continues to please me in a good way. And even though I've talked in the past how eventually I expect that to meter down a little bit just with sort of large numbers. But in terms of where the main driver is coming from, it really is across the board. I think it's also that in context with the fact that we are releasing on an annual basis or retention rate that bumped up from an already high 98% to 99%. I think all of that together really does show that the sort of this land, adopt and expand strategy with Fastly is across all of our different customers. So it's not any one particular segment. Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Timothy Horan -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst Thanks, guys. Can you give a little more color on Compute@Edge kind of what you are seeing in the marketplace? Are you seeing any competitors trying to adopt this and how far ahead of your competitors you think you are? And maybe just some of the competitions you are having on new applications and services that customers really like? And I'm assuming some of your security services are based on this architecture, maybe you can talk about some of those on the security what you are good at or different at? Thank you. Yeah. Hi. Thank you. It's Artur here. I mean, there's much to significant to update compared to the last quarter. We don't -- we see a couple of -- we see some competitors that are trying to say that they are entering this market. We are not really seeing that when we are talking to our customers from a scalability and performance flexibility point of view. So we think -- we feel really good about the core technology around how the isolation and sandboxes are working, and we are engaging with some very large prospects or existing customers and making sure that they meets older security compliances. Now, the interesting twist right has been around the issues that Intel and AMD have had over the last couple of years with regards to leakage between different -- like different memory parts like Spectre and Meltdown and so on. And this gives this an opportunity to -- from ground up try to avoid and combat those kind of data leakage vulnerabilities, and that's one of the things that we have been in deep conversations with some of our customers about and how to ensure that they are happy and have safe environment for their critical data. And on the application side, it's the same I was talking to, I mean, this is a brand-new thing for our customers to do. So it's taking some time for them to start really evaluating and integrating and adding this to the roadmap. On the security product side, the security products aren't yet based on this technology. But the new security products that we would develop or -- and the ones that we have will be migrating to use this technology over time. One of the benefit for us as well with Compute@Edge is that, not only can our customers innovate on the edge faster and safer, so can we. And so, we can have more flexibility in allowing our product and R&D department in coming up with new products and releasing them quicker and seeing how they work. So, we will probably have significantly more update around this for Altitude later this year. Timothy Horan -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst Your next question comes from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Congrats all around for Josh for the promotion and Artur for the new -- moving into the new role and just the overall results in Q4. I'm a little surprised, it hasn't gotten mass at this point, but I guess, how much of an impact with the new streaming services out in Q4 have on the business in the quarter itself? And then, Adriel, specifically, how are you guys thinking about how those new services could impact the business in terms of the guidance in 2020? James, it's Joshua. I'll handle the first question and hand it off to Adriel. I think that there has been a lot of press around new streaming services, obviously, and we get asked a lot of questions in this regard. One of the things that we've always talked about is, we are not a business that relies on large events and streaming to as the sort of the dominant grower in our business. We do help our customers with everything that they do. But as you know, we really focus on the high-margin side of that. And one of the trends that we are seeing and continued to see in 2019 is our non-media -- the non-media part of our business, which continues to grow as a percentage of revenue. So we are actually seeing notwithstanding any of the growth in the media sector. We are continuing to see extending growth and continued growth in the non-media business, which I think is important overall. So, I would say, there are customers out there who really value high-performance and who really value quality. And if you look at where Fastly plays, it is in that side of the market. But, as I say, as a percentage of revenue and overall that is becoming less of our business overtime. And Adriel -- I'll hand it over to Adriel for the second part. Thanks, Joshua, and thanks for the question, Jim. I -- within that range, which is $5 million up and $5 million down from $250 million [Phonetic] midpoint. There is some growth in there some sort of the higher end. But there -- as to Josh was point, I think strategically either have some mix of sort of media business within our business model, which enables us to build this really fantastic network that allows us to sort of deliver lots of features to many of our non-media enterprise customers. So there's some built in there. Again, I'm not -- we're not sort of counting on that as sort of our core business for growth, but it is an aspect to it. Hopefully, that answers your questions, if not, a sort of a big dependence so to speak. Got it. No. No. I think I get what's going on. And then just one more for me is the enterprise net ads are consistently in the low- to mid-teens here, yet some of your peers are adding kind of multiples more customers at this kind of similar level. I guess, why can't you guys add more, is the low hanging fruit kind of hit a wall? Hey, Jim. It's Adriel again. So I'll start and I think Joshua may want to add on to this, which is, if you think about the average size of our enterprise customers, those that bill greater than $100,000, that's now up to $607,000. These are pretty significant and sophisticated customers. And I think from our standpoint, I'm pleased with how much they are utilizing now and how that flex itself, not only in the average spend per customer, but also it reflects the DBNER and also our overall revenue growth. So from our standpoint, we really are trying to add these more sophisticated higher end enterprise customers that really do take advantage of our edge cloud that we have out there and then ultimately the edge -- the Compute@Edge that we are working on as we speak. So I think there's a bit of time that takes to get these customers, but we are continuing to invest into the marketing side of the house, which is relatively new and this is an area that I know Joshua is intimately involved with help setting up. Yeah. Just one more element, I think, people use different calculations with this metric as well. What's important about understanding our metric is that, it is a backwards looking metric. So we are looking back in the past to understand this. We know that other organizations are sort of projecting forward and I think like always we are going to take a conservative approach, not try to predict the future, but to give you a picture of what's actually happened. Got it. That makes a ton of sense, guys. Thanks and congrats again. Your next question comes from Michael Turits of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, everybody. Good evening, and ",business

Kramer Sr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. In my comments this afternoon, I'll provide a brief recap of what was accomplished during 2019 and then turn to our strategic plans and expectations for 2020 and beyond. As we look back at the year just completed, I think there are three key takeaways. First, we effectively executed on our strategy of building and strengthening our leadership positions in the public health threat markets we compete in. Secondly, we continued to progress strategic R&D investments, which we will expect to contribute to longer-term revenue growth. And third, we made prudent investments to build scale and key functions to better leverage our core competencies for sustainable competitive advantage. Let me take a few minutes and expand on each of these three points, starting with strategy execution. In 2019, we initiated deliveries of our next-generation anthrax vaccine candidate AV7909, beginning the transition from BioThrax to AV7909 as the cornerstone of the U.S. government's preparedness efforts against the threat of anthrax. Related to this, BARDA exercised its first contract option for 10 million doses of AV7909 to be delivered over a 12-month period valued at approximately $261 million. Next, we made great strides with our smallpox franchise. We secured a $2 billion, 10-year procurement contract for the continued supply of ACAM2000, the only single-dose FDA-approved smallpox vaccine and the U.S. government's principal response tool against the threat of smallpox. We also secured a $535 million, 10-year contract for the continued supply of VIGIV, our FDA-approved therapeutic for smallpox vaccine complications. Next, we secured a $90 million commitment as part of an anticipated $490 million, 10-year commitment from the U.S. government for the continued to supply of BAT, our FDA-approved botulism antitoxin. And finally, we completed the integration of the PaxVax and Adapt Pharma acquisitions and continued to invest in and further scale the travel health and NARCAN Nasal Spray franchises. So to summarize, during 2019, we successfully strengthened our leadership positions across our portfolio of products by securing over $3 billion worth of long-term procurement contracts with the U.S. government. As a result, we now have three key medical countermeasure franchises, those being anthrax, smallpox and opioid overdose reversal, each of which are in a position to generate in excess of $215 million in annual revenue, a clear follow through on our commitment to profitably grow revenue while diversifying our product and customer mix. The second key takeaway relates to R&D. During 2019, we made significant progress in our R&D portfolio, advancing a number of product candidates through various stages of development. This included initiating a Phase 3 study for AV7909, completing a Phase 2 study for our FLU-IGIV seasonal influenza A therapeutic, completing the interim analysis of a Phase 4 pediatric study for our approved cholera vaccine, Vaxchora, advancing various auto injector based programs addressing chemical threats and furthering various drug device combination programs addressing the opioid crisis. We also presented updated results from our Phase 2 study of our chikungunya vaccine candidate, and more recently received alignment of both EMA and FDA to pursue our development program for a Phase 3 study involving the use of a surrogate endpoint of efficacy. We anticipate initiating this Phase 3 study later this year. The last takeaway relates to scale. During 2019, we made significant progress in further scaling our business through targeted investments in people, capabilities and infrastructure to continue to drive top and bottom line growth over the long term, while at the same time managing our expense base. The strong execution against our operating goals translated equally into strong financial results. On the top line, we recorded over $1 billion in revenue, which marks the achievement of a corporate goal one year in advance of what we set out to do when we first established the goal in 2016. Notably, revenue grew over 40% as compared to 2018 as we fully integrated the PaxVax and Adapt acquisitions, drove organic growth and executed numerous contracts as I just outlined. We also generated strong profitability with year-over-year increases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income of 40% and 24%, respectively. As we closed the chapter on 2019, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the leadership team and my 1,800 colleagues at Emergent for the extraordinary progress we achieved as a company over the course of the year. As a result of their hard work and efforts, we're entering 2020 with momentum and with confidence. So let's look forward a bit and talk about 2020. As we discussed at our November Analyst and Investor Day, we intend to once again double our revenues over the next five years between 2020 and 2024, while remaining disciplined as we manage this growth. Our strategy includes expanding our leadership positions in current and new public health threat markets and continue to make investments in capabilities, innovation and operational excellence. This strategy is centered on five core principles. First, executing our core business. Second, growth through M&A. Third, strengthening our R&D portfolio. Fourth, building scalable capabilities. And fifth, continuing to evolve our culture. With that as a backdrop, for 2020, we've established ambitious financial goals, which Rich will further touch on in his prepared remarks. We've also established a variety of operational goals for the coming year, which will drive the continued growth of the Company. This is where I like to spend the balance of my time in prepared comments. Beginning with our anthrax vaccines, which are elements of our broader franchise in anthrax, we plan to ship doses of both BioThrax and AV7909 over the course of the year, thereby continuing to support the U.S. government's ongoing preparedness against the threat of anthrax, while supporting the ongoing transition in the stockpile from BioThrax to AV7909. The exact mix of the two products and the timing is dependent upon a number of factors. That said, our 2020 revenue guidance contemplates a combined contribution for both vaccines in the range of between $270 million and $300 million of revenue, a return to historic annual levels. Turning to our smallpox franchise, which consist both of the ACAM2000 vaccine and the VIGIV therapeutic, we anticipate strong contributions from both in 2020. Our 2020 revenue guidance contemplates ACAM2000 revenue of between $180 million and $200 million, consisting primarily of shipments to the U.S. government. Recall that in 2019, the U.S. government committed to buy approximately 18 million doses with a value of approximately $170 million as part of the base year contract award. We completed delivery of all doses in 2019 and expect a similar award in 2020. The $180 million to $200 million range for ACAM2000 also includes anticipated sales to international customers. On that note, last year, we signed a multi-year procurement contract with a U.S.-allied nation in support of their continued procurement of ACAM2000. This latest contract win is a good example of the global nature of the medical countermeasure public health threat preparedness business. When we consider partnerships with organizations outside the U.S., we look for international entities that have a similarly aligned goals around preparedness and response, in order to assist them with their readiness capabilities against the threat of various chemical and biologic threats. Next, we expect continued growth in the sales of the NARCAN Nasal Spray business rising to between $285 million and $315 million. This range includes an assumption of two additional states adopting co-prescription legislation, along with branded competition entering the market sometime during 2020. We will continue to focus on three areas. First, expanding awareness of the risks of opioids and the importance of having ready access to naloxone as highlighted by the U.S. Surgeon General's advisory statement. Second, increasing availability and accessibility through a variety of naloxone distribution programs. And third, maintaining affordability of NARCAN. With this focus, we feel confident that NARCAN Nasal Spray will continue to have a meaningful impact on addressing the opioid crisis. While we're on the topic, let me address the 8-K we filed earlier this week. On February 18, we announced that we've reached a settlement agreement in our ongoing litigation with Perrigo related to their ANDA, seeking to market a generic version of NARCAN Nasal Spray. Per the agreement, Perrigo's license will be effective as of January 2033 or earlier under certain circumstances, including the outcome of the current Teva litigation or litigation against future ANDA filers should they come about. This settlement remains subject to customary final approvals. In regarding the Teva litigation matter, also on February 18, we announced that a date for closing arguments has been scheduled by the court for next Wednesday, February 26. Next, let me say a few words about our CDMO services business. We continue to build out our growing portfolio of molecule-to-market contract development and manufacturing services to support both Emergent's growth as well as the growth of external pharma and biotech customers. Factoring in our broad technology platform supporting mammalian, microbial, viral, plasma and advanced therapy approaches, we have reoriented the focus of our CDMO business centering on three strategic pillars. First, commercial, which include sales and marketing penetration, domestic and international expansion and pipeline and portfolio management. Second, operational, where we're striving to harmonize our processes and systems, extend our technological expertise across multiple biologic modalities, as well as expand our capacity and capabilities. And finally, customer centricity with a focus on project management, consistent and focused governance of our relationships with customers in the development of a comprehensive molecule-to-market offering. As you may remember, we announced our decision in 2018 to invest approximately $50 million in expanded capacity and state-of-the-art capabilities at our drug product facility in Baltimore. We anticipate completing this project this year and are already actively engaging in discussions with customers for access to this site's services. We expect to begin generating a positive return on this investment beginning in 2021. Speaking more broadly, we looked for the CDMO business to continue to be a consistent and growing contributor to the overall operations and financial performance of the Company, an integral component of our broad product and solutions offering. Before turning the call over to Rich, let me finish with a couple of brief comments on our key 2020 goals related to R&D. In our devices business, we will continue to invest in and advance our various development pipeline programs for auto injectors in the medical countermeasures market, specifically addressing chemical threats, and in additional naloxone and now within spray and syringe constructs addressing components of the opioid crisis. Of our devices-based development programs, we anticipate one regulatory filing and one approval in 2020. In our therapeutics business, we will continue to invest in the pipeline to address public health threats with our antibody platforms. Regarding FLU-IGIV, our influence A therapeutic for hospitalized patients and leading therapeutic development program, we plan to capitalize in the completion of the Phase 2 and database lock which occurred last year with a data readout in Q2 and then potential Phase 3 initiation later in this year. In our travel health business, Vaxchora, our FDA-approved single-dose oral vaccine for cholera recently received a positive opinion from the EMA, which we anticipate leading to market authorization for the product within a couple of months. If received, it will be valid in all 28 member states of the EU as well as in the European Economic Area countries. And with respect to our chikungunya program, we continue to work toward launching the Phase 3 trial of CHIKV VLP as supported by the compelling Phase 2 data we presented and reported on late last year. While we're on the topic of emerging infectious diseases, I want to make it -- take a moment and speak to the ongoing global crisis related to the coronavirus. As an organization, Emergent is committed to being part of the solution to support pandemic responses, especially where there is an absence of approved preventative and treatment options. The rise of COVID-19 and the push to develop response capabilities against this emerging infectious disease is squarely in our wheelhouse. We have considerable experience, expertise and the infrastructure to bring to bear in helping respond to and solve for this increasingly challenging public health threat. Currently we're working with several organizations, including the U.S. government, NGOs and commercial parties as to how to best marshal our resources and capabilities, whether it's for the vaccine, a therapeutic, diagnostic or utilizing our extensive contract development and manufacturing capability. We'll keep you apprised and posted on progress as events unfold. So to summarize, in 2019, it was another solid year for Emergent operationally as well as financially. 2020 is lining up to be equally successful across all of our business units. The management team and I are committed to achieving our goals and remain confident in our ability to grow organically, while leveraging opportunities to accelerate organic growth through strategic M&A, focus on innovation in the advancement of our pipeline candidates and continually drive great shareholder value over the long term. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rich to provide more detail on the 2019 results and our thoughts about 2020. Rich? Richard S. Lindahl -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As you heard from Bob, 2019 was a year of significant accomplishment for Emergent on multiple fronts as we achieved our operational objectives and set out an ambitious growth strategy for the next five years. From a financial perspective, we exited the year with positive momentum built upon a solid platform for continued growth. Specifically, we delivered strong annual top-line growth, increasing total revenue by approximately 40% for the second consecutive year, of which 7% was organic; improved our blended product and CDMO gross margin by 160 basis points; funded key programs to advance our research and development pipeline; generated strong cash flow from operations; strengthened our balance sheet by increasing liquidity and lowering our ratio of net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA; and provided a 2020 financial outlook that keeps us solidly on track to achieve our long-term strategic growth objectives. For the rest of my prepared comments today, I will provide additional detail on these themes by walk you through our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year periods, discussing balance sheet highlights, and reviewing the elements of our guidance for 2020. With that, let's first look at our fourth quarter performance. As we discussed throughout the year, our 2019 annual results were back-end weighted, consistent with historical trends. As such, our fourth quarter results were particularly strong compared to prior quarters and reflect our ongoing efforts to increase the scale of our operations, while further diversifying our sources of revenue. These points are evidenced by the following key fourth quarter highlights. Total revenues of $360 million, a 33% percent increase versus the prior year, largely due to deliveries of ACAM2000 under our recently awarded contract and a full quarter's worth of sales of NARCAN Nasal Spray, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA of $134 million or 37% of total revenue, a 76% increase versus the prior year. And adjusted net income of $83 million or 23% of total revenue, an increase of $43 million versus the prior year. Digging a little deeper into quarterly revenue NARCAN Nasal Spray sales were $67 million, continuing the strong performance witnessed in the three previous quarters of the year and reflecting the impact of ongoing community access programs addressing the public interest market as well as higher aggregate demand in the retail channel, driven by naloxone co-prescription legislation that is now in effect in nine states. ACAM2000 sales were $79 million as we completed the $170 million of deliveries under the base year performance for the new 10-year contract announced in September. Sales of our anthrax vaccines of $93 million, primarily AV7909, was in line with what we've previewed last month. Other product sales were $73 million, reflecting sales of countermeasure products addressing a wide range of chemical, biological, emerging infectious disease, travel health and emerging health crisis threats. And CDMO services revenue of $26 million, which is down slightly over the prior year. Looking beyond revenue, the quarterly results also include combined product and CDMO gross margin of 61%, reflecting the impact of mix, most notably deliveries of ACAM2000 and anthrax vaccines, as well as continued robust sales of NARCAN Nasal Spray, and operating expenses, both R&D and SG&A, at levels reflecting continuing investments in key pipeline programs and capabilities to support future growth. Turning now to the full year. Our financial performance for 2019 was very strong, and generally consistent with the range we previewed in early January. These results reflect the durability of our expanding business model centered on specialty products and services, targeting global public health threat market opportunities. Key highlights include total revenues of $1.1 billion, an increase of $324 million or 41% as compared to last year, again, of which 7% was organic growth. Total product sales of $904 million, up $297 million or 49%. This includes $280 million from NARCAN Nasal Spray, $243 million from ACAM2000 and other product sales of $208 million, all of which were up meaningfully versus the prior year. Offsetting these increases were anthrax vaccine sales of $173 million, which were lower by $105 million versus 2018. As a reminder, 2019 was a transition year for our anthrax vaccine portfolio as the U.S. government began procuring our next-generation vaccine candidate, AV7909. CDMO services revenue was $80 million, consistent with our expectations for 2019 and lower than the prior year due to contracted service work in 2018 that did not recur. Combined product and CDMO gross margin of 56%, reflecting the impact of mix in our efforts to improve blended gross margin to approximately 60% in the near-to-medium term. Net R&D expense was $92 million or 9% of adjusted revenue, reflecting our ongoing discretionary investments in select development programs that are internally funded, most notably, our CHIKV VLP vaccine program and our FLU-IGIV therapeutic program, among others. SG&A spend of $274 million or 25% of total revenue reflects the addition of the operations associated with the PaxVax and Adapt Pharma acquisitions. As a percentage of total revenue, 2019 SG&A is directly in line with historical norms for the Company. And in terms of full-year profitability, adjusted EBITDA of $280 million or 25% of total revenue and adjusted net income of $152 million or 14% of total revenue, both reflect the influence of product mix, operational execution and cost management balanced with prudent investments and a sustained focus on profitable growth. Three other items I want to touch on are first, the tax rate. For 2019, our effective tax rate is 30%, which is higher than expected due primarily to the non-deductibility of contingent consideration expense related to the Adapt Pharma acquisition. Excluding the impact of this non-deductible expense, our effective tax rate for 2019 was 23%. Second, customer mix. As you will see in the 10-K, which will be filed in the coming days, our customer mix profile continues to become more diversified. For 2019, the mix between U.S. government sales and non-U.S. government sales was 61% and 39%, respectively versus 76% and 24%, respectively in 2018. And third, geographic mix. As will also be disclosed in the 10-K, for 2019, our revenue from ex-U.S. customers as a percent of total revenue was 10% as compared to 9% in 2018. This shows yet another means by which we are diversifying and therefore further strengthening our business. To round things out, in terms of the balance sheet, we ended this year in a solid liquidity position as evidenced by cash of $168 million and an accounts receivable balance of $271 million. Total debt increased slightly year-over-year, and at the same time we meaningfully lowered our leverage ratio of net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA to about 2.3 times, which is at the low end of our target range of 2 times to 3 times. As a result, we further strengthened our credit profile and our current capital structure continues to position us for sustained growth and expansion. Let me turn now to guidance. Taking into consideration the performance from 2019 as well as current facts and circumstances before us, we are reaffirming our forecast for full-year 2020 that we previously published in early January. This consists of the following. Total revenue of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, which reflects the following product specific details. NARCAN Nasal Spray sales of between $285 million and $315 million, anthrax vaccine sales of between $270 million and $300 million, and ACAM2000 sales of between $180 million and $200 million. Returning to our reaffirmed guidance, additional metrics include adjusted net income of $160 million to $210 million and adjusted EBITDA of $300 million to $360 million. In addition, across the year 2020, we look to achieve a variety of additional objectives, namely, the continuation of the following. First, expansion of the CDMO services business and its contribution to the overall business. Second, improvement of gross margin by 200 basis points to 400 basis points, driven by improved product mix and operating efficiencies. Third, investment in discretionary development projects funded by the Company that further our pipeline of potential future drivers of incremental growth. And finally, adherence to a prudent capital deployment philosophy focused on maintaining sufficient capital to both invest in the business as well as execute on attractive M&A opportunities should they arrive. In terms of revenue mix, in 2020, we anticipate that product sales will account for 80% to 85% of total revenue, with the remainder split between CDMO services and contracts and grants revenue. And in terms of the cadence of revenue and earnings, we currently anticipate that 2020 will follow a similar pattern to that seen in 2019. With that in mind, we also are providing guidance on first quarter total revenue of between $190 million and $215 million. This forecast reflects our expectation of no deliveries of ACAM2000 during the first quarter, during -- due to two factors. First, as mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we completed delivery of the full 18 million doses under the base year performance of the recently signed $2 billion 10-year contract. Second, as Bob said, we expect the U.S. government will exercise the first one-year option for another 18 million doses to be delivered in calendar 2020. While we anticipate this option exercise will happen in the near term, our current guidance assumes deliveries of ACAM2000 will resume in the second quarter. That completes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Folkes with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. All right. Thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on a great quarter and year. Firstly, can you elaborate on your assumptions around the market dynamics for NARCAN and the opioid overdose market win and now that branded competitors comes to market, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then maybe, I'm not sure if you're going to answer this, but I'll ask it anyway. At this stage, is the Teva settlement off the table or is this still possible on NARCAN as well? Thank you. Robert G. Kramer Sr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brandon. I didn't understand. Can you repeat the second question? Richard S. Lindahl -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Is settlements still possible, I assume. Robert G. Kramer Sr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer So, thoughts on branded competition. As we described or have talked a couple of times, we fully expect some competition in the market in 2020. We're not going to predict or estimate who might be doing that. Again, our guidance for 2020 is in that $285 million to $315 million range. Two additional Co-Rx states coming in, a branded competitor. So depending on when and if, it's really difficult to predict the impact on the $285 million to $315 million. So, I will not estimate, Brandon. I think on the Teva question, I think we've said openly that -- the settlement question has not come up. We fully -- we have all the confidence in the world and the strength of the patents that we have in place. And our focus remains on those areas that we have been describing for settlement since we bought the brand, which is around awareness, accessibility and affordability, and doing everything we can to make that product available when it needs to be available to the patients and customers who need it. So that remains our core focus. Great. Thanks very much. And one more if I may. Just on the BioThrax work down in 2020 in your guidance, how should we think about that? Are we at a steady state BioThrax sales in 2020 and looking forward into 2021? And AV7909 is going to drive the growth or should we continue to model or workout of BioThrax in 2021 and beyond? Thank you. Robert G. Kramer Sr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks, Brandon. So, I think with the way that we look at the anthrax vaccine franchise is we expect fully that both BioThrax and AV7909 will continue to be procured by the government, obviously, for different reasons. BioThrax is currently supporting both the HHS requirement for a stockpile of license anthrax vaccine, while the Department of Defense is using it to immunize military personnel who are going into high threat areas. We fully expect that that dynamic will continue. As we stated, 2019 kind of began the transition period, Brandon. As the government started to slow down their procurement of BioThrax, while they began to accelerate their procurement of AV7909, we expect that transition to continue in 2020 as we execute against the contracts that are in place. So that's the dynamic. We're not going to speculate on the mix of those two vaccines. But in the aggregate, reinforce our belief that going forward, that number of $270 million to $300 million in total revenue between the two will hold. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple more on NARCAN. For the sales in the fourth quarter, it looks like revenue was down about 11% sequentially and I noticed that the IQVIA script data that we can see is down 7% sequentially. So, recognizing that that data doesn't even fully capture the retail business let alone the public interest side, I'm wondering what led to the sequential revenue decline beyond what would be predicted by the script volume decline. Was that timing of public interest orders or maybe something else? Robert G. Kramer Sr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Jess, thanks for joining and thanks for the question. I think that you're read on that is right. When folks look at that IQVIA data, they're getting a partial view of the overall performance of the business. So, as we stated, we think that there has been a bit of a trend or shift to that public interest market being in that 60% of the market area versus the retail in that 40% space. But, as we've said, this market continues to develop. It's dynamic, it's being influenced by any number of programs where the government, both at the local level as well as the state and federal level, continue to implement programs and get traction on those programs to make this product more accessible to the patients and customers who need it that could be taken in the form of programs like NARCAN -- NARCAN days in different states. So there are any number of programs that are impacting those quarter-over-quarter number. So, I think, folks need to just be a little cautious about looking at a quarter-by-quarter versus on a more macro level. Okay. And next one on NARCAN is just -- has the judge in that litigation with Teva given any indication of how long it might take to turnaround a ruling? Robert G. Kramer Sr. -- President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. And maybe switching to raxi, I realize you have reven",business

Prices for the U.S. and global crude benchmarks, however, posted weekly gains, partly supported by efforts by China to stimulate the economy, which eased some concerns over the virus outbreak's impact on the economy. U.S. government data on Wednesday also revealed a smaller-than-expected weekly rise in domestic crude inventories, along with declines in gasoline and distillate stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery US:CLJ20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 50 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $53.38 a barrel, while April Brent crude UK:BRNJ20 lost 81 cents, or 1.4%, to end at $58.50 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. WTI tallied a 2% weekly rise, based on the front-month contract, while Brent added 2.1% for the week. Saudi Arabia is weighing a break from a production alliance with Russia amid a disagreement between the oil heavyweights over the effect of China's COVID-19 outbreak on global crude demand, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday . The report said Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which make up more than half the production capacity of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, were holding talks to discuss a possible joint output cut of up to 300,000 barrels a day. Read: What a breakdown in the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil alliance would mean to the market A 300,000-bpd cut would only partially compensate for the lost demand as a result of the coronavirus epidemic, Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at IHS Markit, told MarketWatch. The extent and duration of lost demand remains to be seen given that the outbreak has yet to peak and it isn't clear when that might happen. Russia has hesitated to agree to this round of cuts as they await signs of where demand is going, he said. Russia is not part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries but has worked with the group since December 2016 in an effort to balance global oil supply and demand. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, however, told Reuters that the report that the Saudis are considering a break from the alliance is nonsense. OPEC and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are scheduled to hold meetings on March 5-6 in Vienna to discuss production and demand against a backdrop of worries surrounding COVID-19. Prices for oil had climbed on Wednesday, in part due to expectations that the spread of the virus was slowing. The relief about the containment of the COVID-19 virus in China proved to be only short-lived, said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. For one thing, the situation in China is still far from normalizing. And for another, concerns about the virus spreading outside China are increasing, which is putting noticeable pressure on oil prices this morning, Fritsch wrote. The World Health Organization on Friday said there were 76,767 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , with the death toll at 2,247. While the number of new cases world-wide slowed for a second day, analysts said concerns remain over the number of reported infections outside China. The WHI said there were 1,019 new cases world-wide, with 100 in South Korea, which has seen a large uptick in recent days. While the viral outbreak has raised worries over global demand for crude, analysts said positive developments on the supply front, including strife in Libya, renewed pressure on Venezuelan exports could provide underlying support.

The analysts say the illness, which has claimed more than 2,200 lives and sickened 76,767 people, according to the World Health Organization's latest tally, has more room to run depending on the magnitude of the monetary policy response. Gold for April delivery US:GCJ20 on Comex added $28.30, or nearly 1.8%, to settle at $1,648.80 an ounce on Comex. The metal saw a weekly gain of 3.9%, which marked the sharpest weekly rally for a most-active contract since the week ended June 21, according to FactSet data. Read: Gold miner stocks stage broad rally, as gold prices extend run toward 7-year high The powerful rally for the precious metal, which has sparked renewed interest by market analysts, comes as the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.513% slipped 6.4 basis points to 1.9066%, falling below its previous all-time low of 1.95%. Precious metals don't offer a coupon so falling yields can underpin gains for the hard commodity. Gold is now in the fear of missing out, stage, and position traders are chasing gold equities and physical gold, said Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc. Investors have been worried that the disease could hamstring Asian economies, considered linchpins for industries like semiconductors and automobiles, and fuel a global economic slowdown. Data released Friday showed that business in the U.S. contracted in February for the first time in four years due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus and growing angst over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The index covering the large service side of the economy sank 4 points to 49.4, IHS Markit said Friday. However, Federal Reserve members have been sanguine about the outlook for the domestic economy thus far.

It's a Chance to Buy.",https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/prices-for-corn-other-farm-commodities-have-taken-a-dip-its-a-chance-to-buy-51582286976,"The coronavirus has raised concerns over a slowdown in the global economy, but agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cattle are unlikely to suffer, analysts say. There will be no real demand destruction in agriculture from the coronavirus, says Sal Gilbertie, president and chief investment officer at Teucrium Trading. People still need to eat, which means agriculture demand will not abate. The coronavirus lethargy in grain and meat prices could provide investors with a chance to gain access to agricultural commodities prior to any Chinese buying that will occur from the U.S.-China phase-one trade agreement, he says. Related Data Market Data Center: Commodities & Futures Corn futures fell by nearly 2% while wheat gained over 1% and soybeans lost more than 6% this year through Feb. 19. Lean hog prices declined by over 5%, with live cattle futures losing about 4%. Cotton futures, meanwhile, trade 0.8% higher so far this year. The rising coronavirus infection count and death tolls have had a bearish emotional impact on commodity prices that are most sensitive to Chinese demand, including soybeans, says Todd Hultman, lead analyst at commodity market information and analysis provider DTN. Commodities have all reacted differently to the new coronavirus, with haven gold on the rise as oil declines on the back of expectations for lower energy demand. In the agricultural market, lean hogs were hit the hardest by the coronavirus, says Craig Turner, senior commodities broker with Daniels Trading. When phase one of the trade deal went into effect on Jan. 15, we were expecting China to buy large amounts of pork starting on Jan. 25, he says. The coronavirus, however, was gaining steam in the press in late January, and when the market started to worry about the virus, hog prices came down, he says. Turner believes that soybeans, beef, pork, and cotton are the most at risk from the virus in the short term because those are products that China buys from the U.S. Cotton, in particular, is linked to textiles and manufacturing, not food or animal feed. Still, Hultman points out that if and when the disease concerns stabilize, we may actually find that the Chinese government will need to make more food purchases to help cities where quarantines depleted local supplies. In the meantime, there have been concerns that China may not meet its trade deal obligation to purchase $36.5 billion of U.S. agricultural commodities this year and $43.5 billion in 2021, says Dan Cekander, president of grain-market service DC Analysis, adding that he believes the coronavirus has delayed Chinese buying under the trade pact. Cekander expects China to comply with the agreement terms, but if the coronavirus remains headline news until the summer, there is increased risk of China asking for a reduction in its 2020 purchase obligations. Those obligations were already very challenging, says Darwei Kung, head of commodities and portfolio manager at global asset manager DWS Group. With the coronavirus, it is more likely that China would delay the implementation while the government focuses on using its resources to fight the spread of the disease, Kung says. The implementation may only resume post-resolution'' of the epidemic, he says. However, the impact of the virus on food consumption is much less than that on energy consumption, says Kung. While people in China have traveled less or delayed factory reopenings, aggregate food consumption is less likely to be deferred or delayed, he says. Email: editors@barrons.com",business

Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) said it would keep its plants in Xianyang in the central province of Hubei, and Zhengzhou in the neighboring province of Henan, shuttered after Monday, when it had planned to resume operations, but did not set a new date. Honda Motor Co (7267.T) said operations at its plants in Wuhan, Hubei's provincial capital in which the outbreak began, would remain suspended until March 11. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said it would resume production on Monday at its plant in Chengdu in the southwestern province of Sichuan, returning all four of its China assembly plants to operation from next week, but output would be limited at some. In an email, Nissan said its delay was due to a directive by government authorities in Hubei asking firms to keep operations shut through March 10. Output issues at suppliers were also affecting vehicle production, it said. The virus, which has killed more than 2,200 in mainland China, has wreaked havoc on the global automotive supply chain, stalling production at plants there and leaving automakers scrambling to source the roughly 30,000 parts each car needs. Wuhan is a city which produces virtually every type of component used in vehicles, said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. So not only are vehicle assembly plants in the city unable to source parts, vehicle plants all over the world which source parts from Wuhan are being affected. He added that, where possible, automakers were securing parts from suppliers' plants elsewhere. Some automakers were taking more direct approaches to procurement. This week, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said it had flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production, and could run out of components in two weeks. China's manufacturing sector is struggling to restart after an extended Lunar New Year break, hindered by travel and quarantine curbs across the country. The suspension of output at Nissan's two plants, which make the X-Trail SUV crossover and the Altima sedan in a joint venture with China's Dongfeng Motor (0489.HK), comes as the automaker struggles to recover profitability after the arrest of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, in 2018. Nissan has also cut output at some Japan plants over issues with procuring components, but said there had been no impact on  other global plants.

Instead Volok, a 26-year-old Chinese-language student, and  her fellow evacuees found their buses being pelted with projectiles by protesters on Thursday as they approached the sanatorium where they have started a mandatory two-week quarantine. We heard the window smash and everyone fell down into the aisle, she told Reuters by phone. No country has met its citizens like that, she said. We were bombarded, as enemies of the people, and this is very unpleasant. ... We have not done anything wrong to anyone. Despite repeated reassurances from the government that there was no danger, the protesters feared being infected by the virus. Ukraine has no confirmed coronavirus cases and the government says all evacuees were screened before being allowed to board their flight home. The protests have died down and Volok and the others have now settled into the sanatorium, joined by Health Minister Zoriana Skaletska, who will stay there for the duration of their quarantine in an act of solidarity after Thursday's violence. One of the other Ukrainians inside, Aleksandra Volkova, had posted footage on social media of a room inside the facility which had basic furniture, a door that did not lock and a shower which she said gave her an electric shock. But Volok stressed that these were minor problems and that the evacuees were happy and also grateful to the police, some of whom were injured while protecting them from the protesters. The fact that the door does not close is a small problem. We are not here for life, two weeks is not such a long time, she said. Her room has a TV. The inmates have been given a SIM card to make phone calls. They can finally eat Ukrainian food after spending time abroad. Beet salad is a huge delight, Volok said. She had been in China for a year-and-a-half, studying Chinese in Beijing, and had been in Wuhan in the Hubei province on holiday. She spent her last weeks there shut up in her home, waiting to be evacuated, and lived off the food she already had in her house. To pass the time in the sanatorium, she plans to do some exercise inside the room and read books she has downloaded.

As global fears and misconceptions spread about the coronavirus outbreak that originated in the city, protesters blocked roads in the Ukrainian town of Noviy Sanzhari, where 72 evacuees are to be monitored for two weeks at a medical center. Ukraine has no diagnosed cases of the novel coronavirus. The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs said that ""aggressive citizens"" began to pelt the buses with stones, and that one man tried to hit police with a car. ""Those people who today threw stones at the evacuees ... and law enforcement officers, injured nine police officers, one of them has serious injuries, we will make a decision on their punishment,"" Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said. What's spreading faster than coronavirus in the US? Racist assaults and ignorant attacks against Asians Police opened criminal proceedings after the clash, the ministry said. Read More Video circulating on social media appeared to show residents protesting prior to the evacuees' arrival, blocking roads and confronting police. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have sought to ease tensions over the returnees for the last two days. In a show of solidarity, Ukraine's Health Minister Zoriana Skaletska said Thursday that she would spend the 14-day quarantine ""in the same space, the same conditions"" as the evacuees. She said in a Facebook post that her daughter turns 10 today, and apologized for not celebrating it with her. It is unclear whether she has already joined the returnees. Zelensky urged Ukrainians to remember that ""we are all human"" and there was no danger, in a Facebook statement on Thursday. ""Unfortunately, not all of us can be proud of the same human reaction. Attempts to block the roads, block the hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens to Ukraine -- this does not show the best side of our character,"" he wrote. ""The Ukrainian always remains Ukrainian. A temporary stay in Wuhan or emigration to Canada does not make him a stranger to his country,"" he added. The Ukrainian Ministry of Interior said the returnees included 45 Ukrainian citizens and 27 citizens of other countries, including Argentina, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Montenegro, Panama and Israel.

Natt Garun,2/21/2020,theverge,All the ways China's coronavirus outbreak is affecting tech,https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128307/coronavirus-outbreak-tech-industry-production-supply-chain-delay-impact,"The tech sector is currently feeling the impact of the coronavirus, with companies closing offices, stores, and factories in China as well as restricting employees from nonessential travels to the country. The closures, which were initially expected to last through the Lunar New Year holiday week in late January, were soon extended to February 10th. Officials in some provinces and districts are now telling companies not to reopen until March 1st. Multitudes of short- and long-term effects are anticipated, from postponed events to companies potentially missing a holiday launch target due to the nationwide office closures. Here's a look at how the coronavirus has already affected the industry. Related Earlier this month, major tech companies announced they would temporarily shut down all corporate offices, manufacturing factories, and retail stores across China. These companies include Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Tesla, and Google. (Google has also closed offices in nearby Hong Kong and Taiwan.) Most of the closures were expected to last until Sunday, February 9th, though some companies did not specify when exactly the offices would reopen. Apple's head of people, Deirdre O'Brien, wrote in an internal email on February 7th that offices and contact centers were expected to open the week of February 10th, while retail stores' reopenings were still being determined. Additional cleaning, health protocols and local restrictions around public spaces will factor into this decision, she wrote. At the time, it was thought that could have been as late as February 15th for many stores, according to Bloomberg. We're past that date, and Apple is still being cautious about store reopenings; in a rare investor update published on February 17th, Apple said it is gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can. The company did say that its corporate offices and contact centers in China are open. Amazon has not yet announced office closures in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, or Guangzhou (it does not have an office in Wuhan where the virus originated), but it is requiring employees to get approval for any essential travels to China. Employees who are traveling in and out of China are also advised to work from home for a period of 14 days before returning to the office. While Facebook does not have offices in China, it also warned employees against nonessential travels to the country. LG and Razer have also advised similarly. Whether travelers can even get to China is a whole other issue, as more than 50 airlines worldwide have now suspended flights in and out of the country. As many products are manufactured in China (or use parts from Chinese vendors), experts are also warning customers to expect shortages for various smartphones, VR headsets, cars, and other tech accessories. The Foxconn and Pegatron closures in China, for example, are expected to potentially delay iPhones and AirPods production as factory workers are unable to resume work. On Saturday, February 8th, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that China is blocking Foxconn from reopening its Shenzhen plant given the working and living conditions at that factory and that Foxconn had independently decided to keep its Zhengzhou plant closed pending government review. The Zhengzhou factory, aka, iPhone city, is where the bulk of the world's iPhones are assembled. Bloomberg says that Zhengzhou might resume limited production the week of February 10th, but with a small number of workers who didn't travel home for the New Year. Facebook has also stopped taking new orders for its latest Oculus Quest VR headset, citing the outbreak for the delay. [Like] other companies we're expecting some additional impact to our hardware production due to the Coronavirus. We're taking precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, manufacturing partners and customers, and are monitoring the situation closely. We are working to restore availability as soon as possible, the company said in a statement to Android Central. The Quest had been on backorder since around the holiday season; retailers had initially said the headset would be available again in early February, but the date has been pushed back to as late as March 10th for the 64GB version. For fans of the niche gaming ROG Phone II, Asus has also warned customers that the device won't be available again until further notice due to the coronavirus. An open letter to our fans who've been waiting to buy the #ROGPhoneII. Thank you for your patience. #WorshippedByGamers #LovedByTechGurus pic.twitter.com/PgtjaojHOa Due to factory closures, Tesla is also citing the coronavirus for postponed Model 3 deliveries, though the company said it only anticipates a one to one-and-a-half week delay. It planned to resume production at its Shanghai factory on Monday, February 10th. Other Chinese brands that expect to see production delays include Oppo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, and Huawei, according to the South China Morning Post. Companies which rely on components from Hubei will be the most impacted, such as Lenovo, Nicole Peng, mobile analyst at Canalys, said. For companies like Huawei, whose operations are in Guangdong, the situation is less severe, although no company right now will be able to resume factory operations at 100 percent capacity. Similarly, products across the tech sector that were expected to ship in early February have now been delayed due to the virus. These include the Nintendo Switch console, games, and accessories, including the much-adored Animal Crossing edition (that one is specifically delayed in Japan), Ring Fit Adventure, and The Outer Worlds. In its February 17th investor update, Apple also warned that revenue will be lower than expected because of coronavirus' impact on iPhone supply and reduced retail traffic in China. The company did say that its iPhone manufacturing sites have reopened but that they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated. After multiple tech companies either partially or fully pulled out of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference in Barcelona due to coronavirus concerns ” including Sony, Amazon, Nvidia, LG Electronics, ZTE, and Ericsson ” the GSM Association, which organizes MWC, canceled the show. Some game developers are limiting their event travel as well. PlayStation, Oculus, and Facebook Gaming have pulled out of the Game Developers Conference, and Sony also announced it would be skipping Pax East. While the World Health Organization has upgraded the coronavirus' status to a global health emergency, it hasn't necessarily recommended canceling global conferences like MWC. There is no evidence at present to suggest that there is community spread in Europe, so WHO / Europe is not currently requesting that large gatherings are cancelled, a WHO spokesperson said. Huawei, which was expected to host a developer conference in February, has also postponed its event until the end of March. Week two of a major League of Legends tournament has also been indefinitely delayed since January 26th, but the league said it would be hosting online scrimmages starting on February 26th. We want to give a quick thank you everyone for the support when we announced our temporary hiatus for the LPL. We will be hosting an online scrims league starting the 26th. Our primary concern is still keeping everyone safe but we are expecting some great entertaining matches! Similarly, Blizzard has announced that Overwatch League matches in February and March have been canceled, while the FIA has scrapped plans for an upcoming Formula E race that was slated to take place in late March. PUBG's April global qualifier event set in Berlin has also been postponed until further notice.

Credit: Matthew Maran/NPL China's top law-making body is expected to permanently tighten rules on trading wildlife in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which is thought to have originated in a wild-animal market in Wuhan. Scientists speculate that this could include a ban on eating some wild meat. Last month, the national government temporarily suspended the buying and selling of wild-animal products, which are commonly used for food, fur and in traditional medicines in China. But the emergency measure will be lifted once the outbreak ends. Next Monday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet to decide how the trade in wildlife products should be regulated in the long term. The outcome of the meeting will also set the tone for how the government might revise the country's main wildlife-trade law ” which currently only bans the trade of some rare and endangered species ” later this year. The coronavirus outbreak has drawn public attention to the significant health risks posed by eating wild animals. The government has signalled that it wants to take immediate action to prevent any future outbreaks of diseases that spread from animals to humans, says Li Zhang, a conservation biologist at Beijing Normal University. As well as the current outbreak, wild-animal markets are the suspected origin of the coronavirus that caused the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also originated in China. And eating wild meat is thought to have been a source of the Ebola virus in Africa. Conservation scientists speculate that on Monday the committee will ban the eating of wild animals, such as snakes and bats, but say that whether such a ban would extend to farmed wild animals, such as sika deer, is unclear. Researchers don't think that wildlife used for fur and traditional medicines will be affected. Any decision will be legally binding and will come into immediate effect. Some researchers want a total ban on wildlife trade, without exceptions, whereas others say sustainable trade of some animals is possible and beneficial for people who rely on it for their livelihoods. Banning wild meat consumption could cost the Chinese economy 50 billion yuan (US$7.1 billion) and put one million people out of a job, according to estimates from the non-profit Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology in Beijing. Further changes Later this year, law-makers will also meet at the National People's Congress, where they will consider revisions to the country's main wildlife-trade law, the Wildlife Protection Law. The annual Congress meeting, usually held every March to consider new laws, is expected to be postponed on Monday because of the coronavirus outbreak. The Wildlife Protection Law, enacted in 1988 and revised in 2016, prohibits the hunting, killing, selling and purchasing of some 1,800 rare and endangered animals, except with special permissions, says Li. The pangolin, which scientists suspect could be the source of the new coronavirus, is already on this list. But the laws are ambiguous about whether species not on the list can be traded legally, says Li. And the list has not been updated in 30 years, which means that species that have become critically endangered during that time, such as the yellow-breasted bunting ( Emberiza aureola ), are not protected. Any decision on Monday will likely inform more detailed and extensive changes to the law, says Lu Zhi, a conservation biologist at Peking University in Beijing. Lobbying efforts Researchers, conservationists and other special-interest groups have been submitting proposals for Monday's meeting, and these will also be considered in the revisions to the law. Li says the government should unequivocally ban all wildlife trade and consumption because it is a direct threat to wildlife and a major public-health risk. His one exception is for the use of wildlife in scientific research. Wang Fang, a conservation biologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, would like to see a ban on eating all wildlife. He also wants the government to extend the current restrictions on the hunting and poaching of rare and endangered animals to all animals, allowing for some exceptions. Social impact Trading in wild animals is a significant part of people's livelihoods in China, says Xu Ling, director of the China office for TRAFFIC, a wildlife-trade monitoring network, in Beijing. Practices, including eating wild meat, keeping wild animals as pets, and using wildlife products for clothing, should continue to be regulated rather than banned outright, says Xu. A total ban on trading wild animals would criminalize a substantial proportion of the Chinese population, and be untenable, says Zhao-Min Zhou, a wildlife-policy researcher at China West Normal University in Nanchong. And closing down animal markets would probably merely move the trade to the black market, he says. If the government does continue to allow the trade of some species, these will need to be clearly defined, to ensure that enforcement is not arbitrary or discretionary. And more-rigorous inspection of marketplaces and breeding facilities for captive wild animals are also needed, Zhou says.",science

Credit: Getty The outbreak of a new coronavirus is wreaking havoc worldwide. In China, the epicentre of the epidemic, the virus has infected tens of thousands of people and killed more than 2,100. Unprecedented measures meant to contain the spread have brought millions of daily lives to a halt, and the effects have touched economies and global supply chains. Did pangolins spread the China coronavirus to people? The restrictions have also brought unique challenges to scientists. Some have suspended their usual research to study the coronavirus . Others have had their work or personal lives disrupted by lab closures, travel restrictions or problems sourcing equipment and reagents from suppliers in China. In a Nature reader poll, more than 600 of you told us that the coronavirus had affected you, your colleagues and your research. These are some of your stories. People are dying' I was born in Wuhan, China, but I now live in Canada. I learnt about most of what was happening through reading the news, similar to everyone else. It really hit me that these are real, normal, innocent people who are dying when my grandmother started crying as she told me her best friend had passed away after getting COVID-19, within ten days of the first symptoms showing. There were not enough hospital beds, and her son wasn't able to get her admitted in time. The outbreak might have changed my career trajectory. I am currently doing field work in the Bahamas and am trying to answer fundamental questions in ecology and evolution. But one chapter of my PhD thesis involves developing a method to identify endangered animals in steeped alcohol ” such as tiger-bone wine ” a form of traditional Chinese medicine. I am now hoping to expand the scope to incorporate viral metagenomics to look for associations between host animals and viruses in illegally trafficked wildlife products; research has suggested that the new coronavirus could have emerged from a wild animal. I have become interested in human-health aspects of wildlife conservation, and I hope to contribute to this field in my postdoc position by using the molecular-ecology methods I have been trained in to help to prevent future catastrophes related to illegal wildlife trafficking.

I purchased the last available plane ticket to arrive in the United States at exactly 5 p.m. on 2 February. If I had arrived half an hour later, I could have been denied entry to the country, and wouldn't have been able to complete my PhD programme.

Nicholas Jasinski,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Retailers Start Reporting Earnings This Week. What To Watch For.,https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/retailers-start-reporting-earnings-this-week-what-to-watch-for-51582334157,"Photograph by Kamil Krzaczynski/Getty Images Just as reports from big banks tend to kick off each earnings season, a flurry of releases from retailers marks its coming close. Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), Macy's (M), TJX (TJX), and Best Buy (BBY) are some of the merchants set to report fourth-quarter results in the next few weeks. The group's fiscal fourth quarter tends to end in January, encompassing the all-important holiday shopping season. Low unemployment, wages growing faster than inflation, and high consumer confidence helped shoppers feel particularly exuberant in 2019. Overall holiday-period sales were up 3.4% from the year before ”despite six fewer days from Black Friday to Christmas. But beyond that headline number, the winners and losers in the retail sector should be familiar by now. Almost all of the holiday growth came from online shopping, while mall traffic saw yet another year-over-year decline. The crunch for time may have pushed shoppers to turn to the web, rather than taking the extra time to shop in stores, accelerating the shift to Amazon and other online retailers. As relatively high-fixed-cost operations, bricks-and-mortar retailers can see their profit margins tighten and earnings decline at a faster rate than sales when they lose business. Pier 1 Imports (PIRRQ) just filed for bankruptcy. And L Brands (LB) agreed this past week to sell a controlling stake in its flagship Victoria's Secret brand for a fraction of the value it probably would have received a few years ago. Wall Street analysts forecast a 1.6% drop in sales for Macy's January-end fourth quarter”but anticipate its operating income tumbling 26%”from the same period in 2018. The department-store chain recently announced plans to close 125 outlets in 2020, and some value investors have begun to view it as more of a real-estate play than an operating business. That overwhelming pessimism is a short-term contrarian buying opportunity ahead of Macy's report on Tuesday morning, says Daniel Sanders, head of U.S. execution services at brokerage Olivetree Financial. The firm analyzed a variety of fundamental, technical, and other indicators and found that investor sentiment on the stock is in extreme bearish territory. Read more The Trader : Stocks Drop on the Week but Still Look Bubbly. Time to Prepare for a Correction. Macy's has lagged behind the S&P 500 by more than 50 percentage points over the past year. Short interest is high, its dividend yield stands at over 9%, and it trades for under seven times forward earnings estimates. Long-term outlook aside, Macy's might need to only slightly outperform to spur a relatively big post-earnings rise in its shares. In January, Macy's reported that its 2019 holiday same-store sales fell 0.6% ”less than analysts had been expecting. Shares jumped as much as 7% in that day's trading and closed up almost 3%. Sanders notes that Foot Locker (FL) and Wayfair (W) have similarly negative sentiment going into their earnings reports this Friday. Depending on how companies choose to manage expectations, another source of upside could come from retailers' 2020 outlooks, according to Instinet analyst Michael Baker. In a lot of ways, we think this is more important than the actual fourth-quarter results, he wrote in a recent report. Thus, we think the focus will be more on the forward outlooks, and, in that respect, as companies set expectations, historically this is the best time of year to own retail stocks. Baker noted that over the past decade, the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (XRT) has had its strongest two-month performance of the year in February and March. He sees the greatest potential for Best Buy to give optimistic earnings guidance above analysts' current consensus on Thursday, while Home Depot and TJX”on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, respectively”could guide more conservatively than the average estimates. One potential wild card: how companies treat the impact of coronavirus in China . Warnings from otherwise well-positioned brands like Nike (NKE) that rely on the country for sales or production could overshadow potentially strong holiday-quarter results.

PA Media,2/21/2020,theguardian,NHS to test Londoners for coronavirus at home,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/nhs-to-test-londoners-for-coronavirus-at-home,"The NHS has started testing people for coronavirus in their own homes in London. The new approach will be expanded to other areas outside the capital in the coming weeks. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Prof Keith Willett, the NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus, said: We have started to pilot home testing for coronavirus in London, which will be carried out by NHS staff, like nurses or paramedics, allowing people to stay home rather than having to travel, which is safer for you and your family and limits the spread of infection. Anyone who is concerned they have signs and symptoms should continue to use NHS 111 as their first point of contact. They will tell you exactly what you need to do and, where necessary, the right place to be tested. People should also play their part by following public health advice: wash your hands, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, and put used tissues in the bin immediately. I would also like to thank the NHS staff who are back in Arrowe Park [hospital] ready to provide excellent care and support to the British nationals who are returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Dozens of Britons who have spent more than two weeks on the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship off the Japanese coast are preparing to return home this weekend. Late on Friday night GMT, the Foreign Office tweeted: We can confirm the evacuation flight from Japan has now departed with 32 British and European passengers on board, as well as British government and medical staff. It is due to arrive in the UK on Saturday morning. The passengers are due to land at the Boscombe Down Ministry of Defence base, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Only those without symptoms will be allowed to board the plane, and all the passengers will be taken to Arrowe Park in Wirral for 14 days of quarantine.",general
"Parija Kavilanz, CNN Business",2/21/2020,cnn,Bridal gowns will be in short supply for wedding season because of coronavirus,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/business/wedding-gowns-coronavirus/index.html," With the summer wedding season around the corner, the coronavirus outbreak could leave brides-to-be in panic: Some may be unable to get the wedding gown they want for their big day. China is a leading supplier of wedding gowns. As much as 80% of the world's western-style gowns are produced there, according to the American Bridal and Prom Industry Association. Many factories in China have remained closed this year as the country attempts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Bridal gown sellers are concerned about supply shortages because of China's coronavirus outbreak. Although China's vast manufacturing engine is slowly coming back on line, the extended shutdown has resulted in a production delay across the board for all kinds of products, including wedding gowns. ""We have spent a lot of time monitoring the situation in China and I believe a lot of disruption is going to happen,"" said James Marcum, CEO of David's Bridal, the largest seller of wedding gowns in the United States. ""It's not only with bridal gowns but there's the bridesmaid side of things, too."" Producing a wedding gown requires significant time and a highly skilled workforce. Many dresses are customized to the bride, with intricate details, such as hand stitching and beadwork, some of which takes as much as 100 hours of work by hand, Marcum noted. Read More So unexpected production delays slow down an already time-consuming process. The domino effect could leave wedding gowns sellers unable to deliver their customers' orders on time. ""We're already hearing that some wholesalers are informing their buyers about shipment delays because of the virus,"" said Marcum. ""We don't have full visibility as yet to the extent of those delays."" At least a month delay In response to the slowdown, retailers are stocking up on wedding dresses and prom gowns, said Stephen Lang, owner of Mon Cheri Bridals, based in Trenton, New Jersey. The company is a large-scale producer of special occasion dresses, including wedding gowns, and supplies them to over 10,000 stores worldwide, including 4,000 stores in the United States. Eighty percent of its wedding gowns are made in China. LOL Surprise toys could be in short supply this holiday season because of coronavirus ""My orders are up 11% for the year already,"" said Lang, who is also president of the American Bridal and Prom Industry Association which represents manufacturers and retailers. ""They are loading up because everyone is really worried about a shortage in the summer,"" said Lang. ""There's already at least a month delay in the supply chain [from China]. It will get worse if everything isn't back to normal soon."" David's Bridal is the largest seller of bridal gowns in the United States. Lang is closely watching a run on his existing inventory that's been sitting in warehouses. ""That's going to run out at some point and I need to restock it quickly at some point,"" he said. The problem is that even though factories are starting back up -- over half of Mon Cheri Bridal's factories are now open --  Lang explained that dress production could still be stalled because of shutdowns further up the production process. Mills that make the fabric and fabric centers that supply the material aren't up and running yet, Lang said. Still, he's hopeful brides aren't left scrambling. ""Look, no one should have to go without a wedding dress,"" said Lang. ""If this China situation extends beyond summer, then yes, [dress] choices will start to get limited."" Marcum said all of David's Bridal factories in China are now open. China accounts for less than half of the brand's wedding gowns production. The retailer also produces its gowns in Sri Lanka, Burma and in Vietnam. And Marcum said David's Bridal currently has enough inventory set aside in its warehouses and in its 300 stores nationwide. ""We can be nimble while we monitor the situation in China,"" said Marcum. ""We feel confident, but if the situation arises, we will do anything, even airfreight gowns to make sure our customers have them.""",general

The tractor maker and bellwether for agriculture said the ""US farm sector shows early signs of stabilization."" Net income rose 4% even though revenue was down 6%. Deere's sales have been battered in the past year due to trade tensions between the United States and China, with China launching several retaliatory tariffs aimed directly at agricultural products in America's heartland, such as soybeans and pork.

"Pavel Polityuk, Natalia Zinets",2/21/2020,reuters,"After clashes, Ukraine blames disinformation campaign for spreading coronavirus panic",https://www.reuters.com/article/china-health-ukraine/after-clashes-ukraine-blames-disinformation-campaign-for-spreading-coronavirus-panic-idUSL8N2AL335," - Ukraine's Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk on Friday blamed an information war being waged on the country for spreading panic and mistrust over the coronavirus, a day after the arrival of  evacuees from China sparked clashes outside a sanatorium. Speaking to parliament, Honcharuk said misinformation was being spread from within and outside Ukraine but did not elaborate. The authorities are trying to find the source of bogus emails sent this week on behalf of the health ministry erroneously declaring there had been confirmed coronavirus cases in Ukraine, when so far there have been none. In another example, Honcharuk cited an incident of Russian officials asking a wagon-load of passengers travelling on a train from Kiev to Moscow to disembark after a Chinese woman with fever was found to be travelling on board. The Ukrainian railway service said it has asked Russia for more information on the case. Police detained 24 people in clashes with residents of a town in central Ukraine on Thursday, who feared they would be infected by Ukrainians who had been evacuated from China's Hubei province to a sanatorium for a mandatory two week quarantine. The events that took place yesterday, in my opinion, are a consequence of, in particular, the information war that continues against our country, both from inside and out, Honcharuk said.

Everyone inside the sanatorium was feeling well and showed no signs of infection, she said. So, I'm finally in a room where I'll spend the next two weeks, she wrote. Skaletska decided to join those in quarantine after people in the town of Novi Sanzhary, where the sanatorium is located,  clashed with police, burned tires and hurled projectiles at a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from China. Despite reassurances from the authorities, the protesters worried they could be infected by the virus and wanted the evacuees moved away. Skaletska said she was amazed by what she described as the panic and aggression towards the evacuees, and hoped her setting a personal example would change minds. Speaking to parliament, Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk said misinformation about the coronavirus was being spread from within and outside Ukraine. The authorities are trying to find the source of bogus emails sent on behalf of the health ministry erroneously declaring there had been confirmed coronavirus cases in Ukraine, when so far there have been none. In another example, Honcharuk cited an incident of Russian officials asking a wagon-load of passengers travelling on a train from Kiev to Moscow to disembark after a Chinese woman with fever was found to be travelling on board. Ukraine's health ministry said the woman had not been infected with the coronavirus. Police detained 24 people in Thursday's clashes.

Peter Apps,2/21/2020,reuters,COLUMN-Fears over coronavirus threaten globalisation rule book: Peter Apps,https://www.reuters.com/article/apps-golobalisation/column-fears-over-coronavirus-threaten-globalisation-rule-book-peter-apps-idUSL8N2AL2G5," By Peter Apps LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - As the Ebola virus ravaged West Africa in 2014, civilian air traffic in and out of the most affected countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia almost completely ceased. That decision, however, was not taken by international health officials. Instead, it came from airline cleaners and other staff, who simply refused to have anything to do with planes in and out of the region. In many respects, the 2013-16 West African Ebola outbreak, believed to have caused around 11,000 deaths from 28,000 cases, was very different to the current coronavirus epidemic. The diseases are different - Ebola killed roughly one in four of those it infected. So are the areas affected, and their connections to the outside world. The forests and cities of West Africa were much less central to the world economy than China, where the outbreak is already seen having a significant impact on global growth. As with Ebola, however, the world is already responding by attempting to completely isolate the affected areas, regardless of whether or not that is something the science yet deems necessary. Much of that is down to outright fear, with alarming signs that it might sometimes be deliberately exacerbated to stoke tensions and alarm. In Ukraine this week, dozens of protesters attacked buses carrying evacuees from China as they were bought to a hospital in the town of Novi Sanzhary, where they were to be held in quarantine for 14 days. Ukraine's security services said a fake email claiming to be from the health ministry said some evacuees had already contracted the virus, something they said was simply not true. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on protesters to show empathy, reminding them the evacuees were human beings. One of the things most striking about the epidemic so far, however, has been how fast countries have been willing to rip up what would often be deemed basic human rights in their wish to control its spread. To what extent this is been truly justified may never really be known “ although if worldwide spread can be limited it will almost certainly be seen justified. That would likely make it the model for any future crises. China has repeatedly changed the way in which it categorises and counts cases, but says the number so far exceeds 75,000 with 2,200 deaths. Ironically, that relatively low fatality rate “ around 3% - is one of the characteristics that makes containing the virus so difficult. Many of those infected have relatively mild symptoms, some may not report it at all. Still, that still brings with it the risk of a global pandemic that could kill several million “ leaving governments unusually open to doing whatever they believe is necessary to stop it. In China itself, where millions have now often found themselves quarantined at once, kept either in their houses or makeshift rapidly constructed camps and hospitals, the government has had no qualms in showcasing just how draconian it can be. Given the nature of China's government, particularly in the last few years, that's hardly a surprise. But Western states such as Britain and Australia, however, have also been taking often unprecedented steps to ensure those who have travelled in affected regions are kept away from others. As with the 2015 Ebola-outbreak “ as well as other epidemics of much-feared disease “ one aspect that is particularly striking is the speed with which countries and companies are willing to lock down economic and business activity in the hope of halting a wider pandemic. Bookings with airlines show passengers avoiding huge swathes of Asia well outside affected parts of China, while the most affected Hubei province now has almost no public or private transport travelling to it at all. Insiders say that after a high-profile outbreak aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, cruise firms are dramatically scaling back operations in Asia. The Diamond Princess has been the scene of one of the largest outbreaks outside China “ and another ship, the Westerdam, was denied permission to dock in five countries despite having not a single proven case. Such worries are hardly new “ the word quarantine comes from the 40-day waiting period mediaeval Italian ports would impose on visiting ships during times of plague to prove they were uninfected. What that means in the modern era of just-in-time supply chains and mass population movement, however, has yet to be truly tested. Events in Ukraine suggest it may already be exacerbating existing frustrations and unease over the implications of a mobile, interconnected, multinational world. In the absence of scientific data and surveillance, firms and countries appear increasingly prone to profiling by nationality. Some cruise ships have begun refusing to board individuals with Chinese or Hong Kong passports “ while in Hong Kong, worries about the disease crossing from the mainland have become yet another source of political division following months of protest against Beijing last year. Where that ends is by no means clear. Pockets of disease in South Korea and Japan suggest that for all the efforts in mainland China, international spread may yet be inevitable. What that brings with it politically, culturally and economically we do not yet know. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

Revenue also exceeded forecasts. Deere said it sees signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector, and that the relaxation of trade tensions is improving farmer confidence. Coca-Cola (KO) “ The beverage giant said the coronavirus outbreak would cut its current-quarter earnings by a penny to 2 cents per share, but adds that it still expects to achieve its prior full-year earnings targets. T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S) “ The mobile operators announced amended terms of their merger which will reduce the stake of Sprint shareholder SoftBank, while T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom will have a slightly higher stake. Chewy (CHWY) “ The pet products seller was upgraded to ""outperform"" from ""sector perform"" at RBC Capital, on what the firm calls a ""highly favorable"" risk-reward outlook. RBC said Chewy has strong sustainable fundamentals, including upbeat revenue growth and expanding profit margins. Dropbox (DBX) “ Dropbox reported quarterly earnings of 16 cents per share, beating consensus by 2 cents a share. The online file storage company beat revenue estimates as well. Dropbox also raised its profit margin outlook and announced a $600 million share buyback program. First Solar (FSLR) “ First Solar earned an adjusted $2.02 per share for the fourth quarter, short of the $2.72 per share profit that Wall Street analysts had anticipated. The solar power company's revenue also came in below estimates and First Solar gave weaker-than-expected revenue guidance. Wells Fargo (WFC) “ The bank is close to settlements with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice over probes into its sales practices, according to The New York Times. The paper said the settlements could be announced as soon as today. HP Inc. (HPQ) “ HP adopted a so-called ""poison pill"" to help fend off Xerox's (XRX) attempt to buy the computer and printer maker. The poison pill gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if any one entity acquires 20% of outstanding shares, diluting the group's stake. Fitbit (FIT) “ Fitbit posted an unexpected loss of an adjusted 12 cents per share, compared to predictions of a 3 cents per share profit. The maker of wearable fitness devices also saw its revenue come in below forecasts, as it sold more devices but at lower prices. Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) “ Texas Roadhouse beat estimates by 9 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of 61 cents per share. The restaurant chain's revenue beat forecasts as well with same-restaurant sales up 4.4%. Texas Roadhouse also announced a 20% dividend increase. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) “ Sprouts earned 27 cents per share for the fourth quarter, nearly doubling the 14 cents a share consensus estimates. The organic grocery chain's revenue was slightly above forecasts, and the company gave a better-than-expected full-year earnings outlook. Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) “ Pilgrim's Pride fell 10 cents a share short of estimates, with quarterly profit of 14 cents a share. The poultry producer's revenue came in above Wall Street forecasts.

Rajesh Kumar Singh,2/21/2020,reuters,Deere's shares hit all-time high on unexpected rise in quarterly profit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deere-results/deeres-shares-hit-all-time-high-on-unexpected-rise-in-quarterly-profit-idUSKBN20F1MN,"Deere & Co's (DE.N) shares hit an all-time high on Friday after the company reported an unexpected increase in first-quarter profit, but the world's largest farm equipment maker warned the outbreak of coronavirus would hit sales and earnings in the second quarter. Shares surged 9.7% to their highest-ever level of $181.99 in morning trade after Deere said it sees signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector, which has been buffeted by a nearly two-year-long trade war with China. Shares were up 8% at $179.16 in mid-afternoon. A lower tax rate lifted the quarterly profit to $1.63 per share from $1.54 per share last year, topping Refinitiv's average analyst estimate of $1.26 per share. The trade war hit American agricultural exports to China, a major buyer of soybeans, leaving farmers struggling to turn a profit and hurting purchases of new farm machinery. The Moline, Illinois-based company said an early order program for its combines ended this year with a low single-digit  growth in the United States. It described the tractor order book for this year as healthy. Farmer sentiment began to show early signs of stabilization during the quarter as uncertainty surrounding market access abated, Brent Norwood, Deere's investor communications manager, told analysts on an earnings call, referring to the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade agreement. The company, however, warned the outbreak of coronavirus will impact its next sales and profits report. The outbreak forced Deere to close all eight of its  facilities in China and is also threatening to affect its factories in the United States by limiting supplies of several components that formerly came from China. Deere said limited production has restarted at some of its Chinese facilities. It projects spending $40 million in the second quarter on expedited freight and is working with suppliers and logistics providers to alleviate the supply issues. Illinois-based Morton Industries, which supplies to Deere, Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) and Komatsu Ltd (6301.T), said customers are helping it to procure the impacted components domestically, but the prices of local vendors are higher. There is a lot of effort going on right now to minimize the impact, said Kevin Baughman, Morton's vice president of operations. We do not anticipate any supply disruptions with our efforts. The epidemic has also cast doubts on whether China can boost U.S. farm purchases by the dollar amount agreed to in the interim deal. A little over a month since the U.S.-China trade deal, which mandates a sharp jump in U.S. agricultural exports this year, farm commodity prices remain depressed as Chinese purchases have been way below the pre-trade war levels. Norwood expects farmers to remain cautious until farm exports to China begin to flow. Sales at Deere's farm and turf business, which accounts for nearly 60% of its revenue, declined in the latest quarter, but higher price realization along with lower production costs and warranty expenses resulted in higher operating profit. The company retained its 2020 profit forecast of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Matthew Lewis",business

""The Scarlet Lady is truly special and we've worked with some of the world's most sought-after designers, artists and architects to craft an extraordinary experience,"" Branson said as he presented the ship to the media on Friday. But the launch comes as another liner ” the Diamond Princess ” reaches the end of a 14-day quarantine amid the coronavirus outbreak. A total of 624 confirmed cases of the virus have been linked to the ship during its isolation in Tokyo Bay, with 79 new cases confirmed on Wednesday.

Read More Having tested the waters of just about every other travel business over the course of his lengthy career, fixing his name to trains, planes and spaceships after initially launching Virgin as a record store, the entrepreneur says the launch of the ship marks the realization of a long-held ambition. ""I have dreamed of starting my own cruise line since I was in my 20s and I'm thrilled that moment has arrived,"" he said. Branson's pursuit of young vacationers has yielded features not found on many other cruise ships: There's a stripey drinking spot called Razzle Dazzle, a Korean eatery called Geonbae and a tattoo and body piercing parlor dubbed Squid Ink. The ship also features 78 luxury RockStar Suites. Those include 15 Mega RockStar Suites, which are further divided into Massive, Fab, Posh and Gorgeous Suites. Prices for those come in at around $19,000 per cabin, while the cheapest cabins start from around $1,600 for three- and four-day tours.

In 2019, 30 million passengers were expected to cruise , up from 17.8 million a decade earlier, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. That rapid growth brings its own problems, however. Congestion at ports around the world has sparked complaints from locals, and the environmental impact of high-polluting ships is coming under renewed scrutiny ” particularly among the younger travelers Branson is hoping to attract. Branson touts 'a voyage like no other' Branson is taking to the seas with a healthy tailwind behind him; shares of his Virgin Galactic venture have skyrocketed nearly 200% since the company went public last October, boosted by optimism about the company's plans to launch a commercial space service. Forbes, in its most recent annual list of the world's billionaires, estimated Branson's net worth at $4.1 billion. The Scarlet Lady is the first of three planned ships from Virgin Voyages, the cruising arm of Branson's empire, which he set up in late 2014. Two more are due for delivery in 2021 and 2022. The vessel weighs 60,000 tons, according to the Virgin Voyages website. According to the ship's builder, Fincantieri, it stretches 278 meters long and 38 meters wide. With 1,430 cabins, it will carry more than 2,770 passengers and 1,160 crew. The designers behind the suites say they called on Virgin's rock and roll heritage, with rooms featuring nods to icons including Grace Jones, and sailors can expect a retro-futurism vibe throughout the ship's accommodation. Scarlet Lady: Cruise like a rock star aboard Virgin Voyages' first ship For customers with especially deep pockets, the Massive Suite will feature a music room stocked with guitars, an amp and a special private lookout point at the front of the ship. It's also got a private terrace with a standing hot tub, a large ""runway"" table for entertaining guests and an open-air ""Peek-a-View"" shower that offers sea views. And all suite guests will have access to Richard's Rooftop, an ""exclusive chic outdoor lounge."" Branson is hoping to mitigate environmental concerns by banning single-use plastics aboard the ship.

On Thursday, six buses carrying 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals were brought to a hospital in Novi Sanzhary, a town southeast of the capital city of Kyiv. Dozens of protesters sought to block the route of the buses, hurling stones at the convoy while engaging in violent clashes with the police. The vehicles were eventually able to reach their destination after a tense stand-off, albeit hours later than scheduled. All of the evacuees will spend the next two weeks in quarantine. The country's health minister has said that none of the passengers on board the buses were thought to be unwell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for calm, urging citizens to show empathy to the evacuees. ""I sympathize with our evacuees, because I already know what it is to be under personal protection, and in them the protection will be much more serious than that of the President,"" Zelenskiy said in a statement posted on Facebook on Thursday. ""But there is another danger that I would like to say. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainian. Each of us. Including those who ended up in Wuhan during the epidemic."" The chaos came shortly after a disputed email purporting to be from Ukraine's health ministry was sent on the same day evacuees arrived from Wuhan, China, ” the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The email had spread false information that five people in the country had contracted the deadly flu-like virus. Ukraine has no confirmed cases of the coronavirus inside the country. Only two Ukrainian nationals aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan were reported to have contracted the virus, and both have since recovered. The Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement published Thursday that the email, which was distributed to the health ministry's entire contact list, originated from outside Ukraine. China's National Health Commission reported Friday that 75,465 cases of the coronavirus had been confirmed, with 2,236 deaths nationwide. In an effort to show solidarity to the evacuees, Ukraine's health minister has said she will join those in quarantine. ""With them, I will spend the next 14 days in the same room in the same conditions. I hope that my presence will reassure both those who are in New Sanjar and the rest of the country,"" Zoryana Skaletska, Ukrainian health minister, said in a Facebook post on Thursday.",finance
"Samuel Shen, Brenda Goh",2/21/2020,reuters,China firms in $10 billion share sale rush as funding rules eased amid virus worries,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-companies-newissue/china-firms-in-10-billion-share-sale-rush-as-funding-rules-eased-amid-virus-worries-idUSKBN20F15Y,"Listed Chinese companies are queuing up to issue shares and have already announced plans to raise more than $10 billion in the past week after fundraising rules were relaxed to help ease cash strains caused by the coronavirus. More than 50 companies, including Bank of Ningbo (002142.SZ) and battery maker Yinghe Technology (300457.SZ), have published as of Thursday fresh or revised plans to raise as much as 73 billion yuan ($10.4 billion) through private placements, according to Reuters calculations. The new rules allow companies to sell shares worth up to 30% of their share capital via private placements compared with 20% previously. The number of investors allowed to participate in such placements was lifted to 35 from 10. The changes also make the deals more attractive to investors by halving the lock-up periods and enabling more flexible pricing. The rush to market comes as China has been pumping liquidity into the financial system, cutting interest rates as well as easing other funding avenues, in a bid to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 people and stalled many business activities. The share sales will also be helped by a resurgent stock market. The blue-chip CSI300 .CSI300 has rebounded roughly 13% from a low hit on February 3 when traders returned after the new year break, compared with 3.8% for the U.S. S&P 500 .SNP benchmark over the same period. China cut its benchmark lending rate on Thursday, helping lift the tech-heavy ChiNext index .CHINEXTP to the highest level in almost three years. Investors are encouraged by monetary easing, and are looking beyond the epidemic, said Wu Kan, a portfolio manager at Soochow Securities Co. China needs a booming stock market to help channel funding to the real economy. Relaxation of the rules comes as a relief to many companies. More than 75% of respondents in a survey of over 140 companies by Sealand Securities, said the epidemic was straining their liquidity, with smaller firms saying they will burn through their available cash within three months unless the situation normalizes. Some companies badly hit by the virus reported an 80% slump in revenue. But the relaxed standards represent a reversal of China's stance since officials sharply tightened share placement rules following the 2015-16 market crash, where reckless fundraising was seen as a contributing factor. Xu Chao, analyst at the Pacific Securities, said the rule changes represented a very strong loosening signal from the authorities. Private placements raised just 122.9 billion yuan last year from a peak of 1 trillion yuan in 2016, according to Kaiyuan Securities, which expects fundraising via this route to at least double in 2020 from 2019. The easier access to funds could increase the risk of moral hazard, some analysts have warned. It's a double-edged sword, said Fan Lei, economist at Sealand Securities, who said the moves implied regulators were becoming more tolerant toward market speculation, often dubbed stir frying. A bit of stir-frying helps attract money into the market, Fan said. Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman",business
Sarah Wu,2/21/2020,reuters,"Coronavirus widens Hong Kong anger at government, China",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-hongkong-protests-insigh/coronavirus-widens-hong-kong-anger-at-government-china-idUSKBN20F0E3,"Pro-democracy protesters have all but vanished from the streets of Hong Kong over the past month as residents avoid the new coronavirus, but the outbreak has broadened discontent with the city's leadership and China's influence on the financial hub. Some business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians have joined pro-democracy and union figures in attacking Carrie Lam's administration for what they see as an uncoordinated response to the virus and its refusal to seal the border with mainland China, which might have prevented infections. Regardless of political opinions, people in Hong Kong have already lost confidence in the government of Carrie Lam, said Mike Lam, chief executive of the AbouThai department store chain. Lam's stores have experienced some of the chaos caused by the virus, recently receiving almost 100,000 applications for only 3,400 boxes of surgical masks in stock, said Lam. Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents have largely ignored the government's attempts to calm the situation, panic-buying food staples and toilet paper in supermarkets and forming long queues for masks and hand sanitizer in the rare places they can be found. That has led to widespread anger and will fuel renewed protests this summer, activists say. Now, it is not really about politics, it's about your genuine life, said Clement Chung, chairman of the Hong Kong Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industries Employees General Union, which has recruited 320 members since it formed on Dec. 31. It connects all the people in Hong Kong in terms of anti-government sentiment. The disappointment and the anger, they want something to change, he said. Lam's refusal to completely shut the border with mainland China - largely seen as a move to appease Beijing - has inflamed many in Hong Kong. Four current and former leaders of the territory's Liberal Party, which is generally in favor of business, the government and China, criticized Lam on the issue. As the new coronavirus wreaks havoc on the mainland, the only right decision you should make is to immediately close the border, they wrote to Lam this month, calling her response hesitant and ineffective. Three-quarters of the city's residents agree, according to a survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute released earlier this month. The same proportion of 156 U.S. business leaders polled by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong also said they want the border closed. In the first week of February, 8,000 doctors, nurses and medical workers in the newly formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) took part in a five-day strike, chanting: Close the border, save Hong Kong. Hours after the strike began, Lam announced the closure of four more border crossings to mainland China, but stopped short of a total shutdown. Now 10 of 13 checkpoints are closed. That may not be enough to stop frustration spilling over this summer. The anger that is building up will fuel future protests against the government and for democracy, said Lee Cheuk-yan, a labor activist and former pro-democracy politician. Lee said the next marches will likely start around July 1, the 23rd anniversary of Britain handing back control of Hong Kong to China, or earlier if the virus subsides. Hong Kong was roiled by often violent protests throughout the second half of last year, following an attempt by the government to introduce a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. The bill was withdrawn but the protests escalated into a broader call for greater democratic rights in the city and an inquiry into alleged police brutality in dealing with the protests. ANTI-CHINA MOOD The virus, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected 75,465 people and killed 2,236 in mainland China, according to the country's National Health Commission. Hong Kong has reported 68 infections and two deaths. Lam rejected a complete shutdown of the border as discriminatory and impractical. Her administration said its decisions were based on World Health Organization guidelines, and not politically motivated. The only consideration of the government in dealing with the infection is public health, and the government's actions are underpinned by very strong scientific and expert advice, Lam's office said in a statement to Reuters. Lam has also pledged HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion) to measures to counter the spread of the virus and ease the financial impact on businesses. Not all in Hong Kong are critical. Sunny Ho, executive director of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, said he was happy with Lam's measures and that critics had grossly underestimated the difficulties that the administration has to consider. That understanding is not visible at street level, where many remember the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 that also started in mainland China and killed nearly 300 people in Hong Kong. Some reactions have crossed into hostility toward residents and visitors from the mainland. A list circulating on social media shows 34 restaurants that refuse to serve customers from areas they deem to be high risk for coronavirus. Posters outside some restaurants entrances ban mainlanders, citing health concerns. Edgy Salon said on Facebook it would only cut Hong Kongers' hair, while Kwong Wing Catering posted: You won't seal the border, so I'm sealing my shop. One popular post on a pro-democracy Facebook page bragged of misleading mainland Chinese tourists into buying sexual lubricant instead of scarce hand sanitizer. Hundreds rallied in at least three Hong Kong neighborhoods last weekend to protest against plans to turn some government-owned public housing into coronavirus quarantine centers, angry about lack of consultation with citizens. In January, a group of protesters set alight the lobby of one of the buildings. Some of the 40 or so pro-democracy unions formed since late 2019 have led a more organized approach to the outbreak, and plan to use that momentum to put more pressure on the city's government. HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu, who organized the medical workers' strike, called labor unions a new battlefront for our protest. Chung said he hopes others unions will take the relay baton to continue the strike, although most of the new unions need more members to force change. They broke the stereotype that Hong Kong people cannot strike, said Alex Tsui, chairman of the new, 450-strong Hong Kong Hotel Employees Union, referring to the HAEA walkout.

Sebastian Kettley,2/21/2020,express,Lyme disease treatment: Japanese knotweed offers hope of Lyme disease cure,https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1245686/Lyme-disease-treatment-Japanese-knotweed-antibiotics-symptoms-Lyme-disease-cure," Up to one in five Lyme disease patients do not respond to antibiotics, stressing the need for alternative treatment. The tick induced illness, which can trigger exhaustion and joint pain, affects as many as 3,000 people in the UK each year. But a new study into the effects of Japanese knotweed suggests reprieve could be on the horizon. A paper published by researchers at the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found between 10 and 20 percent of patients still experience symptoms after treatment. Lyme disease is also notoriously hard to diagnose because initial symptoms are often vague and confused for other illnesses. But there is hope plant-based drugs could phase out the standard course of antibiotics administered over a two to four-week period. READ MORE: Lyme disease symptoms: A certain feeling in head could be a sign   Researchers at Johns Hopkins university studied 14 plant-based extracts and compared their effectiveness against doxycycline and cefuroxime, two antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease. Of the 14 planets, Japanese knotweed and Ghanaian quinine were found to be the most effective. Some of the other plants that outperformed the antibiotics include black walnut, cat's claw, sweet wormwood, Mediterranean rockrose and Chinese skullcap. The plants were found to be effective against B. burgdorferi, the tick-carried bacteria responsible for Lyme disease. Dr Ying Zhang from John Hopkins said: This study provides the first convincing evidence that some of the herbs used by patients such as Cryptolepis, black walnut, sweet wormwood, cat's claw, and Japanese knotweed have potent activity against Lyme disease bacteria, especially the dormant persister forms, which are not killed by the current Lyme antibiotics. These findings are exciting as they offer opportunities for improved treatment of persistent Lyme disease, which is not helped by the current standard treatment.  These findings are exciting as they offer opportunities for improved treatment of persistent Lyme disease Dr Ying Zhang, John Hopkins John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health We are interested in further evaluating these potent herbal medicines through animal studies as well as clinical trials. The findings were published on February 21 in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. Japanese knotweed is already used in traditional medicine in India and China due to it containing polyphenol resveratrol. Japanese knotweed was also found to have anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory effects on the heart and nervous system. DON'T MISSDid Nostradamus predict the deadly coronavirus? [INSIGHT]Coronavirus LIVE tracker: See the spread of coronavirus here [MAP]Six problems that can occur if you have too much vitamin B6 [ANALYSIS]   Ghanaian quinine is a shrub found across West Africa that is known for its antimicrobial properties. The shrub is used in treating malaria, hepatitis, septicemia, and tuberculosis. According to the new study, both plants were found to kill micro colonies B. burgdorferi even at low concentrations. The study also found a seven-day treatment with a one percent concentration of Ghanaian quinine could wipe out the bacteria. Dr Sunjya from California Center for Functional Medicine said: Many thousands of Lyme patients today, especially those with later-stage symptoms who have not been effectively treated, are in great need of efficacious, accessible treatment options. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be spread to humans by infected ticks. Many people infected by Lyme disease typically develop a rash where they were bitten by the tick, although the rash can appear up to three months after the bite, making diagnoses tricky. The NHS said: If your GP thinks you might have Lyme disease, they'll prescribe a course of antibiotics. See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",general
Seema Mody@SeemaCNBCPatrick Manning@PatrickDManning,2/21/2020,cnbc,Coronavirus: DuPont ramps up safety suit production amid China shortage,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-dupont-ramps-up-safety-suit-production-amid-china-shortage.html,"Thousands of DuPont employees are working around the clock to increase production of protective garments that are in high demand by first responders and medical workers in high-impact regions like Wuhan, China. The protective suits are used by health professionals during the outbreaks to reduce the risk of infection. Reports from China show workers running low on safety supplies including garments and masks. The COVID-19 coronavirus has killed at least 2,249 people and sickened more than 76,700 worldwide. The majority of the cases and deaths are in China. Officials there have looked to contain the spread of highly contagious disease by closing schools and businesses for weeks. But for health workers on the frontlines, protective gear is crucial. At DuPont's largest manufacturing facility in Richmond, Virginia, CNBC got an inside look at how the company is making changes to its operations to accommodate the rise in demand. ""It's been really intense for us to build up production and make up a lot of products for the coronavirus, specifically,"" said Stephanie Bernheisel, product engineer at DuPont. Of the protective suits DuPont makes, the most popular is the white Tyvek suit, which costs anywhere between $5 to $15. The suit is thin and protects the body from many fluids, but does not cover the hands, feet or face. But it also makes heavy duty Hazmat suits that act as a shell around the entire body, and are often worn with an oxygen tank. Those suits can cost in many cases more than $1,000. At the 500-acre factory in Richmond, heat and pressure are applied to the polyethylene fabric, it's then flattened and rolled. The fabric is then sent to one of nine manufacturing facilities around the world where the final suit is made. As DuPont's Chinese factories return to full capacity, the company's executive said it's increasingly relying on operations in Vietnam. ""Vietnam is a large manufacturing base for us, our manufacturing in China today is largely for the China domestic need. So we've ramped that up inside China, and also in Vietnam,"" said David Domnisch, DuPont personal protection global business director. DuPont said following the Ebola outbreak, the company expanded its supply chain operations to allow the company to remain nimble and meet customer needs during times of need. ""Every time there's an outbreak like this we try to learn from it. After the 2015 Ebola outbreak, we invested heavily in providing additional agility into our supply chain,"" said Domnisch. On average, DuPont makes 200 million protective garments a year. But, this year is shaping up to be anything but average. RBC Capital said any increase in suit production could be meaningful to earnings but the disruption DuPont has seen in China could offset that.",finance

The International Air Transport Authority (IATA) warned on Thursday that the virus' impact on demand could cost airlines more than $29 billion, with Asian carriers bearing the brunt of the losses. The outbreak will also likely reduce global traffic by 4.7%, wiping out IATA's earlier forecast for growth and marking the first overall decline in demand since the global financial crisis of 2008 - 2009. The coronavirus has killed more than 2,200 people worldwide, with all but 11 of those deaths in mainland China. The total number of infected worldwide stands at over 76,000. These airlines have suspended flights to and from China In response, dozens of airlines have canceled or reduced services to mainland China. Beijing has also placed more than 780 million people under travel restrictions in an effort to contain the virus, and suspended all domestic and international tour packages. IATA's forecast assumes that the outbreak remains mostly in China. Read More ""If it spreads more widely to Asia-Pacific markets then impacts on airlines from other regions would be larger,"" the authority said. Airlines have already started to feel the pain. Qantas Airlines ( QABSY ) said on Thursday that the virus could carve up to $100 million of pre-tax profit from the second half of the company's fiscal year. Air France-KLM ( AFLYY ) also said on Thursday that the virus could slash its earnings by as much as $216 million between February and April.",general
Simon F. Haeder,2/21/2020,theconversation,What the Trump budget says about the administration's health priorities,https://www.theconversation.com/what-the-trump-budget-says-about-the-administrations-health-priorities-131624,"The Trump administration recently released its budget blueprint for the 2021 fiscal year, the first steps in the complex budgetary process.  The final budget will reflect the input of Congress, including the Democratic House of Representatives, and will look significantly different.  However, budget drafts by presidential administrations are not meaningless pages of paper. They are important policy documents highlighting goals, priorities and visions for the future of the country. As a health policy expert, I find the vision brought forward by the Trump administration deeply concerning. Cuts to virtually all important health-related programs bode ill for nations future. To make things worse, ancillary programs that are crucial for good health are also on the chopping block. To be sure, most of the proposed damage will find it hard to pass muster with Congress. Yet given the nation's ever-growing debt Congress may soon be amenable to rolling back the nation's health safety net. To no one's surprise, some of the biggest cuts in the proposed budget focus on health care programs. The budget document uses a number of terms to disguise its true intentions. Yet a closer look indicates that terms like rightsizing government, advancing the President's health reform vision, modernizing Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and reforming welfare programs all come down to the same end result: cuts to the safety net. One of the main targets remains the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. In 2017, after several failed attempts to repeal and replace the ACA, the Trump administration has scaled back its open hostility. Instead of asking directly to repeal the ACA, this year's budget proposal calls for initiatives to advance the president's health reform vision, by cutting more than half a trillion dollars from the budget. These initiatives come on top of actions the Trump administration has already taken to roll back the Affordable Care Act, including the repeal of the individual mandate penalty, severely limiting outreach and enrollment efforts, and creating a parallel insurance market by expanding the roles of short-term, limited duration and association health plans.  The Trump administration has also targeted Medicaid, the nation's largest safety net program serving mostly low-income Americans, pregnant women, children, the disabled and those in need of long-term care, as well as its cousin, the Children's Health Insurance Program. Overall modernization for these two programs alone would entail cuts of almost US$200 billion. Medicare, the program serving America's seniors, technically would not undergo significant restructuring. However, streamlining and eliminating waste would reduce the program by more than half a trillion dollars or 6%. 
All put together, cuts to the ACA, Medicaid and Medicare will exceed a trillion dollars over a decade. Coverage losses, mostly affecting lower-income Americans, would range in the millions of dollars.  In the U.S,, we often equate health with access to medical care. However, researchers have long recognized that medical care contributes only about 10% to 20% to the health of individuals. One crucial component of good health is access to education. However, the Trump budget includes cuts of more than $300 billion across the entire education spectrum from Head Start to grants that support college education. Access to food and nutrition also plays a major role in maintaining good health. However, two programs providing important food security to millions of Americans would face significant cuts. For one, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which supplements food budgets for 34 million Americans with an annual budget of $58 billion, is slated for $22 billion in cuts over a decade. There are also cuts exceeding $2 billion over a decade to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which reaches more than 6 million Americans with an annual budget of $6.4 billion.  Cuts to nutritional benefits would be further compounded by a 15.2% reduction to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department provides a range of housing assistance programs to needy individuals. Moreover, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program which provides cash benefits to needy families, faces 10% in cuts. A healthy environment and access to clean air and water unquestionably are crucial to living a healthy life. However, the proposed budget would trim spending on the agency tasked with protecting the nation's environment, the Environmental Protection Agency, by more than 40%, or $36 billion.  A myriad of public health crises have been slowly but steadily harming communities all across the country. Much of the attention has been garnered by the devastating opioid crisis. More recently, the coronavirus and the seasonal flu epidemic have caught the headlines. Yet, there are countless other epidemics harming communities around the country including syphilis, hepatitis C and gonorrhea. Yet the nation's major public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control, would see its budget decline by 9%. The Trump administration is also proposing to significantly reduce funding for health-related research programs. One target is the National Science Foundation, which would see a reduction by 6.5%. Moreover, the National Institutes of Health, the nation's premier medical research agency, is set for 7.2% in cuts. Both agencies play crucial roles in positioning the nation to tackle current and future health challenges.  Since the Kennedy administration, taxes have generally been cut and only rarely increased. Particularly large tax cuts under the George W. Bush administration, without commensurate budget cuts, have created a systemic imbalance in the federal budget. This imbalance was further exacerbated by the recent tax cuts under the Trump administration. So far, we have been able to stall the eventual reckoning because of strong economic growth and our ability to borrow heavily. Eventually, it seems inevitable that this massive imbalance will catch up with us. Faced with the choice to either raise taxes or cut programs, Congress may choose the latter. With defense spending largely untouchable, health programs and other social support systems will likely bear the brunt.  [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]",business

Sunny Oh,2/21/2020,marketwatch,Here's three reasons why the 30-year Treasury yield plunged to a record low,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-three-reasons-why-the-30-year-treasury-yield-plunged-to-a-record-low-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline,"The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield dropped to an all-time low on Friday, sparking worries among investors who wonder what it's saying about the economy's future prospects. Analysts say the slump in the long bond's yield this week reflects a confluence of factors including easy Federal Reserve monetary policy, concerns about the COVID-19 epidemic's impact on economic growth, and an absence of inflationary pressures. Historically, a slump in long-term yields can indicate fears that growth will start to disappoint and inflation will fall which may make the real return on bonds more attractive. On Friday the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 1.462% fell 5.2 basis points to 1.92%  based on Tradeweb data to an all-time low of 1.89%.  The 10-year note yield also tumbled below the key level of 1.50%, last trading at 1.475%. Here's a few reasons why the bond-market made history on Friday. Coronavirus worries Heading into Friday investors were already on the watch for signs of the economy succumbing to the coronavirus epidemic amid fears that it would disrupt global supply chains and weigh on growth estimates for China which now has the second largest economy in the world. See : COVID-19 tally: 76,767 cases, 2,247 deaths, 100 new cases in South Korea So when IHS Markit released its weaker-than-expected U.S. February manufacturing and service sector purchasing managers surveys , the data sent panic among investors who received one of the first confirmations that the coronavirus impact could be more painful than thought. With the exception of the U.S. government-shutdown of 2013, US business activity contracted for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis in February, according to IHS Markit's flash PMI data. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the Composite PMI Output Index (covering both manufacturing and services) slumped to 49.6 in February, down from 53.3 in the opening month of 2020. Weakness was primarily seen in the service sector, where the first drop in activity for four years was reported, but manufacturing production also ground almost to a halt due to a near-stalling of orders. Compared with official data, statistical analysis indicates that the survey indices are consistent with GDP growth slowing from just above 2% in January to a crawl of just 0.6% in February, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.83% index and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.43% deepened  their losses following the PMI report as both benchmarks retreated from their respective record closes set earlier this week. Read : Tech stocks lead Wall Street slide as coronavirus worries rise As concerns around the coronavirus epidemic heat up, traders may also be looking to avoid holding short positions on long-dated Treasurys before the weekend, when further bad news on the coronavirus spread may be forthcoming. It's hard to imagine any scenario where we get an all clear' on the COVID-19 front by Monday. But things can certainly get much worse in the next 60 hours. That asymmetry means its very hard to go into the weekend short safe haven assets, said Jon Hill, an interest-rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets. Central bank policy Investors also turned to one of the usual suspects for the decline in long-term rates ” easy central bank policy. Though, members of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee like Vice Chairman Richard Clarida say the central bank is unlikely to lower interest rates given the positive economic outlook and tight labor market, traders are betting otherwise. The fed fund futures market is pricing in more than 40 basis points worth of cuts by the end of the year. There's a lot of liquidity in the market, and we should expect even more stimulus from central banks, said Marcelo Assalin, head of emerging markets debt at William Blair, in an interview. He added expectations for stimulus from the U.S. had not only driven income-hungry investors into government bonds but also into the highest-yielding corners of fixed-income markets such as emerging markets. Inflation expectations Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research sees the steady decline in inflation expectations as a key support for the rally in the 30-year bond also. The 5-year, 5-year forward inflation expectation rate, which measures the expected inflation rate (on average) over the five-year period that begins five years from today, fell to 1.63% on Wednesday. As economic growth worries take a toll on prices for industrial commodities and crude oil, forecasts for consumer prices to make a steady return to 2% have disappeared. Fed officials have struggled to understand why inflation continues to shoot below their target even as unemployment rates have fallen and monetary policy has remained loose. This persistent shortfall has led some researchers to suggest that inflation expectations are unanchored, and that the central bank's efforts to meet its inflation objective was losing credibility, said Nathan Sheets, chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income.",business

Nobody has come since the outbreak. Few sectors have escaped the impact of the epidemic, which has brought China's economy to a standstill. But the blow to some industries has been cushioned by an ability to continue business online. A pedestrian and cyclist pass Lunar New Year dΓ©cor and shuttered bars in a retail district in Beijing last week. Associated Press Within China's property market, a number of popular apps offer everything you'd need to find and buy a house ” search functions with easy-to-use selection criteria such as location, price and unit type; realistic virtual-tour experiences; the ability to chat with agents and sellers; a section showing how hot properties are with real-time updates on how many people have viewed units; and even mortgage services. Industry insiders were hopeful the rich digital experience would translate into at least some online sales. Buying a home is obviously a much bigger commitment than purchasing a microwave from Amazon AMZN, +0.87% , but Tesla TSLA, -0.51% has proven that customers are willing to plunk down sizable sums for items with which they may have no firsthand experience. In the property sector, it hasn't worked, said Lianjia agent Xiao Jiang. They need to see the units. Xiao did hear of one exception ” with a colleague at a different Lianjia branch in the city closing a sale without the buyer ever seeing the property in person. But word is that the buyer is rich and this is just a second or third property as an investment, Xiao said. Newly released data show just how deep sales declines have been. New-home prices rose at their slowest pace in two years in January, due in large part to the standstill at the end of the month as the severity of the epidemic became apparent. Prices for new homes inched up 0.27% from December to January in 70 big cities, China's National Bureau of Statistics said. Sales of new and existing homes plummeted 90% from the same period of 2019, according to a survey by China Merchants Securities. A survey by Huatai Securities put that number closer to 98%. February data are expected to be worse, as numerous cities have been put under lockdown, showrooms for many agencies were ordered closed, and potential buyers have been either unable or unwilling to view properties. As with other sectors of China's slowing economy, the hit to the property market comes as the industry was already experiencing pain. In an attempt to reduce a property bubble and rein in speculation, the government last year implemented measures to cool the market by restricting multiple-home purchases and tightening mortgage access. Regardless, analysts believe the property sector is one that will experience a quick and near-full rebound once the virus outbreak is contained. If that containment happens relatively soon, the blow to the industry will be fleeting, since the outbreak has merely postponed demand in the market, demand that will return, Guangzhou-based GF Securities 000776, +0.81% 1776, -0.48% said in a report released earlier this month. Meanwhile, developers are rolling out incentives to lure buyers. China's leading property developer, Evergrande Group, is offering its largest price cut ever, said Liu Xuefei, vice president of sales. This includes 25% off housing purchases until the end of the month, when the discount will decrease slightly, to 22%, for the duration of March, Liu said. Several industry titans, including Sunac China Holdings 1918, +0.45% , Sinic Holdings 2103, -1.20% and Country Garden 2007, -0.40% CTRYY, +3.08% , have begun allowing customers to cancel purchases within 30 days of the contract being signed, hoping the risk-free incentive will attract new buyers. Agent Xiao said he predicts business will return to some semblance of normal in the coming weeks, as sales branches reopen and prospective buyers are able to resume viewing units. The apps are a great tool to get people in the door, he said. But it's got to be a real door and a real apartment they can walk through for any buying to take place. Tanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron's and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.",business
Thomas Franck@tomwfranck,2/21/2020,cnbc,Larry Kudlow: Falling bond yields don't reflect US economy's fundamentals,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/larry-kudlow-says-falling-bond-yields-dont-reflect-the-us-economys-fundamentals.html,"Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, told CNBC on Friday that he believes the recent decline in U.S. bond yields doesn't reflect market fundamentals but instead a transient flight to safer assets in the wake of the coronavirus in Asia. Asked by CNBC's David Faber how he interprets a new, all-time low on the 30-year Treasury bond, Kudlow said he has to think it's ""a run to safety."" ""I just think, in general, I would be very careful to put too much emphasis on what bond rates are doing, what interest rates are doing. Or even in the short, short run, the stock market,"" he said. ""I think you have a lot of mood swings here and I don't think it reflects the fundamentals."" Kudlow's comments came as the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to an all-time low under 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 285 points, slightly less than 1%. Though traders widely blamed the coronavirus for Friday's risk-off pivot, some suggested the record low on the 30-year bond represents a longer-term view that economic growth could be slowing and that the Federal Reserve may not be equipped to remedy a slowdown. ""The fixed income market, usually the world's greatest pessimist, tends to look way out in the future when pricing the current market,"" wrote Raymond James rates strategist Kevin Giddis. ""It is looking far ahead to the negative effects that the virus could have on the U.S. economy, which could force the Fed in, kicking and screaming."" But Kudlow countered that the stock market's strong gains over the last 12 months are a sign of ""business and consumer confidence"" and that corporate conditions could remain healthy throughout 2020. ""In the three years under policies of lower tax rates, deregulation, independent energy and better trade deals to open up an export boom, we have managed a 2.5% growth rate on average,"" he said. ""That is significantly better than the prior administration. It is also significantly better than what the CBO has forecasted."" ""America is working and there is a blue-collar boom,"" he said. ""This a fundamentally very sound economy."" Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.",finance
Tomi Kilgore,2/21/2020,marketwatch,SolarEdge's stock jumps to a record after company clears a high bar with another revenue beat,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/solaredges-stock-jumps-to-a-record-after-company-clears-a-high-bar-with-another-revenue-beat-2020-02-20,"Shares of SolarEdge Technologies Inc. ran up toward another record Thursday, after the solar products maker extended its streak of revenue beats and provided an upbeat outlook, citing very strong growth in the U.S. Chief Executive Zvi Lando also helped assuage concerns over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China, given the company's manufacturing footprint there, by saying on the post-earnings conference call with analysts that he did not expect any disruption to revenue in the first or second quarters, given the pre-outbreak actions taken to meet growing demand. The stock SEDG, +3.30% soared 11.3% to close at a record $142.20 on volume of 6.5 million shares. The full-day average volume over the past 30 sessions has been 1.1 million shares, according to FactSet. The Israel-based company's results and outlook managed to clear a high bar set by Wall Street, after the stock soared 17.9% on Wednesday to a record close of $127.82 in anticipation of strong results. The stock had run up 34.4% year-to-date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.89% had gained 4.8%. SolarEdgeΒ reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter net income of $52.8 million,or $1.03 a share, compared with $12.9 million, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. That missed the average analyst estimate of $1.05 a share, according to FactSet. That marked the fifth straight quarter that the company missed EPS expectations. Excluding nonrecurring items, such as one-time operating expenses and stock-based compensation, adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.65 from 63 cents a year ago. Revenue increased 59% to $418.2 million, above the FactSet consensus of $413.8 million. The company has beat revenue expectations for 18 straight quarters, starting with the first quarterly report as a public company in May 2015. The company said it expects first-quarter revenue of $425 million to $440 million, which is above the FactSet consensus as of the end of January of $388.9 million. On the conference call with analysts, CEO Lando said the reason the company has been able to manage the effects of the coronavirus outbreak was because it had already taken actions before the outbreak in anticipation of increased product demand this year, and given the usual manufacturing slowdowns in China during the Lunar New Year holiday. Actions taken included building up inventory and shipping it to distribution centers in the fourth quarter, and securing an agreement with its contract manufacturer (CM), Jabil Inc. JBL, +4.02% , to keep manufacturing during the holiday at a reduced rate. As a result, when the Chinese New Year vacation was extended due to the coronavirus, the manufacturing lines at our CM in China continued to operate and manufacture products, Lando said, according to a FactSet transcript. These two measures, combined with increased capacity in our factories in Hungary and in Vietnam enables us to continue to meet capacity needs of our customers despite the unfortunate circumstances that developed. He said on the call that all SolarEdge and Jabil employees at the factory in China are healthy and most have returned to work. Kudos to Cascend Securities Chief Investment Strategist Eric Ross, who raised his stock price target for SolarEdge to $140 from $120 on Wednesday, in anticipation of strong results . He followed that up on Thursday by raising his price target again, to $160. SolarEdge delivers!, Ross wrote in a note to clients. A week earlier, on Feb. 12, JPMorgan's Mark Strouse had raised his price target to $129 from $112, citing potential upside to earnings estimates. On Thursday, he raised his target further to $141. Despite the recent stock gains, Strouse said he believes current valuation multiples undervalues one of the few solar stocks that is consistently profitable, generates cash and has a solid balance sheet. CFRA's Angelo Zino raised his price target to $140 from $78, saying he sees a healthy residential/commercial market through 2021 and that he remains optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the company's recent investment in areas such as electric vehicles.",business

The ""Mad Money"" host checked in with Domino's Pizza CEO Ritch Allison after the chain reported a domineering fourth-quarter amid a tight delivery market. Later in the show Cramer broke down why investors may want to buy the dip in Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Investors were spooked by a pickup in coronavirus cases in South Korea and triggered a sell-off on the stock market, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 128 points, the S&P 500 declined 0.38% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.67% during the trading day, though the major averages were down even more earlier in the session. ""Breathers like this one can extend the life of a rally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But without good news on the virus, I'm pretty certain that we'll have more breathers down the pike, so be prepared."" Carryout has become a bright spot for Domino's Pizza as the restaurant chain battles in a tough, low-margin food delivery environment, CEO Ritch Allison told Cramer. Shares of the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based pizza franchise popped almost 26% during the trading day on a strong fourth-quarter report that smashed Wall Street estimates. ""While most of the industry is running headlong into delivery, which is inherently a more profitable channel to serve, we're working hard to hold serve on that delivery side of the business while really growing that carryout channel,"" Allison said in a ""Mad Money"" interview. Carryout ""is going to be an important part of the profit equation going forward."" The market gave investors an opportunity to buy position in Vertex Pharmaceuticals as drug stocks traded lower the day after the Nevada Democratic debate, Cramer said. ""Vertex Pharma got dinged today, and I think this is a very buyable dip in what's widely considered to be the hottest biotech story of the year,"" the host said, adding the company ""accomplished something that was unthinkable not too long ago, a near-triumph over the scourge that is cystic fibrosis.""

For the latest updates, visit the live blog from CNBC's Asia-Pacific team. All times below are in Eastern time. Thousands of DuPont employees are working around the clock to increase production of protective garments that are in high demand by first responders and medical workers in high-impact regions like Wuhan, China. The protective suits are used by health professionals during the outbreaks to reduce the risk of infection. Reports from China show workers running low on safety supplies including garments and masks. ”Mody and Manning Online travel booking company Trip.com is pushing back its fourth-quarter earnings report from Feb. 26 to March 18 to tally the impact of the outbreak on its ticketing and tour business, the company said. ""The revised date would give the company more time to observe business conditions and provide visibility for the first quarter of 2020,"" the company said. ”Kopecki The coronavirus outbreak ruined for investors what was a solid earnings reporting season and is casting a pall on forecasts for this quarter and the rest of this year. And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month. Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline. However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. ”Li Airlines have canceled more than 200,000 flights as the coronavirus continues to spread to new countries, prompting travel restrictions and a sharp drop in demand for trips to and within China. Between Jan. 23 and Feb. 18, 99,254 scheduled flights didn't fly, close to 90% of them domestic trips, aviation consulting firm Cirium said. That's sending jet-fuel prices, generally airlines' second-biggest expense after labor, down sharply. While benchmark jet-fuel prices in the U.S. and Singapore have recovered some ground from hitting the lowest levels since mid-2017, they're each down 17% so far this year, according to data from S&P Global Platts. ”Josephs California, Nebraska and Illinois are the only U.S. states that can currently test for coronavirus, the Association of Public Health Laboratories told Reuters. The CDC last week said some of the testing kits sent to U.S. states and at least 30 countries produced ""inconclusive"" results due to a flawed component, and the CDC planned to send replacement materials to make the kits work. The CDC has increased testing capacity until new testing kits become available, said Scott Becker, the executive director of APHL, which represents public health laboratories in the United States. ”Reuters An outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy worsened, with officials announcing 14 confirmed cases in the wealthy region of Lombardy, while two cases were reported in the adjacent region of Veneto. Just hours after revealing that six people had come down with the virus in the first known cases of local transmission in Italy, officials said a further eight had tested positive for the disease, including five health workers. Separately, ANSA news agency said two people had been diagnosed as suffering from the highly contagious illness in Veneto, although it was not immediately clear if the cases were connected. ”Reuters U.S. health officials are preparing for the COVID-19 coronavirus to become a pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. ""We're not seeing community spread here in the United States, yet, but it's very possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on a conference call. ""Our goal continues to be to slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread."" Messonnier pointed to China where schools and businesses have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same. ""The day may come where we may need to implement such measures in this country,"" she said. ” Lovelace, Feuer Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, has begun testing individuals at local social welfare institutions, the municipal government said in an online statement. The investigation is a response to a Chinese citizens' complaints on social media that 11 elderly people died from fever and respiratory failure since the quarantine for the new coronavirus began on Jan. 21. Wuhan's Civil Affairs Bureau reported that at a welfare institute for more than 600 elderly people, there were 12 cases “ one worker and 11 among the elderly, including one death. Data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has found the sick and elderly most at risk. ” Wu World health officials said the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in Iran, where there are 18 confirmed cases and four deaths in just two days, is ""very worrisome."" Earlier in the day, Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases. Seven people found to have contracted the flu-like virus were diagnosed in Qom, four people in Tehran and two in Gilan. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said a 45-year-old woman in Lebanon has been linked to the outbreak in Iran. ""The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although the numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome,"" he said. ""These dots are actually very concerning."" ” Lovelace While Chinese authorities try to control the spread of the new virus, they are moving quickly to stall its impact on the economy, especially on people's jobs. This past Tuesday, the powerful State Council decided at a meeting to waive some business' contributions to social insurance plans through June, and emphasized that ""stable employment"" must be a priority. These policy moves also come as the country begins a gradual return to work in manufacturing, technology and other major industries. The coronavirus forced more than half of the country to shut down for at least a week longer than planned for Lunar New Year's celebrations. About a third of 1,000 Chinese companies surveyed in the last week by research firm China Beige Book remain closed, and roughly another third are operating remotely. ” Cheng The coronavirus has spread to several Iranian cities, a Health Ministry official said Friday, as an outbreak that the authorities say began in the city of Qom caused two more deaths. Iran confirmed 13 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total in the country to 18, with four of the total having died. The majority of coronavirus cases in Iran have been in Qom, a Shiite Muslim holy city 75 miles south of the capital Tehran. The new cases comprised seven people diagnosed in Qom, four in the capital Tehran and two in Gilan province, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a tweet. Health officials had called for the suspension of all religious gatherings in Qom. ""It's clear that new coronavirus has circulated in the country and probably the source of this illness was Chinese workers who work in the city of Qom and had traveled to China,"" Health Ministry official Minou Mohrez said, according to the official IRNA news agency. ” Reuters World Health Organization officials are holding a news conference at 10 a.m. ET Friday to update the public on the outbreak. WHO officials declared the virus a global health emergency last month, while urging the public against overreacting to the virus. However, the COVID-19 epidemic in China has not yet met world health officials' designation of a global pandemic that spreads far and wide throughout the world. While it has spread to more than two dozen countries, international health officials say there's little transmission on local levels outside of China right now. They have warned that could quickly change. Watch the live news conference here. ” Feuer Organizers of the Mobile World Congress pulled the plug on the show ” and the 100,000 visitors it normally draws ” less than two weeks before it was set to start Monday in Barcelona, Spain, marking a turning point for companies in the global battle against a new virus that's killed more than 2,100 in China over the last seven weeks. Since the disease, named COVID-19, emerged from the city of Wuhan in late December, U.S. airlines have cut service to much of China and Hong Kong and dozens of trade exhibitions and conferences have been canceled or postponed. Major corporations have pulled their executives from attending conferences across the globe, including major trade shows in the U.S., as fears of a possible pandemic spread of the virus gripped the world meeting market. ” Miller The first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Lebanon on Friday after a woman arriving from Iran tested positive, a source at a Beirut hospital where the woman is being quarantined told Reuters. There were no further details immediately available on the case. Lebanon's health minister was expected to hold a news conference on Friday to address the case. ” Reuters Markets that are expecting an interest rate cut are reacting to the coronavirus scare and likely will reverse once the fear starts to fade, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said. In an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Bullard pushed back on the likelihood of a cut, saying current policy seems right considering the pace of the record-breaking U.S. economic expansion. ""There's a high probability that the coronavirus will blow over as other viruses have, be a temporary shock and everything will come back. But there's a low probability that this could get much worse,"" he said. ""Markets have to price that in, and that drags down the center of gravity a little bit. But if this all goes away, I expect that pricing will come back out of the market and we'll be back to the on-hold scenario."" ” Cox Iran's Health Ministry on Friday reportedly confirmed the coronavirus had spread to several cities nationwide, before adding the flu-like virus might exist in all of them. ""Based on existing reports, the spread of the coronavirus started in Qom and with attention to people's travels has now reached several cities in the country, including Tehran, Babol, Arak, Isfahan, Rasht, and other cities. And it is possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,"" Health Ministry official Minou Mohrez said Friday, Reuters reported, citing the country's official IRNA news agency. It comes after the Islamic Republic confirmed 18 total cases on Friday, and four patients have died. ” Meredith Coca-Cola is forecasting that the coronavirus will drag down its first-quarter earnings by a penny to 2 cents a share. The company also estimates that the outbreak will hit unit case volume by 2% to 3% and organic revenue by 1% to 2%.The beverage giant is still expecting to meet its full-year outlook. Coke's Chinese business accounts for about 10% of its global volume but less of its profit and revenue. ” Lucas Israel's Ministry of Health on Friday confirmed a passenger returning from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan has tested positive for COVID-19. The patient is in quarantine and under supervision, the Health Ministry said in a statement, adding the infection did not take place in Israel. The remaining passengers returning to Israel were reported to have tested negative for the coronavirus. ” Meredith Iran has confirmed two deaths among 13 new cases of the coronavirus, according to a statement from Health Ministry spokesperson Kinaush Jahanpur. Seven people found to have contracted the flu-like virus were diagnosed in Qom, four people in Tehran and two in Gilan, Jahanpur said Friday. The total number of confirmed cases in Iran has now climbed to 18, with four deaths. ” Meredith A coronavirus patient who was discharged less than two weeks ago has tested positive for the virus, Chengdu Public Health and Medical Center said Friday in an online statement. The post said the patient was discharged on Feb. 10 after meeting requirements from China's virus diagnosis protocol, and went home for a 14-day quarantine. The hospital said it received the patient on Wednesday for further treatment. Chengdu is the capital city of Sichuan province in southwestern China and located more than 1,100 kilometers (683 miles) away from Wuhan. ” Wu Following several days of back-and-forth over how Hubei defines virus cases, an official for the province's health commission said confirmed infections cannot be removed from the province's official count, state news agency Xinhua reported Friday, citing a news conference. Cases that have been removed must all be added back, the official said, according to the report. The official cited a stringent demand from the province's party secretary, Ying Yong, a former Shanghai mayor who assumed the position last week. On Thursday, the Hubei Provincial Health Committee reported there were 349 new cases as of Feb. 19 ” down from 1,693 newly confirmed cases the day before. The commission stated that 349 was the final tally after deducting 279 cases from 10 Hubei cities. ” Cheng Read CNBC's coverage from CNBC's Asia-Pacific and Europe teams overnight here: Outbreak in Chinese prisons, South Korea cases exceed 200 Reuters and CNBC's Yun Li, Hannah Miller, Jeff Cox, Amelia Lucas, Sam Meredith, Evelyn Cheng, Lilian Wu, Seema Mody and Patrick Manning contributed to this report.",finance

This could be any regular day at the Shanghai Ballet Company - one of China's top troupes, founded in 1979 - except that everyone in the room is wearing a mask due to the coronavirus. The dancers returned this week after the Lunar New Year break, which had been extended because of the outbreak, and some are finding it hard to train while breathing through a mask. It's the first time in my life that I've trained with a mask on, lead dancer Wu Husheng said. I think I need to improve my physical strength because after a few motions, I found it difficult to breathe. Wu, 33, says he can normally train for an hour at a time, but he feels breathless in just 20 minutes with the mask on. Shanghai, like much of China, is urging people to stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 2,200 and infected over 75,000 on the mainland. But head of the Shanghai Ballet, Xin Lili, says that a fortnight of self-quarantine imposed by city authorities may have already left the dancers behind schedule for their April performances - if those are allowed to go ahead. The ballet troupe has also been depleted as some dancers have been unable to return from their hometowns amid strict travel curbs aimed at containing the coronavirus epidemic. We need to start training, Xin said. We cannot lie at home for a long time. Of course, safety is a top priority. We have a big red blanket at the entrance to the building, and I ask for it to be sterilized every two or three hours. The ensemble, like other sectors of China's economy, has been hit hard by the epidemic. At least 30 of its performances have been postponed, including some scheduled for Australia and Hong Kong. I do worry about the health of the dancers sometimes, Xin continued. But we are taking precautions such as ensuring the temperature in their apartment block is kept high enough so that they don't catch a cold. Reporting by Xihao Jiang and Martin Pollard; Writing by Karishma Singh; Editing by Himani Sarkar",business
"Yasemin Saplakoglu,LiveScience",2/21/2020,scientificamerican,"Researchers Map Structure of Coronavirus ""Spike"" Protein",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/researchers-map-structure-of-coronavirus-spike-protein/,"Researchers worldwide are racing to develop potential vaccines and drugs to fight the new coronavirus, called SARS-Cov-2. Β Now, a group of researchers has figured out the molecular structure of a key protein that theΒ coronavirusΒ uses to invade human cells, potentially opening the door to the development of a vaccine, according to new findings. Previous research revealed that coronaviruses invade cells through so-called spike proteins, but those proteins take on different shapes in different coronaviruses. Figuring out the shape of the spike protein in SARS-Cov-2 is the key to figuring out how to target the virus, said Jason McLellan, senior author of the study and an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin. Though the coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells, the spike protein is the major surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor ” another protein that acts like a doorway into a human cell. After the spike protein binds to the human cell receptor, the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane, allowing the genome of the virus to enter human cells and begin infection. So if you can prevent attachment and fusion, you will prevent entry, McLellan told Live Science. But to target this protein, you need to know what it looks like.Β  Earlier this month, researchersΒ published the genomeΒ of SARS-Cov-2. Using that genome, McLellan and his team, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), identified the specific genes that code for the spike protein. They then sent that gene information to a company that created the genes and sent them back. The group then injected those genes into mammalian cells in a lab dish and those cells produced the spike proteins. Next, using a very detailed microscopy technique called cryogenic electron microscopy, the group created a 3D map, or blueprint, of the spike proteins. The blueprint revealed the structure of the molecule, mapping the location of each of its atoms in space.Β  It's impressive that these researchers were able to get the structure so quickly, said Aubree Gordon, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan who was not a part of the study. It's a very important step forward and may help in the development of a vaccine against SARS-COV-2. Stephen Morse, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health who was also not a part of the study agrees. The spike protein would be the likely choice for rapid development of vaccine antigens and treatments, he told Live Science in an email. Knowing the structure would be very helpful in developing vaccines and antibodies with good activity, as would producing higher quantities of these proteins, he added. The team is sending these atomic coordinates to dozens of research groups around the world who are working to develop vaccines and drugs to target SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, McLellan and his team hope to use the map of the spike protein as the basis for aΒ vaccine. When foreign invaders, such asΒ bacteriaΒ orΒ viruses, invade the body, immune cells fight back by producing proteins called antibodies. These antibodies bind to specific structures on the foreign invader, called the antigen. But producing antibodies can take time. Vaccines are dead or weakened antigens that train the immune system to create these antibodies before the body is exposed to the virus. In theory, the spike protein itself could be either the vaccine or variants of a vaccine, McLellan said. When you inject this spike-protein-based vaccine, humans would make antibodies against the spike, and then if they were ever exposed to the live virus, the body would be prepared, he added. Based on previous research they did on other coronaviruses, the researchers introduced mutations, or changes to create a more stable molecule. Indeed, the molecule looks really good; it's really well behaved; the structure kind of demonstrates that the molecule is stable in the correct confirmation that we were hoping for, McLellan said. So now we and others will use the molecule that we created as a basis for vaccine antigen. Their colleagues at the NIH will now inject these spike proteins into animals to see how well the proteins trigger antibody production. Still, McLellan thinks a vaccine is likely about 18 to 24 months away. That's still quite fast compared to normal vaccine development, which might take like 10 years, he said.Β  The findings were published today (Feb. 19) in the journalΒ Science.Β  Copyright 2020Β LIVESCIENCE.com, a Future company.

Those comments kicked off a social media firestorm, with reactions ranging from amusement to skepticism. Low was the alleged mastermind behind the missing funds from Malaysia's state investment firm 1MDB ” a charge that he repeatedly denied. His whereabouts were not known, but speculations had been pointing to China. This week, Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador said authorities previously received intelligence that Low was in the Chinese city of Wuhan, according to local media reports. He added that there's no new information on whether Low had left China. A new coronavirus called COVID-19, which is spreading quickly around the world, is believed to have originated from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. Hubei is also where most of the COVID-19 cases have been, with more than 62,000 infected persons so far. Social media users weighed in on Abdul Hamid's comments. ""Jho Low and Covid-19! Not sure which one is more dangerous for Wuhan!"" said a Twitter user with the handle @JayMenonP.  Another Twitter user, whose handle is @leonhartxtreme said: ""Jho Low spread the virus to hide in the place no one dare to enter. Maybe his next destination is Chernobyl.""  The user was referring to the location of the 1986 nuclear disaster, in what was at that time the Soviet Union and is now Ukraine. During that incident, considered by some as the worst nuclear accident in history, a reactor at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded and burned, making the areas inhabitable. Some social media users, however, were skeptical that Low might have been in Wuhan. ""Should we believe this garbage?"" asked @ariffnordin81.  The 1MDB scandal was investigated in at least six other countries including the U.S., Switzerland and Singapore. It played a part in bringing down former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.",finance

""What we've done is to prepare on the basis that it may go on for some months, and to make sure that we can stabilize and support businesses as well as our households during that period,"" said Indranee Rajah, a minister in the prime minister's office, who is also Singapore's second minister for finance and education. ""And we do still have some buffer in case any additional measures are needed,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia."" The Singapore government has set aside 5.6 billion Singapore dollars ($4.02 billion) in its latest budget to help businesses, workers and households weather the economic hit from the spread of the new coronavirus, called COVID-19. That planned spending is expected to contribute to a budget deficit of 10.95 billion Singapore dollars ” which some economists said is a record. That amount is about 2.1% of the country's gross domestic product. In theory, the wealthy Southeast Asian city-state can fund a bigger deficit than that because it has accumulated large surpluses from past years' budgets. Under Singapore's constitution, the government's revenue and expenditure must be balanced over a typical five-year term. In its current term starting 2016, the government has accumulated a budget surplus of 18.67 billion Singapore dollars, according to official data. The budget for 2020 is the fifth ” and most likely the last ” before the next electoral cycle. Singapore's next election is due by April 2021. Before the latest Singapore budget was announced on Tuesday, Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at brokerage Maybank Kim Eng, said it's ""customary for the government to transfer some part of the accumulated surplus to reserves."" Singapore has reported one of the highest numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases outside China. As of Thursday noon, the country has confirmed 85 cases, of which 37 have been discharged from hospitals, according to updates by the Ministry of Health. Singapore has been singled out by several analysts as one of the most economically vulnerable to the virus spread, given its close economic links with China. The country's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, also suggested that Singapore cannot rule out a recession. The government earlier this week downgraded its growth forecast for 2020 from between 0.5% and 2.5% to between -0.5% and 1.5%. Rajah said the possibility of a recession in Singapore depends on how long the current outbreak lasts. ""It's hard to say whether there will be a recession because if this situation resolves itself in, let's say, two, three months, then what you could see is a sharp rebound,"" she explained. ""On the other hand, if it drags out, then you've got a prolonged situation. So I think what we have to do is make sure we track it every step of the way.""",finance

And now with most of the earnings season in the books, look for the latest coronavirus headlines to fill the vacuum and weigh on stocks the rest of the month. Fourth-quarter profit growth for S&P 500 companies came in at 3.1%, and if the energy sector is excluded, the growth rate was 6.0%, according to Refinitiv. Just about four weeks ago, analysts expected a slight decline. However, the deluge of solid corporate results was largely overlooked by investors who are focusing on the spillover impact from the coronavirus on U.S. corporations. Stocks post losses this week as a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths deepened concerns about slowing global economic growth. Major U.S. companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble have sounded alarms on the disease, warning of a dent in profits down the road. ""The virus is totally underrated,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said on Friday. ""What I think is a little too premature is they all presume that it is going to be solved within a foreseeable time frame. At what point do we say that many, many companies are going to be hurt by the virus [and] we're paying too much for stocks."" Wall Street analysts have been quick to slash their earnings expectations for the next quarter in light of the fast-spreading virus. Expectations for earnings growth in the first quarter have been cut in half to just 3.2% from more than 6% at the start of 2020, according to Refinitiv.  Companies themselves are also lowering guidance for earnings growth in the near future. There have been more U.S. companies issuing below-consensus guidance for the next quarter than those with upbeat forecasts, marking the weakest ratio in a February since 2014, according to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America. ""While guidance is typically weak in the first quarter as corporates set a low bar, it has been more cautious than usual this earnings season, likely due to the coronavirus,"" Subramanian said in a note. Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies have cited coronavirus during their earnings call this season, according to FactSet. These companies' average revenue exposure to China is 7.2%, compared to 4.8% exposure for the average S&P 500 company. As of Friday, China's National Health Commission reported more than 75,000 confirmed cases and over 2,000 deaths on the mainland. South Korea has also reported more than 200 cases.

Please see our Privacy Notice for details of your data protection rights. The brain is arguably the most important organ in the body, helping you to control and coordinate actions and reactions, think and feel, and process memories and experience feelings. In other words, the brain forms the bedrock of what it means to be human. The ageing process can pose a threat to this essential organ, causing mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the stage of cognitive decline that precedes dementia. It can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes. While it is not exactly known how to prevent cognitive decline, promising evidence suggests lifestyle interventions can preserve and boost breath health, offering protection against brain decline. According to UK-based nutritionist Libby Limon, dietary supplements hold particular promise in this area. Here are five supplements shown to stave off the risk of cognitive decline: According to Limon, B vitamins, particularly folate are proving to play a major role in brain development and health from foetus all the way to old age. READ MORE: Best supplements for joints: Taking this supplement could significantly reduce joint pain Folate is one of the B-vitamins is needed to make red and white blood cells in the bone marrow, convert carbohydrates into energy, and produce DNA and RNA. Limon explains: Folate is integral in the methylation pathway which in the brain supports DNA replication. How efficient our methylation pathway is down to genetics, but supporting that pathway with plenty of dietary folate can make all the difference, especially to those that are poor methylators. DNA methylation is an example of one of the many mechanisms of epigenetics.

According to Limon, inflammation is often considered the root cause of degenerative brain diseases. Turmeric is potent anti-inflammatory, as such it has already shown potential in animal studies to reduce or help prevent brain cell damage, she says. As research progresses to human studies, turmeric's potential in boosting brain health is beginning to be unleashed.  Bacopa monnieri is an Ayurvedic herb that has been traditionally used to sharpen the mind and the intellect. As Limon reports, modern studies show like turmeric has anti-inflammatory effect on brain cells, thus have a protective effect. Healthy cells mean a healthy and sharp mind, she adds. Research has found that lion's mane mushrooms may protect against dementia, reduce mild symptoms of anxiety and depression and help repair nerve damage, explains Limon.  In one study, lion's mane dietary supplements appeared to give mice better object recognition and recognition memory. Other researchers have concluded that the mushrooms may have the potential to treat or prevent diseases that cause a decline in cognitive health, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

Adam Chapman,2/20/2020,express,Stomach bloating: Ease pain caused by constipation by drinking fennel tea,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1244942/stomach-bloating-pain-constipation-fennel-tea," Stomach bloating is a widespread complaint in the UK and is most commonly characterised as a puffy stomach, but symptoms can also include heartburn, nausea and vomiting. It is primarily caused by overindulging in gassy foods, such as beans and onions, so cutting down on these culprits can help to beat the bloat. Stomach bloating can also be caused by constipation, a condition characterised by not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel. If you're not emptying your gut, there's no room in your abdomen, and you'll have excess bloating, according to Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. If you are experiencing bloating as a result of constipation, a seed-based remedy has shown to be effective. A review investigating the uses of fennel for medicinal purposes has found that it has traditionally been used for digestive disorders, including abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and constipation. Taken as an herbal tea blend has been shown to provide particular relief for constipation. READ MORE: Stomach cancer symptoms: A burning sensation in this body part could signal the disease  When nursing-home residents with chronic constipation drank one daily serving of an herbal tea blend made with fennel seeds, they had an average of four more bowel movements over 28 days than those drinking a placebo. In addition, an animal study found that treatment with fennel extract helped protect rats against ulcers. Evidence suggests that preventing ulcers may reduce your risk of bloating. If you get constipation, a fibre-rich diet can help to fend off the condition, according to the NHS. READ MORE: Coronavirus named: What does COVID-19 stand for? Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]How to get rid of visceral fat: Why this popular food may reduce the dangerous belly fat [TIPS]Samia Ghadie health: It's like a daily battle' Star's crippling health issue [INSIGHT]  It's important to get fibre from a variety of sources, as eating too much of one type of food may not provide you with a healthy balanced diet, says the health body. Fibre rich foods include: Drinking lots of fluids and exercising regularly can also help to beat bloating caused by constipation. In fact, even a 20 to 30 minute brisk walk four times a week can improve your bowel function.  Exercise helps to strengthen the abdominal muscles, as Harvard Health explains: Good muscle tone in general is important for regular bowel movements. The abdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm all play a crucial role in the process of defecation. The health site continues: If these muscles are weak, they're not going to be able to do the job as well. Research has also drawn an indirect but beneficial link between regular exercise and a reduced risk of constipation.  One study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology examined whether a lack of physical exercise increased an individual's risk for constipation. The researchers asked about a thousand professionals to answer questions about constipation, physical activity, and quality of life. The results showed no correlation between physical activity and risk for constipation, but they did show that physical activity correlated with an increase in quality of life scores. Since constipation is associated with a lowered quality of life, exercise may be beneficial even if it does not directly improve constipation symptoms.

Adam Chapman,2/20/2020,express,High blood pressure: Causes include afternoon napping,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1244830/high-blood-pressure-causes-afternoon-napping-raise-reading," High blood pressure, if left untreated, can cause catastrophic damage to the body, the most serious being heart disease, a major killer both in the UK and worldwide. One of the most unsettling aspects of high blood pressure is that it tends to rise without any visible signs, so seemingly innocuous activities, such as eating certain foods, can send your blood pressure soaring without any external changes. While there are clear red lines, such as eating a diet high in salt, new research finds a surprising risk factor associated with high blood pressure. Research published in the science journal Heart and Lung found a strong association between taking an afternoon nap and raised blood pressure. Afternoon napping is a popular pastime, especially in hotter countries where temperatures rise after mid-day. The new research sends a chilling warning sign to afternoon nappers, however, finding that middle-aged and older women who napped for more than 90 minutes were 39 percent and 54 percent more likely to suffer high blood pressure. The association is based on a study looking at the lifestyle and health of nearly 8,000 Chinese adults over the age of 45. READ MORE: High blood pressure symptoms: Signs to look out for and how to measure your reading  It studied the health of people who did not take afternoon naps, those who slept for up to 30 minutes, those who napped for 30 to 59 minutes, 60 to 89 minutes and more than 90 minutes. The risk of high blood pressure was highest among women who napped in the afternoon for more than 90 minutes. Commenting on the findings, the researchers said: ""Our findings suggest that there are indeed significant associations between afternoon napping and hypertension. ""Extended afternoon napping of 90 minutes was associated with hypertension, especially in women and older adults. DON'T MISSCancer symptoms: Sweating at night could be a warning sign of this type of cancer [INSIGHT]Lyme disease: A peculiar feeling in the head is a warning sign of the condition [INSIGHT]Coronavirus named: What does COVID-19 stand for? Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]  The researchers continued: Specifically among women, extended afternoon napping was associated with higher risk of having hypertension and this association was more obvious among older women."" The researchers also noted that long afternoon naps may lead to disturbed night time sleeping patterns which have been shown to increase the risk of high blood pressure. Accounting for the association, the researchers suggest day napping may lead to a fragmented sleeping pattern and the sleep efficiency was low in those who took longer afternoon naps to compensate for sleep loss at night. They conclude: ""As a changeable lifestyle, afternoon napping habits may be adjusted to prevent hypertension and special attention needs to be paid to napping behaviour in middle-aged and older women.""  The damaging effects of not getting enough sleep at night is well understood. As Mayo Clinic reports, it's thought that sleeping fewer than six hours a night could be linked to increased blood pressure. People who sleep five hours or less a night may also be at higher risk of developing high blood pressure or worsening already high blood pressure. There's also an increased risk of high blood pressure for people who sleep between five and six hours a night, warns Mayo Clinic.  Mayo Clinic explains: It's thought that sleep helps your blood regulate stress hormones and helps your nervous system remain healthy. Over time, a lack of sleep could hurt your body's ability to regulate stress hormones, leading to high blood pressure. One way to treat high blood pressure triggered by sleep disturbances is to identify and address a potential underlying cause. One possible, treatable cause of your lack of sleep contributing to high blood pressure is obstructive sleep apnea ” a sleep disorder in which you repeatedly stop and start breathing during sleep, notes Mayo Clinic.

Adam Chapman,2/20/2020,express,Cancer symptoms: Signs include night sweats - treatment,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1244349/bone-cancer-symptoms-signs-night-sweats-pain-treatment," Cancer is a general term for abnormal cells that divide and multiply in the body, attacking nearby tissues and sometimes invading other areas. It is one of the leading causes of death in the world, in part because cancer is often untreatable if picked up at a later stage. Spotting the early indicators is therefore imperative to improve your chance of survival. There are more than 200 different types of cancer so the symptoms vary depending on where the cancer begins and where it has spread to. One lesser-known symptom to watch out for is sweating, particularly at night. Night sweats may signal bone cancer, a malignant tumour that arises from the cells that make up the bones of the body. This is also known as primary bone cancer. A malignant tumour is a cancerous mass or lump of tissue that may resemble swelling. READ MORE: Cancer symptoms: Have you spotted this coming out of your ear? Major warning sign  In addition to night sweats, a more common symptom associated with bone cancer is bone pain. The NHS explains: Pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This gradually progresses to a persistent ache or an ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting. Although it is not exactly known what causes most bone cancers, there are some factors that may increase your risk of developing it. According to the NHS, risk factors include: DON'T MISSHeart attack: Look out for this symptom on your fingernails - it could signal your risk [INSIGHT]Coronavirus named: What does COVID-19 stand for? Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]Vitamin D deficiency symptoms: The sign in your hair you could lack the sunshine vitamin' [INSIGHT]   According to Cancer Research UK, a popular misconception is that a knock or injury to a bone can cause cancer, but evidence does not support this claim. It's more likely that an injury causes swelling, which when it's investigated, shows up a cancer that is already there, says charity. Or a bone affected by cancer may be weakened and so is more likely to become damaged in an accident. Doctors may then spot the tumour when they are investigating your accident, it adds. Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health.  If you're experiencing bone pain, your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests, explains the NHS. According to the health site, they will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience “ whether it's constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse. According to the NHS, you may undergo surgery remove the section of cancerous bone “ it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, although amputation is occasionally necessary.  This may be combined with chemotherapy, a cancer treatment where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. In addition, radiotherapy may also form part of your treatment. Radiotherapy is a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells. If you have chemotherapy before surgery, the doctors will look at your tumour to see how well it has responded to chemotherapy. If you have a good response your outlook is better, explains the NHS.

Adam Chapman,2/20/2020,express,Dementia care: Taller young men may have a lower risk,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1244978/dementia-care-taller-young-men-lower-risk-diet," Dementia is an umbrella term for a collection of symptoms associated with brain damage, such as memory loss and lapses in concentration. There is currently no known way to prevent dementia, but advances in research have found certain factors may increase your risk, hinting at the possibility of prevention. A new study makes an important contribution to the existing body of literature, suggesting height may have a bearing on dementia risk, an association that may include genetic and environmental factors. Discussing the primary objective of the study, lead author Terese Sara HΓΈj JΓΈrgensen, Assistant Professor at the Section of Social Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, in Denmark, said: ""We wanted to see if body height in young men is associated with diagnosis of dementia, while exploring whether intelligence test scores, educational level, and underlying environmental and genetic factors shared by brothers explain the relationship. To put this into practice, JΓΈrgensen and her colleagues analysed data on 666,333 Danish men born between 1939 and 1959, including 70,608 brothers and 7,388 twins, from Danish national registries. They found a total of 10,599 men who developed dementia later in life. Their adjusted analysis of this group showed that there was about a 10 percent reduction in the risk of developing dementia for about every six centimetres of height in individuals above the average height. READ MORE: Dementia care: Study reveals how to reduce your partner's risk of brain decline  When the team took into account the potential role of intelligence or education, the unadjusted relationship between height and dementia risk was only slightly reduced. They also found that the relationship between height and dementia also existed when they looked at brothers with different heights, suggesting that genetics and family characteristics alone do not explain why shorter men had a greater dementia risk. This finding was consistent when they studied data concerning twins, although the results for this group were less certain. ""A key strength of our study is that it adjusted for the potential role of education and intelligence in young men's dementia risk, both of which may build up cognitive reserve and make this group less vulnerable to developing dementia,"" explains senior author Merete Osler, Professor at the Center for Clinical Research and Prevention, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, and at the University of Copenhagen.

Coronavirus name meaning [INSIGHT]  Cognitive reserve refers to the brain's ability to improvise and solve problems that come up in everyday life. According to Osler, adjusting for education and intelligence reduces the likelihood that the relationship between height and dementia is really explained by cognitive reserve. ""Together, our results point to an association between taller body height in young men and a lower risk of dementia diagnosis later in life, which persists even when adjusted for educational level and intelligence test scores,"" Osler said. She continues: ""Our analysis of the data concerning brothers confirms these findings, and suggests the association may have common roots in early-life environmental exposures that are not related to family factors shared by brothers.""  Osler also acknowledged one limitations of the study, however - the uncertainty as to whether these findings are generalisable to women, as previous studies on potential gender differences in the relationship between height and dementia are mostly inconclusive. According to the NHS, the latest research suggests that the following factors may also influence your risk: These include: The research concluded that by modifying the risk factors we are able to change, our risk of dementia could be reduced by up to 30 percent, reports the health site.  It also generally believed that what is good for your heart is good for your brain, so eating a heart-healthy diet may offer some protection against brain decline. To this end, the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet was created by researchers at Rush University in Chicago, to help prevent dementia and slow age-related loss of brain function. It's a combination of two diets already known to reduce risk of heart and circulatory disease: Both diets are backed by lots of research showing they can help your heart health, and some evidence to suggest they can contribute to lower levels of mental decline, according to the British Heart Foundation.

The FTSE 100-listed medical-technology company made a pretax profit of $743 million compared with $781 million a year before, it said. Net profit fell to $600 million from $663 million, the company said. Revenue increased 4.8% to $5.14 billion, Smith & Nephew said. On an underlying basis, revenue was up 4.4%, near the top end of the company's guidance of growth of between 3.5% and 4.5% and accelerating from a 2% growth rate in 2018. Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 8.7% to $1.41 billion, or 5.6% on an underlying basis, Smith & Nephew said. Trading profit margin was 22.8%, in line with guidance, the company said. Smith & Nephew said it expects underlying revenue growth for 2020 to be in a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, and trading profit margin to be at or slightly above that achieved in 2019. This outlook assumes the situation regarding the novel coronavirus epidemic normalizes early in the second quarter, the company said. In 2019, China represented 7% of the group's revenue, it said.

Alexandria Williams,2/20/2020,qz,Coronavirus: Chinese middlemen deplete Africa facemasks supply ” Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/,"In Nairobi's Kilimani district the upper floor of a typically quiet medical supply shop is hectic with Chinese customers ordering face masks for export. Employees frantically prove the authenticity of facemasks in a three-part burn, water and layer test for clients as they film, sending video evidence in WeChat groups for eager buyers back in China. Containing the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus has been a difficult task for Chinese authorities. Over the course of three months, the deadly virus has gone from an unconfirmed rumor, to an all out outbreak, infecting around 74,000 people and claiming the lives of over 2,000 people on mainland China to date. As the battle against coronavirus rages on, supplies of masks and no-contact thermometer guns have dwindled in China. The Chinese government says the country can only produce 20 million masks a day, half of what is needed in the current crisis. So, in an effort to meet ramped up demand, enterprising middlemen are now turning to African nations where a relatively limited supply of masks are made. In Kenya, the price of a 50-pack box of masks has skyrocketed from around $2 before the outbreak, to nearly $10 at the end of last week, some have orders have since topped $15. The local Nairobi business Quartz Africa visited this week has received an influx of orders is struggling to meet demand. On Friday, shop manager promised five days to fill an order promising that its factory had increased factory hours from 24 hour-day, five-day week, to to six days a week. By Saturday, the factory had run out of the cotton needed to produce the masks, but promised they were in the process of flying additional cotton supplies from Turkey. Merchants eager to get masks to China have also started to look to Tanzania meet their demand. Last week, the country had not yet been hit with as many masks demands and was able to sell masks at a fraction of what was being offered in Kenya. One Kenyan trader said the masks from Tanzania have been delivered via informal border backroadsΒ  in order to avoid tariffs. Kenya's no-contact thermometer guns have also been met with increased demand. According to an exporter, though some of the guns are made in Kenya, a good number were imported from China only to be exported back again. The average price of a thermometer gun has jumped by 40% to as high as $35 from around $25 before the outbreak. Demand for facemasks and other vital medical supplies have risen their price on the market globally. Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher, said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a news conference in Geneva this week. He has urged against hoarding medical resources during the crisis. This situation has been exacerbated by widespread and inappropriate use of [personal protective equipment] outside patient care. As a result, there are now depleted stockpiles and backlogs of four to six months. Global stocks of masks and respirators are now insufficient to meet the needs of WHO and our partners. The price of facemasks has increased tenfold in Indonesia. Last week, the Commerce Ministry of Laos set a ceiling for the price of face masks. In China a box of 50 facemasks (imported from the Netherlands) are reportedly being sold for as much as $71.27. Egypt, the only African country to have had a confirmed coronavirus case so far has also promised to supply facemasks to China which has ordered 200 million masks, but regulators have promised to prioritize local demand. Fear of the virus spreading throughout Africa is still high. A number of countries have stopped flights from China and placed quarantines on visitors from affected regions, but Ethiopia has been staunch in its refusal to restrict China bound flights. The African Union and the WHO have increased emergency preparedness efforts for coronavirus on the continent training eighty participants from eighteen African countries on enhanced surveillance at points of entry¦points of entry surveillance officers, national surveillance officers, airport authority officers, and representatives of airlines. But, if the outbreak does reach Africa, citizens are unsure if preparedness efforts alone will be enough.

Amelia Lucas,2/20/2020,cnbc,Domino's Pizza (DPZ) earnings Q4 2019 beat Wall Street estimates,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/20/dominos-pizza-dpz-earnings-q4-2019-beat-wall-street-estimates.html,"Domino's Pizza stock soared more than 25% on Thursday after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations after strong U.S. sales, despite increased competition. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: The pizza chain reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $129.3 million, or $3.12 per share, up from $111.6 million, or $2.62 per share, a year earlier. Higher royalty revenue from franchisees and lower general and administrative expenses drove the increase in net income. Excluding expenses from the company's recapitalization in 2019, Domino's earned $3.13 per share, topping the $2.98 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Net sales rose 6.3% to $1.15 billion, beating expectations of $1.13 billion. Domino's reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 3.4%, topping Wall Street's estimates of 2.3%. The chain has been facing greater competition from the likes of UberEats and DoorDash, putting pressure on Domino's U.S. delivery sales. ""We certainly still saw a lot of aggregator promotion and activity both on your television and, you know, digitally. While we felt like that leveled off a bit, relative to [the third quarter], the pressure was certainly still there and quite intense,"" CEO Ritch Allison told analysts on the conference call. The strong U.S. performance in the fourth quarter marked the first time in nearly two years that the pizza chain's same-store sales in its home market improved sequentially. Domino's reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 2.4% in the third quarter. RBC Capital Markets analyst Christopher Carril wrote in a note to clients that the acceleration in U.S. same-store sales growth is ""encouraging and evidence that incremental headwinds from said competition may be subsiding."" In response to the new competition, the pizza chain has been trying to grow its carryout sales and cut delivery times by strategically adding more U.S. locations. In 2019, restaurants open at least a year grew their carryout sales by 3.9%. Allison said that pizza chain is trying to drive more customers to place their carryout orders digitally, citing the opportunity for ""smarter"" ways to encourage customers to spend more. Domino's added 141 net new U.S. restaurants in the fourth quarter. Allison teased a new menu product coming this summer. He told analysts that the company decides to add products to look for incremental profits. ""We didn't sell salads to sell salads,"" he said. ""We sold salads to sell pizza."" International same-store sales increased by 1.7% in the quarter, falling short of estimates of 2.1%. Allison said that the fewer than 20 Chinese restaurants have closed temporarily in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The company does not expect to see any long-term impact on its business, as China is still a relatively small part of its portfolio. The pizza chain had roughly 260 locations in China, as of November. ""With this virus, there is a slowdown in the early part of the year in store openings,"" he said. The pizza chain also reaffirmed its two-to-three year outlook. Domino's expects U.S. same-store sales growth in a range of 2% to 5% and global retail sales growth of 7% to 10%. Domino's market value has risen 33% this year to more than $15 billion. During trading Thursday, shares traded as high as $381.86, a 52-week high.",finance

Citing forecasts, Shell said that LNG demand was expected to double by 2040 to 700 million tons, with natural gas set to play ""a growing role in shaping a lower-carbon energy system."" Shell added that LNG imports in China grew by 14% last year, while Bangladesh, India and Pakistan saw imports reach 36 million tons, representing growth of 19%. ""The global LNG market continued to evolve in 2019 with demand increasing for LNG and natural gas in power and non-power sectors,"" Maarten Wetselaar, integrated gas and new energies director at Shell, said in a statement issued Thursday. ""Record supply investments will meet people's growing need for the most flexible and cleanest-burning fossil fuel,"" he added. ""While we see weak market conditions today due to record new supply coming in, two successive mild winters and the Coronavirus situation, we expect equilibrium to return, driven by a combination of continued demand growth and reduction in new supply coming on-stream until the mid-2020s."" LNG refers to natural gas that has been cooled down to turn it into a liquid. This makes it easier to both store and transport. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the ""volume of the liquid is 600 times smaller than the gaseous form."" While natural gas is a fossil fuel, the EIA states that burning it for energy ""results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy."" In 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that ""coal-to-gas switching"" had saved approximately 500 million tons of CO2 since 2010. According to the IEA, natural gas consumption grew by 4.6% in 2018, with the organization stating that 80% of growth since 2010 has been concentrated in the U.S., China and Middle East. The IEA has said that a ""shale gas revolution"" in the U.S. is ""in full swing."" According to estimates from the EIA, dry shale gas production in the U.S. amounted to approximately 20.95 trillion cubic feet in 2018. This equates to roughly 69% of dry natural gas production in the U.S. for 2018, the EIA says.",finance
"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",2/20/2020,cnn,Markets were totally calm. Then stocks fell off a cliff,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/investing/dow-stock-market-selloff-today/index.html," It was shaping up to be a quiet day on Wall Street. Then around midday, stocks sold off sharply and investors scrambled. With no obvious catalyst triggering the selloff, worries about the coronavirus outbreak seemed to be the obvious suspect. At its worst, the Dow ( INDU ) was off by 388 points, with all three major stock indexes sharply in the red. The drop in stocks followed a dip in Treasury bond yields, which move opposite to prices, and implied that investor appetite for safe haven bonds was high. Still, investors scrambled to make sense of it. The dramatic selloff only lasted a short while and was followed by a swift rebound. Stocks still closed in the red, however, with the Dow ending 0.4%, or 128 points, lower. The S&P 500 ( SPX ) fell 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite ( COMP ) finished down 0.7%. In recent days, investor confidence built up amid hopes that new cases of the virus were slowing down. But Thursday South Korea confirmed new cases of the virus, hammering home that the outbreak is not over. The new cases ""are leading to concerns that the global supply chain will be impacted in a material way,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, in emailed comments. Read More This could be seen in price action in tech and semiconductor stocks, which led losses in the S&P 500. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) , for example, closed down nearly 3%. Tech giant Apple ( AAPL ) warned investors earlier this week that it won't meet its revenue guidance for the first quarter because of the virus outbreak. ""We expect more zigging and zagging,"" said Stephen Lee, founding principal at Logan Capital Management. But he added that the domestic economy is still fine. Lee also noted that US companies might be in a better position to deal with manufacturing shutdowns in China related to the coronavirus because many blue chip firms were already moving factories to other locations to avoid tariffs. While worries about the outbreak's fallout weighed on the technology sector, comments made by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida didn't make things better. Clarida told CNBC in an interview earlier Thursday he doesn't think the market expects an interest rate cut this year, although the CME FedWatch tool suggests otherwise. According to the data, market expectations are leaning towards another rate cut this summer this year. Lower interest rates are good for stocks as they make it cheaper for companies to borrow money or refinance their debt. --Paul La Monica contributed to this report.",general
Annie Palmer@annierpalmer,2/20/2020,cnbc,Amazon warns sellers on listings that make false coronavirus claims,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/20/amazon-warns-sellers-on-listings-that-make-false-coronavirus-claims.html,"Amazon is removing listings from its online marketplace that claim to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The company notified third-party merchants this week that it was taking down listings claiming to be a treatment, cure or remedy for the coronavirus, according to an email obtained by CNBC. It comes as the coronavirus outbreak has continued to worsen. The coronavirus has spread to more than two dozen countries, infecting more than 75,700 people and killing at least 2,130, as of Thursday. Last week, CNBC reported that Amazon was one of several tech giants that met with the World Health Organization at Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif. offices to discuss how to stop misinformation about the coronavirus on their platforms. Bad actors have attempted to make money off of fears around the coronavirus. On Amazon, sellers have offered books that stoke fears about the virus, while vitamin C products have increasingly surfaced because of false reports it can cure the coronavirus. Now, Amazon appears to be cracking down on mentions of the coronavirus in products listed on its marketplace. In one case, Amazon told a seller it would remove their listing for a surgical face masks because it made ""unapproved medical marketing claims."" As of Thursday afternoon, the product was available for purchase on Amazon. The company told third-party sellers it would consider reinstating the flagged listings if they removed the ""prohibited medical claims."" Here's an example of an email Amazon is sending to sellers who list products making claims about curing the coronavirus: Hello from Amazon, We are writing to let you know that the following detail pages have been removed from our catalog: ... This product has been identified as a face mask or related product that makes unapproved medical marketing claims regarding coronavirus or the flu. Products that make medical marketing claims may not be legally marketed in the U.S. without prior review and approval by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Amazon policy prohibits the listing or sale of products that are marketed as unapproved or unregistered medical devices We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.com. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon's policies. Users in Facebook groups for Amazon sellers have shared similar stories of warnings they received from Amazon this week. Although Amazon has taken steps to remove some listings mentioning the coronavirus, CNBC conducted a few quick searches and found several examples of products that appeared to flout these rules, including disinfectant sprays and cleaners that claimed to ""kill"" the coronavirus. One listing for a spray disinfectant claimed it met the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) criteria ""for use against the coronavirus."" Peter Dornau, President and CEO of Star brite, which makes the product, said the CDC statement was added to the listing by a third-party seller, which resulted in Amazon taking down the listing for several days. The listing was later reinstated after Star brite removed the claim, Dornau said. Star brite is monitoring any third-party listings of its products to make sure the descriptions are accurate, Dornau added. Another listing for a disinfectant from Kinzua Environmental also showed up for searches related to coronavirus on Amazon. It was not certified to kill the strain of virus that's currently causing the outbreak, but could kill other types of the virus. A representative from the company said he removed the listing. Representatives from Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. The products represent the latest issue for Amazon's marketplace. The marketplace, which now accounts for more than half of Amazon's overall sales, has also been proven to host counterfeit, unsafe and even expired goods. Amazon's marketplace is made up of millions of sellers who offer products, new and used, from all over the world that they purchase from official distributors, flea markets and clearance aisles. Amazon has said previously it invests heavily to prevent the sale of counterfeits and has zero tolerance for sellers who violate its policies.",finance
Arathy S Nair,2/20/2020,reuters,Oil prices rise as U.S. crude stocks build less than expected,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-prices-rise-as-u-s-crude-stocks-build-less-than-expected-idUSKBN20E07N,"Oil prices were up slightly on Thursday after the U.S. government reported a much smaller-than-anticipated rise in crude stocks, but gains were capped by worries about the spread of Coronavirus outside China. U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed crude inventories rose only 414,000 barrels last week, much less than the 2.5 million barrel build predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll. However, scores of new coronavirus cases and a first death in South Korea fanned fears of global pandemic as research suggested it could be more contagious than previously thought. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up 19 cents, or 0.32%, at $59.31 a barrel. The front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures contract, which expired Thursday, gained 49 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $53.78 a barrel. The more-active second-month WTI benchmark CLc2 was up 45 cents, or 0.8%, at $53.94 a barrel. Immediately after the EIA data, Brent front month, front month WTI and second month WTI touched their highest in February. Today's fresh fundamental input mainly cantered on the weekly EIA release that was widely perceived as supportive, Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. However, negative vibes from the coronavirus are unlikely to dissipate quickly and China's efforts to prop up their economy via Central bank rate adjustments is a limited solution in reviving economic activity, Ritterbusch said. China's move to cut its benchmark lending rate eased some worries about slowing demand in the world's second-biggest oil consumer and largest crude oil importer. U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell by about 2 million barrels in the week to Feb. 14, while analysts had estimated an increase of 435,000 barrels, according to the EIA data. The data also showed that U.S. East Coast refinery utilization rates fell last week to 59.2%, the lowest since November 2012. However, overall U.S. refinery utilization rates rose 1.4%, primarily as the refiners came out of maintenance. Also supporting oil prices were U.S. sanctions this week on a trading unit of Russian oil giant Rosneft for its ties with Venezuela's state-run PDVSA and conflict in Libya that has led to a blockade of its ports and oilfields. Brent could extend gains to $60.22 a barrel, as suggested by its wave pattern and a projection analysis, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Brent crude futures for nearby delivery were also trading at a premium to future months, a structure called backwardation, signalling a potential tightening in supplies.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not immediately provide details. The report came as South Korea is struggling to cope with the outbreak and its economic fallout. The mayor of the South Korean city of Daegu urged its 2.5 million people on Thursday to refrain from going outside as cases of a new virus, linked to a church congregation, spiked and he pleaded for help from the central government. Mayor Kwon Young-jin made the appeal in a nationally televised news conference after the southeastern city and its nearby towns reported 35 additional cases of infection with the new coronavirus on Thursday. Kwon also asked Daegu citizens to wear masks even indoors if possible. He expressed fears that the rising infections in the region will soon overwhelm the city's health infrastructure and called for urgent help from the central government in Seoul. National quarantine efforts that are currently focused on blocking the inflow of the virus (from China) and stemming its spread are inadequate for preventing the illness from circulating in local communities, Kwon said.",business

The passengers had already spent 14 days quarantined on board the ship, which had been docked in Japan, and now face another 14 days at the Howard Springs quarantine facility close to Darwin. These people need to go into quarantine because we are not entirely convinced that the quarantine procedures on that ship were 100% effective. By contrast, Japan's health ministry is allowing hundreds of people to leave the ship without being subject to further quarantine. Quarantines have been put in place around the world as part of the global public health response to COVID-19 “ the disease caused by a new coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2.  The idea is to limit the spread of the virus within and between countries. Formal measures designed to limit contact between infected (or potentially infected) people are called social distancing. And they have been used to control communicable diseases for at least 2,500 years. Today, the term quarantine refers to the separation or restriction of movement of people who are not ill but are believed to have been exposed to an infectious disease.  This differs to isolation, which is the term used for the separation or restriction of movement of people who are ill, thereby minimising onward transmission. Quarantine periods are determined by certain characteristics of the infectious agent, most notably the incubation period. This is the period between being exposed to it and symptoms appearing. For COVID-19, the average incubation period is thought to be around six days, and can range from two to 11 days. While a preliminary report has suggested a longer incubation period of up to 24 days, this is considered unlikely. People who have been in close contact with someone confirmed to have COVID-19 are considered to have been potentially exposed to the virus. As a precaution, these people are placed in quarantine, essentially to sit out their potential incubation period. The quarantine period of 14 days currently being used in Australia and elsewhere for COVID-19 takes into account the maximum known incubation period for this disease, plus a few extra days as a reasonable precaution. In quarantine, people will either develop the disease and have symptoms or they will remain well. In theory, if a person remains well after their period of quarantine, they are deemed uninfected and restrictions are lifted. Another factor that influences how long someone needs to be quarantined is the infectious period. That's the period during which the infection can be transmitted from one person to another. If the infectious period starts before the symptoms (from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals), the virus can be transmitted silently. This can substantially complicate disease prevention and control.  When a new virus emerges “ as with SARS-CoV-2 “ the infectious period is largely unknown. While the proportion of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases is not clear, it is increasingly apparent people can be infected without having any symptoms. However, further evidence is needed to see if these people can infect others. Crucial to quarantine is ensuring that best possible infection control practices are put in place to prevent ongoing transmission.  It is also essential to assess real-time data about newly diagnosed cases, which tells us how effective quarantine measures have been. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to extend a person's period of quarantine, as in the case of the Australian citizens on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess.

 Data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) give us clues to what's behind Australia's decision to impose a second period of quarantine. The graph below shows there may have been up to four possible waves of infections on board, including an initial undetected wave before quarantine measures were imposed. These data demonstrate ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission between people on board during the quarantine period. It also indicates breaches in infection control on board may have contributed to ongoing waves of infections, which an expert highlights in the video below. Evidence of ongoing transmission during the quarantine period supports the decision by several countries to evacuate their citizens from the Diamond Princess, including Australia, to reset the clock and to impose a further 14-day quarantine period. This additional measure “ while causing considerable and understandable frustration to those affected “ is designed to limit transmission of COVID-19 within Australia. Implementing public health measures, such as isolation and quarantine, requires decision-making that balances the rights of individuals and public good. When appropriately designed and implemented, quarantine and isolation work. Even when quarantine is not absolutely adhered to, it can still be effective at reducing the likelihood of large-scale outbreaks.  With SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), these strategies were thought to have been an important part in controlling the epidemic, though they were resource and labour intensive.",business

One trial combines HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir, while the other is testing U.S.-based biotech Gilead Sciences' antiviral Remdesivir, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday at a news conference at the agency's headquarters. ""Even if people are infected, having better outcomes, saving their lives, is really key,"" Tedros said. There are currently no proven therapies for the new virus, which has killed at least 2,130 people and sicked more than 75,700 worldwide, Dr. Janet Diaz, lead for clinical case management in the WHO Health Emergencies program, said Thursday. Some scientists had claimed that anti-malaria drug Chloroquine could be a potential treatment for the new virus, but currently, there is ""no proof"" that it is effective, Diaz told reporters. Local authorities in China have been using Gilead's Remdesivir, which was tested as a possible treatment during the Ebola outbreak, to fight infections. Some authorities are also using antiviral drug Kaletra, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, on a compassionate basis. In the meantime, scientists are also working quickly to produce a vaccine candidate to be ready for human clinical trials. U.S. health officials are fast-tracking work on a coronavirus vaccine, hoping to start an early-stage trial within the next two and a half months, the Trump administration said earlier this month. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, said on Feb. 13 that there could be new information on possible vaccine candidates in ""weeks."" Hopes to get a vaccine to market are high, but doctors want expectations to be low for how quickly it can happen. Developing, testing and reviewing any potential vaccine is a long, complex and expensive endeavor that could take months or even years, global health experts say.",finance
Berkeley Lovelace Jr.@BerkeleyJr,2/20/2020,cnbc,US hospitals brace for coronavirus outbreak to become global pandemic,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/19/hospitals-across-the-us-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak-to-become-global-pandemic.html,"""This is the time to open up your pandemic plans and see that things are in order,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, a top official of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged hospitals last week as an outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus ravaged much of China. ""For instance,"" she continued, health-care providers need to plan for a ""surge at a hospital, the ability to provide personal protective equipment for your workforce, the administrative controls and so forth that you might put place in a health care setting."" Schuchat's warning came as U.S. and world health officials increasingly sound the alarm of a possible pandemic outbreak of the deadly new coronavirus that has killed more than 2,100 people in China in the last seven weeks. The COVID-19 epidemic in China has not yet met world health officials' designation of a global pandemic that spreads far and wide throughout the world. While it has spread to more than two dozen countries, international health officials say there's very little transmission on local levels outside of China right now. But they've warned that could quickly change. The virus is proving to be far more contagious than the flu, having spread from 300 people in mid-January to more than 75,700 as of Thursday morning. While a majority of those cases are in China ” with just 15 confirmed in the U.S. ” the CDC has been working with the health-care sector to prepare for the virus to ""take a foothold in the U.S,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Feb. 12. ""At some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S. or in other countries,"" she warned. U.S. hospitals from San Diego to New York are taking heed. The threat of the new virus comes at an already busy time for most U.S. hospitals. Another serious respiratory illness, the seasonal flu, is at its peak in the United States, with more than 26 million cases and many hospitals stretched thin. A larger spread of the new virus across the U.S. could overwhelm emergency rooms and quickly cause supply shortages of some crucial medical supplies, according to half a dozen interviews with doctors, U.S. hospitals and health systems. Hospital staff at San Diego-based Scripps Health are consolidating medical supplies such as masks, gloves and gowns and have ordered backup reserves in case of a widespread outbreak in the United State, said Dr. Ghazala Sharieff, chief medical officer. Health-care workers are being taught how to reuse N95 respirator masks, most often used to control exposures to infections, in case of wide-spread shortages, she said. Patients presenting flu-like symptoms are also being asked on a questionnaire about their recent travel history, including whether they've been to China in the last 14 days or have been in close contact with anyone who has, she said. ""We don't know what happens next, but we are prepared,"" Sharieff said. ""We are fine with supplies right now but we don't want to get caught without supplies."" So far, 26 people have been screened for possible exposure to the coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China, over a month ago, Sharieff said. One of the patients actually met the qualifications for having the virus before further testing came back negative, she said. Early during the outbreak, patients were coming in concerned they may have been exposed to the virus,but that has since tapered off, she said. ""I think we've done a good job educating people,"" she said. ""When we first started, there were people in the community saying they were worried that they stood next to someone at the airport who had a mask on. ... I think they realized that that is probably a little bit of panic on their behalf."" At Northside Hospital, a network of hospitals and medical facilities in Atlanta, the staff is continuously monitoring the coronavirus outbreak, according to a spokesperson. The hospital said if a patient has any clinical symptoms and has recently traveled from Wuhan, or if they have been in close contact with a person who is under investigation for the virus, they will be masked and taken directly to an airborne isolation room, where they will remain while in the hospital. ""Infection control and prevention measures are always a priority,"" spokeswoman Katherine Watson said. Staff at NYU Langone Health in New York City has designated the new virus as a ""level 1"" priority. ""A big part of this level is communication,"" said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, hospital epidemiologist there. ""We are trying to communicate to NYU staff and patients in our medical center how to best protect themselves from the flu or COVID-19,"" Lighter said. ""That's just general info like basic hand hygiene, sneezing into the end of your elbow and practicing safe distance from someone who is sick."" NYU is also preparing for a level 2 or 3 scenario, she added, where there is transmission in the city and it begins to impact hospital operations. The health-care system has implemented a conservation plan and medical supplies, especially respirator masks, are only given to staff as needed, she said. ""If a team needed more, they would have to be infection-prevention approved or manager approved before someone would get more,"" she said, adding staff is already feeling the brunt of the flu season. The hospital is also recommending patients with more mild symptoms to stay at home, she said. The hospital has been ramping up its virtual urgent care, including training doctors and purchasing more iPads and other machines. ""If you're shortness of breath, obviously, please come in,"" Lighter said. Dr. Robert Citronberg, director of infectious diseases with Advocate Health Care in Illinois, said the risk of the coronavirus becoming widespread in the U.S. remains ""low,"" citing the country's strong health-care infrastructure. But that doesn't mean health-care workers are complacent, he said. Citronberg, who works out of Park Ridge, northwest of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, said there's always the potential of someone getting off a plane with exposure to the virus. ""We certainly are not complacent about that possibility,"" he said. ""We are really trying to reinforce with our front-line staff particularly that you still got to be alert, you've still got to be on your toes."" Citronberg said,. He added that the health-care system doesn't have any ""imminent problems"" with medical supplies such as masks and gloves because it already stocked up on them due to the flu season. They are asking every patient whether they've recently traveled to China or had contact with anyone who has been there. Advocate has also increased its use of telemedicine over the last few years and that may be useful in handling a outbreak, he said.",finance
"By Adam Goldman, Julian E. Barnes, Maggie Haberman and Nicholas Fandos",2/20/2020,nytimes,Lawmakers Are Warned That Russia Is Meddling to Re-elect Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/us/politics/russian-interference-trump-democrats.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR1svOWR8ocLSQp3hdv53AXfmz1YkvDsQypIXJx0ceaLFLLviJZNYz01Ang,"WASHINGTON ” Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him. The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, the president berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump was particularly irritated that Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the leader of the impeachment proceedings, was at the briefing. During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he had been tough on Russia and that he had strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying the conclusions could have been delivered in a less pointed manner or left out entirely to avoid angering Republicans. The intelligence official who delivered the briefing, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire and has a reputation for speaking bluntly. Though intelligence officials have previously told lawmakers that Russia's interference campaign was continuing, last week's briefing included what appeared to be new information: that Russia intended to interfere with the 2020 Democratic primaries as well as the general election. On Wednesday, the president announced that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and an aggressively vocal Trump supporter. And though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing might have played a role in that move, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Mr. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Mr. Trump had never felt a kinship with Mr. Maguire. Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about the integrity of our upcoming elections and said that members of both parties attended, including Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee. In a tweet on Thursday evening, Mr. Schiff said that it appeared that Mr. Trump was again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling with his objections to the briefing. transcript From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.  Today: U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Russian government is supporting two very different candidates in the 2020 presidential race. David Sanger on why Russia is rooting for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. It's Wednesday, February 26. David, tell us about these intelligence briefings. Well, the first one, and in some ways the most interesting one, is shrouded in a lot of mystery. We know that about a month ago, the F.B.I. went to Bernie Sanders. Mm-hmm. The F.B.I. frequently comes around to give general warnings to all the candidates, but that's not what this was all about. This was about a very specific finding. And their message was, we have reason to believe that the Russians, through their own calculus, have determined that you're their favorite candidate among the Democrats in the primary. Hmm. And that they may well already be intervening on your behalf. And David, what was Sanders's reaction, as both a senator and a presidential candidate, to this piece of information? The only reaction that we know about, Michael, is that he decided to keep it secret. He hasn't said very much about what he thought about it. He just decided to say nothing about it, which itself is a really interesting choice. What do you mean? Well, he said that because it was classified, and he doesn't talk about classified briefings, he just stayed silent. But there are lots of political reasons for him to stay silent as well. Like what? He doesn't want to appear or be portrayed by President Trump as Russia's favorite or Russia's dupe in the election. If you're Bernie Sanders and you're thinking ahead to the general election, you only want one Russian puppet to be in this election, and you want it to be Donald Trump. So he knew right away that Trump would use this as an effort to try to equalize what the Russians were doing on behalf of President Trump in 2016 ” Gotcha. ” and what we think they will be doing with what they're doing with Bernie Sanders. Because if the Russians are backing both of them, it's like the Russians are backing neither of them. OK, so that's intelligence briefing number one. What about the second one? Well, the second one is bigger, a lot more formal, and we know a lot more about it. It was February 13. [MUSIC]: And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. We are live from Las Vegas where, in less than an hour, our Democratic presidential town halls will begin. And we have more on that in just a moment. But first, the breaking news. And the Director of National Intelligence Office, Shelby Pierson, has the unenviable job of being the mission manager for election interference for the Director of National Intelligence, goes in to brief the House Intelligence Committee. Hmm. And so the first thing she says is: There is Russian interference underway. The second thing she says is: The Russians had and still have a preference for Donald Trump as president. So unlike the Sanders briefing, this one does leak. This is not a four-year-ago flashback, folks. This is 2020. Well, Democrats are rekindling an old flame ” Russia collusion. Yes. I mean, this is so idiotic. And you notice how when they win elections, the Russians didn't do anything? Mm. So ” And a few days after that leaks out, we learn about the Sanders briefing a month before. And of course, as soon as these leak, everyone's furious. And if this came out a month ago, how do you think it came out now, if you had the briefing a month ago? I'll let you guess about one day before the Iowa ” Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? It was The Washington Post? Good friends. Sanders is furious that the news of his briefing came out just before the Nevada caucuses. Right. And blames, among others, corporate media. Because The Washington Post had, I think, first broken this story. President Trump is furious that it's back in the ether again that the Russians are involved in the election and behind him. Here we go again. Did you see it? This story. Aren't people bored? And so at a rally in Las Vegas, he says, this is all fabrication. It's all coming from the Democrats. I was told that was happening. I was told a week ago. They said, you know, they're trying to start a rumor. It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done ” Do Nothing Democrats. No, actually, it was coming from his own Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all of whom work for him. These people are crazy! So regardless of how this became public ” and it seems like both Sanders and Trump are very unhappy that it did become public ” it is public now that Russia is supportive of both President Trump and Bernie Sanders. So how did the intelligence community come to that conclusion? What are they seeing out there? Well, we don't know exactly how they came to it, because this is wrapped up in their sources and methods ” the one thing that they protect more than anything. Mm-hmm. We think they have humans sources inside Russia. They certainly did in 2016, a unique human source who had access to the Kremlin. They certainly have lines into Russian networks. That's what the National Security Agency does. And finally, they get to see some of the product as it shows up on Facebook or Reddit or something like that. Mm-hmm. And here, the differences from 2016 are really fascinating. Like what? Well, in 2016, you'll remember that there were Russians who were posing as Americans and putting out Facebook ads or going into Facebook posts. They got booted off for inauthentic behavior ” they weren't really Americans. So what are they doing now? They're putting much of the same kind of propaganda and false charges on forums like Reddit, hoping that they will get picked up by real Facebook users, who are real Americans, and will be repeated on their posts. And of course, Facebook can't throw them off, because they're real Americans expressing their political views. They're protected by First Amendment rights. And it would be pretty unseemly if Facebook began tossing off Americans saying, oh, you heard that from a Russian bot. Hmm. In the Cold War, the Soviets called these people useful idiots because they unintentionally picked up a Russian theme, a piece of disinformation, and repeated it until it became organic. Right. In the election, they might call them useful partisans, because they're going to pluck this out of the political ether, repeat it on cable television, presumably in support of Senator Sanders or President Trump, or maybe someone else who emerges. So David, how do you make sense of the fact that Russia is trying to help the two candidates in the race who are about as ideologically far apart as imaginable ” Trump, Sanders ” at the same time? Well, Michael, I've been trying to puzzle this out, because at first, it didn't seem to make any sense to me. And then, the more interviewing I did with more experts that I trust, they all said, you know, David, actually, it makes perfect sense. And it makes perfect sense for three reasons. So the first one is that both these candidates are at the outer extremes of their own parties. Not the far extreme, but they attract really partisan supporters. And the best way to create chaos is to have two polarized groups of political supporters going after each other. Mm. You know, the Trump supporters and the Sanders supporters, they don't leave a whole lot of space in the middle. And if you're the Russians, that's perfect. It's the equivalent of creating a drought in the forest, just before you toss in the match. Remember, the Russians don't go out and create the conditions. All they do is go out and exploit the conditions. Help me understand what the exploitation of a polarized Sanders and Trump electorate looks like. Well, you could take any of a number of issues that are hot-button social issues and use that to further divide Americans. We give hundreds of millions of dollars. You know what they give to us? Nothing. Nothing. They give us nothing. Criminals! You can use immigration, right? On which they differ dramatically. Day one, we will rescind all of Trump's hateful and racist immigration executive orders. [APPLAUSE] You can use Medicare for All, on which they differ dramatically. You could use the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, on which they differ dramatically. So ” And just kind of pump up those issues on social media, on your Reddit page, and hope it gets picked up on Facebook. And just generally make Americans angry at each other over it? Have the country screaming at each other. Bottom line is Donald Trump is dangerous and toxic for this country. For many reasons, I think Bernie Sanders is a dangerous man, but the thing that I thought ” I do. I mean, I think he's a very dangerous man. This is someone who is not stable. And I've been saying it from the beginning, and I will continue to say it until somebody looks into his mental stability. The socialist wing has completely taken over and is now in control, where the moderate voices no longer matter at this point in the race. And why is chaos good for Russia? I can tell why it's bad for us. It makes the United States look like a place that can't get its act together. It helps lead to charges of election interference and election irregularities that bring American elections down to the level of Russian elections. Hmm. It makes democracy look like a chaotic form of governance that can't really be trusted to make progress.  Best of all, you're weakening the United States, keeping it consumed in some domestic furor, rather than thinking about pushing back against the Russians in Syria, or elsewhere in the Middle East, or in Crimea, or coming to the support of your allies in NATO. We'll be right back. OK. So that's theory number one, which kind of seems to see both of these candidates as co-equals in the creation of a chaotic American political life. That's right. What is theory number two for why Russia would be rooting for both Trump and Sanders? Well, theory number two is truly cynical, Michael. It's that the Russians really do favor Trump, and they think that Bernie Sanders is the most beatable Democrat. Hmm. Now, they may be wrong about that. There's lots of polling that suggest he could win. But the Russians's calculus at this moment may be that if you want to keep Donald Trump in office, Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to go do that. Gotcha. Now, that then raises the question, why would they continue to support Trump? And I think the answer to that is that Donald Trump is the only member of the Trump administration who doesn't sign on to the anti-Russian cast of American policy.  Official policy is, we push back on the Russians from Ukraine to the Middle East and so forth. Donald Trump doesn't want to hear any of that. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia and a very good chance ” a very good relationship with President Putin. I would hope ” Putin, obviously, likes that. That's right. Official policy is we continue sanctions on the Russians. A lot of people say having Russia ” which is a power ” having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G7 that felt that way. And we didn't take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it. My inclination is to say, yes, they should be in. Donald Trump's been talking to the French about letting Russia back into the G8, the group of eight countries, and beginning to lift sanctions. Official policy is that we keep sanctions on as long as the Russians continue to annex Crimea. You know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that also. Donald Trump's view is, why do we care about Crimea anyway? Why don't the other neighbors care about that? So they have all kinds of reasons to believe that Donald Trump in the second term would be a continuation of the Donald Trump in the first term, who wasn't going to give them a hard time about their territorial or nuclear ambitions. OK, that's the Trump side of this. What makes the Russians convinced that Sanders is the most beatable Democrat? Because as you said, that's not exactly what the polling suggests. It isn't what the polling suggests, and it's an interesting question why they believe that. Remember, the Russians didn't think Donald Trump was going to win early in the last presidential cycle and really only came to supporting him in an active way in the very last months of the campaign. So they may not know right now any more than we know. Why would they know? Mm-hmm. You know, when Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? But they look at Bernie Sanders, and they see somebody who talks in ways that other American politicians rarely do. How many other American politicians have come out and said admiring things about Fidel Castro? Mm. You know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. How many other American candidates have proudly called themselves democratic socialists? So they think that all of these things make Sanders vulnerable to the charge from President Trump that Sanders is actually the Russian-loving socialist in the race. OK, so what is the third explanation for why Russia would support both candidates? Well, the third explanation is life is uncertain, and they could live with Bernie Sanders. Hmm. And why? Today, we are preparing to send soldiers to Afghanistan who were not even born on September 11, 2001. Because, like Donald Trump, he's got a real aversion to interventions around the world. We have got to stop endless wars. We have got to cut military spending. So that you can pay for Medicare for All and other social programs. So the thinking is that Russia would be quite happy, maybe even elated, with four more years of Donald Trump. But if they're going to have to live with a Democratic president, they're perfectly fine with Bernie Sanders. Especially because the Democrats have become the party of anti-Russia sentiment. Hmm. Right? It's almost a flip from what we thought about in the post-Cold War era where the Democrats were all about integrating Russia into the world community, making them part of the G8, coming up with economic packages, turning them into a European nation. Remember all that? Mm-hmm. You haven't heard a word of that from any of the Democrats now except Sanders. And so you're now seeing Bernie Sanders just in the past few days ” And what I say to Mr. Putin ” if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections. Senator ” ” begin to try to sound a bit tougher in his international relations views, precisely because he recognizes this is a big vulnerability. Mr. Putin is a thug. He is an autocrat. He may be a friend of Donald Trump's. He's not a friend of mine. Let me tell you ” So right now, we still don't have the evidence. Remember, in the 2016 election, it wasn't until 2017 ” really, after Donald Trump was about to be inaugurated ” that we got a sense of the scope of the Russian effort. Mm. What we do know is that Bernie Sanders now has a Russia problem. Mm. And that problem, if anything, is probably going to drive him to sound more hostile to Moscow than he naturally would be or he has been in the past. And how does that serve Russia? I'm not sure it does. Because once influence operations are exposed, it can drive the intended target ” in this case, Bernie Sanders and his supporters ” to the opposite corner. Mm-hmm. So you know, Donald Trump today is the last politician in America who could actually get behind lifting sanctions against Russia, because everybody would say, you're in Putin's pocket. And they run the risk of driving Bernie Sanders from the candidate who wanted to go talk to the Russians, to the candidate who could never talk to the Russians. Hmm.  Thank you, David. Thank you. This is ” Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you into this conversation. Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders? During Tuesday night's Democratic debate in South Carolina, candidates repeatedly invoked Russia's support for Trump and Sanders, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying that Russia favored them because they represent political extremes. I'll tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos. And chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. At one point, Mike Bloomberg turned to Sanders and declared that the reason Russia supported Sanders was because its government believed that Sanders would lose to Trump. Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States. And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you'll lose to him. Oh, Mr. Bloomberg! Sanders, in response, denounced Russia's efforts to meddle in the election. And let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, trying to bring Americans against Americans ” hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not gonna interfere in any more American elections. For highlights and analysis of that debate, listen to this morning's episode of The Latest. You can find it on the Daily Feed or by searching for The Latest wherever you listen. We'll be right back.  Here's what else you need to know today. Now, it's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will become infected. On Tuesday, health officials warned that the coronavirus will almost certainly begin spreading across the United States and that Americans should begin preparations now. During a news conference, Doctor Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that an American outbreak might require a wide range of actions, from closing schools to asking employees to work from home. We will be transparent with the public about these measures and the potential that these tools will be necessary. There is literally a playbook for the use of these tools. As of Tuesday night, the U.S. had 57 confirmed cases of the virus, all of whom are in isolation in hospitals. That's it for The Daily. I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. Mr. Trump has long accused the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's 2016 interference as the work of a deep state conspiracy intent on undermining the validity of his election. Intelligence officials feel burned by their experience after the last election, when their work became a subject of intense political debate and is now a focus of a Justice Department investigation. Part of the president's anger stemmed from the administration's reluctance to provide delicate information to Mr. Schiff. He has been a leading critic of Mr. Trump since 2016, doggedly investigating Russian election interference and later leading the impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine. Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Schiff would weaponize the intelligence about Russia's support for him, according to a person familiar with the briefing. And he was angry that he was not told right away about the briefing, the person said. Mr. Trump has fixated on Mr. Schiff since the impeachment saga began, pummeling him publicly with insults and unfounded accusations of corruption. In October, Mr. Trump refused to invite lawmakers from the congressional intelligence committees to a White House briefing on Syria because he did not want Mr. Schiff there, according to three people briefed on the matter. The president did not erupt at Mr. Maguire, and instead just asked pointed questions, according to the person. But the message was unmistakable: He was not happy. Ms. Pierson, officials said, was delivering the conclusion of multiple intelligence agencies, not her own opinion. The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Maguire, but not the substance of the disagreement. The intelligence community issued an assessment in early 2017 that President Vladimir V. Putin personally ordered a campaign of influence in the previous year's election and developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. But Republicans have long argued that Moscow's campaign was intended to sow chaos, not aid Mr. Trump specifically. Some Republicans have accused the intelligence agencies of opposing Mr. Trump, but intelligence officials reject those accusations. They fiercely guard their work as nonpartisan, saying it is the only way to ensure its validity. At the House briefing, Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, who has been considered for the director's post, was among the Republicans who challenged the conclusion about Russia's support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Stewart insisted that the president had aggressively confronted Moscow, providing anti-tank weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russia-backed separatists and strengthening the NATO alliance with new resources, according to two people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Stewart declined to discuss the briefing but said that Moscow had no reason to support Mr. Trump. He pointed to the president's work to confront Iran, a Russian ally, and encourage European energy independence from Moscow. I'd challenge anyone to give me a real-world argument where Putin would rather have President Trump and not Bernie Sanders, Mr. Stewart said in an interview, referring to the nominal Democratic primary race front-runner. Under Mr. Putin, Russian intelligence has long sought to stir turmoil among around the world. The United States and key allies on Thursday accused Russian military intelligence, the group responsible for much of the 2016 election interference in the United States, of a cyberattack on neighboring Georgia that took out websites and television broadcasts. The Russians have been preparing ” and experimenting ” for the 2020 election, undeterred by American efforts to thwart them but aware that they needed a new playbook of as-yet-undetectable methods, United States officials said. They have made more creative use of Facebook and other social media. Rather than impersonating Americans as they did in 2016, Russian operatives are working to get Americans to repeat disinformation, the officials said. That strategy gets around social media companies' rules that prohibit inauthentic speech. And the Russians are working from servers in the United States, rather than abroad, knowing that American intelligence agencies are prohibited from operating inside the country. (The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are allowed to do so with aid from the intelligence agencies.) Russian hackers have also infiltrated Iran's cyberwarfare unit, perhaps with the intent of launching attacks that would look like they were coming from Tehran, the National Security Agency has warned. Some officials believe that foreign powers, possibly including Russia, could use ransomware attacks, like those that have debilitated some local governments, to damage or interfere with voting systems or registration databases. Still, much of the Russian aim is similar to its 2016 interference, officials said: search for issues that stir controversy in the United States and use various methods to stoke division. One of Moscow's main goals is to undermine confidence in American election systems, intelligence officials have told lawmakers, seeking to sow doubts over close elections and recounts. American officials have said they want to maintain confidence in the country's voting systems, so confronting those Russian efforts is difficult. Both Republicans and Democrats asked the intelligence agencies to hand over the underlying material that prompted their conclusion that Russia again is favoring Mr. Trump's election. Although the intelligence conclusion that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2020 Democratic primaries is new, in the 2019 report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, there is a reference to Russian desires to help Mr. Sanders in his presidential primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016. The report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency, a troll factory sponsored by Russian intelligence, in an order to its operatives: Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump ” we support them. How soon the House committee might get that information is not clear. Since the impeachment inquiry, tensions have risen between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the committee. As officials navigate the disputes, the intelligence agencies have slowed the amount of material they provide to the House, officials said. The agencies are required by law to regularly brief Congress on threats. While Republicans have long been critical of the Obama administration for not doing enough to track and deter Russian interference in 2016, current and former intelligence officials said the party is at risk of making a similar mistake now. Mr. Trump has been reluctant to even hear about election interference, and Republicans dislike discussing it publicly. The aftermath of last week's briefing prompted some intelligence officials to voice concerns that the White House will dismantle a key election security effort by Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence: the establishment of an election interference czar. Ms. Pierson has held the post since last summer. And some current and former intelligence officials expressed fears that Mr. Grenell may have been put in place explicitly to slow the pace of information on election interference to Congress. The revelations about Mr. Trump's confrontation with Mr. Maguire raised new concerns about Mr. Grenell's appointment, said the Democratic House committee official, who added that the upcoming election could be more vulnerable to foreign interference. Mr. Trump, former officials have said, is typically uninterested in election interference briefings, and Mr. Grenell might see it as unwise to emphasize such intelligence with the president. The biggest concern I would have is if the intelligence community was not forthcoming and not providing the analysis in the run-up to the next election, said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security. It is really concerning that this is happening in the run-up to an election. Mr. Grenell's unbridled loyalty is clearly important to Mr. Trump but may not be ideally suited for an intelligence chief making difficult decisions about what to brief to the president and Congress, Ms. Kendall-Taylor said. Trump is trying to whitewash or rewrite the narrative about Russia's involvement in the election, she said. Grenell's appointment suggests he is really serious about that. The acting deputy to Mr. Maguire, Andrew P. Hallman, will step down on Friday, officials said, paving the way for Mr. Grenell to put in place his own management team. Mr. Hallman was the intelligence office's principal executive, but since the resignation in August of the previous deputy, Sue Gordon, he has been performing the duties of that post. Mr. Maguire is planning to leave government, according to an American official. Adam Goldman, Julian E. Barnes and Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

By Karen Weise and Michael Corkery,2/20/2020,nytimes,Clicking Buy on Amazon? It's Trying to Prevent a Coronavirus Caveat,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/amazon-coronavirus-supplies.html,"SEATTLE ” What if the Everything Store couldn't sell everything because of disruptions from the coronavirus? That's the situation that Amazon ” which typically stocks more than 100 million items, from toilet paper to yoga pants ” is working to avoid as the deadly outbreak continues to shut down and slow factories in China that produce the world's goods. Over the past few weeks, Amazon has responded to the crisis by making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States, according to company emails and consultants who work with major brands. Some of its suppliers have cut back on advertising and promotions on the site so they don't run out of products too quickly. Amazon also sent an urgent email to brands on Wednesday about Prime Day, its midsummer mega sale, indicating that it has begun worrying about inventory for the event. And the company has contacted some of its third-party merchants, whose dog leashes, crayons and other products account for about 60 percent of its sales, to figure out how their flow of goods might be impeded. Hello! read one recent email from Amazon to a seller, which The New York Times reviewed. We have identified that part of your supply chain process might be China dependent and in light of the coronavirus outbreak effecting manufacturing and logistics in China, we are reaching out to you to understand its impact on your business operations. With its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, Amazon is turning into a case study of how a giant retailer grapples with the fallout from the coronavirus and what may lie ahead for other stores. Already dozens of companies have indicated that the virus will take a toll on them, with Apple cutting its sales expectations this week and airlines canceling flights to China. Retailers have so far said less about how the coronavirus will affect them. On Tuesday, Walmart said sales at its 430 stores in China had not faltered and added that the impact on its supply chain was unclear but might be more muted than at other companies. Last year's trade war with China may inadvertently be helping some big retailers now. At the time, companies imported more goods than usual from China to get ahead of expected tariffs. Some moved manufacturing to Vietnam and other Asian countries. When the new tariffs never took effect, retailers were left with more supply and more sourcing from other countries already in place. Still, if China Inc. continues to be fitful beyond the next few weeks, major stores could run out of everyday products like sponges, print cartridges and construction paper by mid-April, according to a report from Wells Fargo last week. China is the largest source of imported consumer goods. We believe the time to start worrying about the supply chain risk of the virus is here, the report said. Amazon is likely to feel potential shortages of goods earlier than its American peers because it usually keeps fewer items on hand than they do. In good times, that lets the internet company run more efficiently because it does not tie up money to buy and store products that are waiting to be sold. But that approach, called lean inventory, exposes Amazon more to shocks. This is a cost to pay for the efficiency that a just-in-time supply chain gets you, said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee and the founder of CommerceIQ, a start-up whose automation tools are used by major brands including Kimberly-Clark and Logitech. Some supply problems may be hidden. Even products made in America can rely on Chinese suppliers, which may cause problems down the line. Ketchup made in a plant in Sacramento, for example, may depend on tomato paste or bottles and caps from China. Amazon faces an additional wrinkle in keeping its virtual shelves stocked: While traditional retailers generally control their inventory directly, most of the products on Amazon are bought and sold by third-party merchants. Amazon simply facilitates those sales, giving it less visibility into supply. Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers, an Amazon spokeswoman said. The company later added, We are monitoring developments related to the coronavirus and taking appropriate steps as needed. Amazon's algorithms have now asked for six to eight weeks of supply on products made in China instead of just two or three weeks, said Mr. Hariharan, who discussed the changes with large brands that supply the retailer. Amazon has also made larger and more frequent buys, deviating from its regular cadence of automated purchases, according to company emails and consultants. Amazon issued off-cycle orders to you last night in order to prepare for possible supply chain disruptions due to recent global events originating in China, one recent email to a vendor read. Similar emails were earlier reported by Business Insider. Fahim Naim, who managed inventory at Amazon and now advises brands selling there, said it had placed extra orders from his clients who have more than $10 million in annual sales on the site and had marked China as the source of their products. Amazon's emails to his clients show that it is giving brands extra time to get their products to its warehouses without a penalty. On Feb. 7, the main Amazon website that sellers use to run their business posted a message that included tips for making sure Amazon's algorithms didn't ding their accounts if they couldn't fulfill orders. Jerry Kavesh, who offers Western wear like $85 cowboy boots on Amazon, is emblematic of the supply issues that its sellers face. Mr. Kavesh, 57, who is based in a Seattle suburb, said that the factory in China that produced his cowboy hats was closed and that he did not know when it would reopen. Even after the factory's workers return, the facility needs wool from its Chinese suppliers to make the hats. The key component ” they don't know when they are going to get that, he said. It takes about four months for his orders to be made and to arrive in the United States, Mr. Kavesh added. That means he typically would have products already in process for Prime Day, Amazon's two-day shopping deal extravaganza, which usually falls in early July. Updated May 20, 2020 Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea. Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. Amazon appears to share the concern. On Wednesday, it sent an email to a beauty supplies brand asking whether it expected to have enough of its top five products this summer. Amazon is trying to establish an inventory risk for your business moving forward and specifically for Prime Day, said the email, which The Times reviewed. We appreciate your feedback by TODAY. Mr. Naim said some brands he worked with had pulled back on their ads on Amazon by 25 percent to 50 percent, and had stopped promotions they had planned, to preserve money and inventory. Other sellers said they were contemplating whether to raise prices to prevent ” or at least delay ” running out of stock. Eddie Levine, who has been selling on Amazon since 2012, shipped more than 130 containers of toys, housewares and other goods from China last year, largely to offer on the site. He has cautioned the brands he works with against raising prices, saying that if a $20 product suddenly costs $40, the last thing you want is a bad review saying it's not worth $40. But if the virus disruptions persist into late spring or early summer, people will have to raise prices without even having the option because there is just no stock, Mr. Levine said. That's pure supply and demand. Karen Weise reported from Seattle, and Michael Corkery from New York.",business
By Keith Bradsher,2/20/2020,nytimes,"As China Fights the Coronavirus, Some Say It Has Gone Too Far",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/economy/china-economy-quarantine.html,"SHANGHAI ” China's business leaders know better than to argue with Beijing. Leave the politics to the Communist Party, they long ago concluded, and the government will let them make money in peace. A vicious viral outbreak has upended that formula. China's typically supercharged economy has ground to a near standstill as the authorities battle a coronavirus that has killed more than 2,000 people and sickened tens of thousands more. Hundreds of millions of people now live essentially in isolation, as roadblocks seal off entire towns and the local authorities stop companies from reopening. Business leaders and economists in China are increasingly saying, Enough. While China must stop the outbreak, they argue, some of its methods are hurting the lives and livelihoods of millions of people while contributing little to the containment effort. Strike a balance that is conducive to protecting lives, wrote James Liang, the executive chairman of Trip.com, China's dominant online travel agency, in a widely circulated essay this week. If the country becomes poorer because of emergency health measures, Mr. Liang warned, that might hurt public health more than the virus itself. No one questions that the disease is still a serious problem, particularly in Hubei Province and its capital, Wuhan. More than 70,000 people have been stricken, according to official figures. Foreign medical experts have suggested that the true total may be much higher. Nevertheless, business leaders and economists are beginning to ask whether mandatory 14-day quarantines, roadblocks and checkpoints are really required across much of the country, especially in provinces far from Hubei where there have been fairly few cases. The debate is unusual in a country where dissent is usually censored or squelched. Even topics like business and the economy, once considered relatively fair game for discussion, have become sensitive as China's economy has slowed and as the Communist Party has tightened its grip on more aspects of Chinese life. Still, even the Chinese government has acknowledged the wounds inflicted on the country's economy, further fueling national discussion of when enough might be enough.",business
By Matt Phillips,2/20/2020,nytimes,Surging Dollar Reflects the Standout U.S. Economy,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/strong-dollar-economy.html,"The dollar climbed to its highest level in years this week, a reflection of the standout status of the American economy against a global backdrop clouded by the coronavirus. Pessimistic economic updates from Japan, Britain and Germany have only added to the uncertainty created by the coronavirus, which all but idled China's economy for weeks. The slowdown has stimulated a rush into American stocks and bonds, as global investors exchanged their currencies for dollars ” pushing the value of the dollar higher ” and then used those dollars to snap up financial assets. People are spooked by the coronavirus, and the global economy is weakening. It's struggling mightily, said Bob Schwartz, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York. And whenever this happens, you see a capital flight into dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against six currencies of major trading partners, is up more than 3.6 percent this year, pushing it to its highest level since April 2017. It was up 0.2 percent on Thursday. The dollar has risen more than 1 percent against China's government-managed currency, the renminbi, in February alone. For the year, it's up more than 3.5 percent against the euro, 3 percent against the yen and more than 2.5 percent against the British pound. Those regions have faced a flurry of lackluster economic results. Official reports this month showed that the British economy flatlined during the fourth quarter. A report last week showed that the Japanese economy shriveled at a 6.3 percent annual clip during the fourth quarter, in part because of a tax increase. And this week, survey data about economic sentiment in Germany tumbled anew, as the country's manufacturing sector copes with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China, a key customer for its industrial goods and automobiles. Currencies are weakening on incoming bad data that leads to inflows into dollar assets, wrote Ben Emons, global macro strategist at Medley Global Advisors. While weakening foreign fundamentals have pushed money out of those markets, the relatively high interest rates in the United States have exerted a magnetic pull. Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds ” a benchmark for measuring investment returns ” are quite low by domestic standards, but they're downright generous compared with global rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was about 1.52 percent on Thursday, trouncing the negative yields of roughly 0.04 percent and 0.44 percent on 10-year government bonds from Japan and Germany. (Negative yields effectively mean that lenders are paying borrowers for the privilege of handing them money.) The strengthening dollar can be a boon for the American economy: It helps lower the costs of borrowing and makes imports cheaper, bolstering already strong consumer sentiment. But that dynamic can also have negative consequences. Despite the country's robust labor market, business investment has been shrinking and manufacturing has struggled since late 2018 ” and a strong dollar won't help those parts of the economy much. American exports such as aircraft, automobiles and soybeans become less competitive on global markets as the dollar rises in value. That, in turn, could weigh on the industrial manufacturers, from the makers of farm equipment to the factories that churn out piping for oil and gas extraction. A slowdown in foreign economic growth will also weaken overseas demand for American-made goods. There is no question that the industrial side of the economy continues to suffer the effects of weak global growth, the strong dollar, tariffs and trade uncertainty, Mr. Schwartz wrote in a recent client note. Those headwinds are not expected to vanish anytime soon.",business
By Roni Caryn Rabin,2/20/2020,nytimes,Why the Coronavirus Seems to Hit Men Harder Than Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/health/coronavirus-men-women.html,"The coronavirus that originated in China has spread fear and anxiety around the world. But while the novel virus has largely spared one vulnerable group ” children ” it appears to pose a particular threat to middle-aged and older adults, particularly men. This week, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published the largest analysis of coronavirus cases to date. Although men and women have been infected in roughly equal numbers, researchers found, the death rate among men was 2.8 percent, compared with 1.7 percent among women. The figures were drawn from patient medical records, and the sample may not fully reflect the scope of the outbreak. But the disparity has been seen in the past. Men also were disproportionately affected during the SARS and MERS outbreaks, which were caused by coronaviruses. More women than men were infected by SARS in Hong Kong in 2003, but the death rate among men was 50 percent higher, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. transcript Voices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare. People who are willing to speak out about the government's attempts to control news about the deadly coronavirus. They asked to remain anonymous, because what they're doing could put them and their families at great risk. But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens, fighting to get the message out in a country that aggressively censors information. Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech are quickly scrubbed from the internet. Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about life under lockdown. [clanging] Posted online one day, but gone the next. But the crisis over the coronavirus is changing the landscape, for now at least. Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting information the government doesn't want out there. Experts say this kind of digital resistance is happening at a scale they've never seen before. Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China. But internet savvy people use techniques that allow them to repost censored content to these platforms, while staying under the radar of authorities. They're creating a visual archive by preserving videos like this one, showing overwhelmed hospitals. [screaming] And they're reposting people's personal stories. Some are also turning to less obvious platforms, including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders. Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on? They're making open and widespread calls for freedom of speech. These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus, and was punished by officials for speaking out. He died in early February from the coronavirus. Right after his death, the hashtag I want freedom of speech started to trend on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. Then, it was quickly censored by the government. Dr. Li's become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who's winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance. Some 32 percent of men infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome died, compared with 25.8 percent of women. Young adult men also died at higher rates than female peers during the influenza epidemic of 1918. A number of factors may be working against men in the current epidemic, scientists say, including some that are biological, and some that are rooted in lifestyle. When it comes to mounting an immune response against infections, men are the weaker sex. This is a pattern we've seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract ” men can have worse outcomes, said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. We've seen this with other viruses. Women fight them off better, she added. Women also produce stronger immune responses after vaccinations, and have enhanced memory immune responses, which protect adults from pathogens they were exposed to as children. There's something about the immune system in females that is more exuberant, said Dr. Janine Clayton, director of the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health. But there's a high price, she added: Women are far more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system shifts into overdrive and attacks the body's own organs and tissues. Nearly 80 percent of those with autoimmune diseases are women, Dr. Clayton noted. The reasons women have stronger immune responses aren't entirely clear, and the research is still at an early stage, experts caution. One hypothesis is that women's stronger immune systems confer a survival advantage to their offspring, who imbibe antibodies from mothers' breast milk that help ward off disease while the infants' immune systems are still developing. A stew of biological factors may be responsible, including the female sex hormone estrogen, which appears to play a role in immunity, and the fact that women carry two X chromosomes, which contain immune-related genes. Men, of course, carry only one. Experiments in which mice were exposed to the SARS coronavirus found that the males were more susceptible to infection than the females, a disparity that increased with age. The male mice developed SARS at lower viral exposures, had a lower immune response and were slower to clear the virus from their bodies. They suffered more lung damage, and died at higher rates, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology at the University of Iowa who was the senior author of the study. When researchers blocked estrogen in the infected females or removed their ovaries, they were more likely to die, but blocking testosterone in male mice made no difference, indicating that estrogen may play a protective role. It's an exaggerated model of what happens in humans, Dr. Perlman said. The differences between men and women are subtle ” in mice, it's not so subtle. Health behaviors that differ by sex in some societies may also play a role in disparate responses to infections. China has the largest population of smokers in the world ” 316 million people ” accounting for nearly one-third of the world's smokers and 40 percent of tobacco consumption worldwide. But just over 2 percent of Chinese women smoke, compared with more than half of all men. Chinese men also have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, both of which increase the risk of complications following infection with the coronavirus. Rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are almost twice as high among Chinese men as among women.

They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. If you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance ” because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance ” you won't be able to get tested. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. In the United States, women are more proactive about seeking health care than men, and some small studies have found the generalization applies to Chinese students at universities in the United States, as well. In unpublished studies, Chinese researchers have emphasized that patients whose diagnoses were delayed, or who had severe pneumonia when they were first diagnosed, were at greatest risk of dying. One study of 4,021 patients with the coronavirus emphasized the importance of early detection, particularly in older men. And men have been turning up in hospitals with more advanced disease. But in areas of China outside Hubei Province, the disease's epicenter and where the majority of those affected are concentrated, the patterns are different: The disease appears to have dramatically lower mortality rates, and men are being infected at much higher rates than women, according to the Chinese C.D.C. analysis. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Men may have a false sense of security when it comes to the coronavirus, said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at Yale University who studies why some viruses affect women more severely. Gathering and analyzing data about the new virus by sex is important both for the scientists studying it and for the general public, experts said. Since the start of the outbreak, for example, public health officials have emphasized the importance of washing hands well and often, to prevent infection. But several studies have found that men ” even health care workers ” are less likely to wash their hands or to use soap than women, Dr. Klein said. We make these broad sweeping assumptions that men and women are the same behaviorally, in terms of comorbidities, biology and our immune system, and we just are not, Dr. Klein said.",business
By Tiffany May,2/20/2020,nytimes,"No More Hugging, No More Kissing.' At Home in Hong Kong With 2 Frontline Doctors.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/asia/coronavirus-hong-kong-doctor-SARS.html,"HONG KONG ” Eunice Chan, a physician in Hong Kong, removes her face mask only to shower, eat and drink. At dinner time, when her three daughters, ages 7, 9 and 12, gather around the dining table, she takes her meal in another room. There's no more hugging, no more kissing, she said. This is especially difficult for my youngest daughter. Her self-imposed isolation is not unwarranted. In Hong Kong, there have been two deaths and 68 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. And the semiautonomous Chinese city shares a porous border with the mainland, where 104 people on average have died of the disease every day since Feb. 1. The whole city is on edge. Medical experts have implored residents to wash their hands regularly and to wear surgical masks in public, resulting in a run on supplies and long lines outside pharmacies. But the risks, and anxieties, in the Chan household are particularly high. Both Dr. Chan, 44, and her husband, Dr. Pierre Chan, 43, have taken extraordinary measures to treat their patients and protect their family. Dr. Pierre Chan, a gastroenterologist at a public hospital and a member of Hong Kong's legislature, this month examined five patients infected with the coronavirus. Though he was wearing full protective gear and his hospital did not require him to go into quarantine, he slept on the floor of his office for 14 days to avoid the possibility of infecting his daughters and his in-laws. I don't dare go home, he said. I don't even dare to go into hotels. You never know: I could be asymptomatic. Maybe a tiny bit of the virus got onto my clothes. You don't want to affect your family under any circumstances, he added. Both were young physicians during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in the early 2000s. That crisis eventually sickened 386 medical workers in the city, killing four doctors, a nurse and three assistants. But they said they worried more about the current outbreak than they did about SARS. Back then, there was no situation like this, she said. The government has created an air of mistrust. Updated May 20, 2020 Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said. If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea. Taking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as normal temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing. If you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor.

That mistrust has resulted in thousands of medical workers striking to pressure the government to close the border and prevent mainland Chinese from entering the city; protesters setting fire to designated coronavirus clinics and quarantine centers; and a shortage of toilet paper after a rumor spread through the city that supplies would be restricted. SARS, they said, instilled in them an understanding of how easily epidemic infections can spread and how quickly life in the city can be upended by an outbreak. It also gave them an appreciation of how simple measures can be lifesaving. We witnessed the aftermath of SARS. We have seen people die, Dr. Pierre Chan said. Now, I know to be afraid. When he returned home on Sunday from his self-imposed quarantine, his daughters presented him with a drawing of him, bedecked with pink hearts and soccer balls. I was so happy to be back home, he said. But he kept his mask on, and he stopped himself from hugging them.",business
By Vivian Wang,2/20/2020,nytimes,"In a City Under Lockdown, Hope Arrives by Motorbike",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/business/china-coronavirus-wuhan-delivery.html,"The delivery driver did not want to go upstairs. The driver, Zhang Sai, hovered outside an apartment building in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak. He had been ordered not to take food to customers' doors in order to minimize the risk of infection. But the woman on the phone was pleading, he recalled. The food was for her mother, who couldn't go down to meet him. Mr. Zhang relented. He would drop off the order and sprint away. As he placed the bag on the floor, Mr. Zhang said, the door opened. Startled, he rushed away. Without thinking, he said, jabbed the elevator button with his finger, touching a surface he feared could transmit the virus. That was how Mr. Zhang, 32, found himself speeding back to his delivery station with one finger held aloft, careful not to touch the rest of his hand ”Β a quarantine in miniature. I was very scared, he recalled in a telephone interview. Because I ride a scooter, I felt the finger was like a flag. For many in China, delivery drivers like Mr. Zhang are the only connection to the outside world. Once a ubiquitous but invisible presence on the streets of nearly every Chinese city, the drivers are now being heralded as heroes. Throughout China, at least 760 million people ” almost a tenth of the world's population ” face some form of residential lockdown. The restrictions are particularly strict in Wuhan, where government efforts to contain the virus have barricaded most of the 11 million residents in their homes. Each household can send someone out for necessities just once every three days. Many residents do not venture outside at all, for fear of infection. Of the more than 2,200 deaths and 75,000 infections linked to the new virus, the majority have been in Wuhan. But people still have to eat ” which is why Mr. Zhang and legions of delivery drivers find themselves on the street each day. As Wuhan and the rest of the China hunkers down, they have become the country's vital arteries, keeping fresh meat, vegetables and other supplies flowing to those who need them. It is grueling and dangerous work. Mr. Zhang, who works for Hema, a supermarket chain owned by the tech giant Alibaba, crisscrosses the city armed only with the face masks and hand sanitizer that his company supplies each morning. His company uniform, bright blue with a hippo logo, tells the local authorities that he is allowed to be on the road. At night, he tries not to think about the epidemic. He listens to pop songs and looks for good news on TV. The dozens of trips he makes each day are born of not just Wuhan's necessity but his own. His wife and 4-year-old twin boys, as well as his father, rely on him for financial support. He never considered taking time off, even after the danger of the outbreak became clear. When his family asked him to stop, he ignored them, too. Mr. Zhang's family lives outside Wuhan, and he cannot visit because of the outbreak, but he video chats with them daily. If he goes fast and works long days, Mr. Zhang said, he could make about 8,000 yuan a month, or just over $1,100 ” more than he made in his previous job as a mail courier. The average monthly salary in Wuhan in 2017 was about 6,640 yuan, according to the data provider CEIC. Mr. Zhang and his colleagues offer one another a constantly updating stream of advice. It was one of Mr. Zhang's colleagues who told him to use a key to press elevator buttons. Another afternoon, someone said in the company group text that a suspected coronavirus patient had died in Neighborhood 125. Don't enter that area of Wuhan anymore, the message said. So damn unlucky, a colleague said. Those orders were assigned to me. So far, none of Mr. Zhang's co-workers have fallen sick, he said. The epidemic has brought some unexpected bright spots. Before, Mr. Zhang said, he sometimes ran red lights during rush hour in order to meet his delivery goals for the day. Now, the streets are empty. He has no problem getting around. People are nicer, too. Some customers barely opened the door or avoided eye contact. After the outbreak erupted, everyone said thank you. There's a saying: A man's words are kind when death is close,' Mr. Zhang said. Everybody is very tired. Everybody has been suffering for so long. Updated May 20, 2020 Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.

This week, the Wuhan authorities ordered neighborhoods to establish contactless delivery points. When Mr. Zhang has a delivery, he takes it to a designated checkpoint in the customer's neighborhood and leaves. By far the best change, though, has been to Mr. Zhang's after-work routine. Usually, he'd watch a movie or spend time with friends. Now, every night, he writes in a journal. Then he sends the entries to various online publications that ” much to his delight ”Β have begun sharing them. His first post was published Jan. 30, in the online magazine Single Read. It was called Self-narration of a Wuhan takeout worker. Since then, he has published five more. He writes of calling a friend to ask him to support his sons if he gets sick; of watching two older men play chess outdoors without masks; of taking in a crisp Wuhan day, with few around to share it. Normally, you would see more people sunbathing, playing chess, grocery shopping, doing nothing, he wrote in that entry, dated Jan. 30. Usually, I think they're too noisy. Only now do I discover a city without people yelling is boring. Mr. Zhang said he had always harbored literary aspirations. He has written novels, poems and fairy tales, but none of those earlier writings were published. He has only a middle school education, and thought that would put off editors. But they have published his entries after making only some grammatical changes, he said. He reads every comment left on his posts. Many people say they cannot believe a delivery driver wrote them. I think people like me because I'm just one of them, he said. Mr. Zhang plans to keep writing after the outbreak ends. He has already started taking fewer deliveries, to have more time to write. If outlets stop publishing his work, he'll keep making deliveries to earn money. But he will not stop writing. The epidemic has made many people close their mouths. It has made many of the unlucky among us close their mouths forever, Mr. Zhang wrote in one post. I want to talk now.",business
By Yi-Zheng Lian,2/20/2020,nytimes,Opinion,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/coronavirus-china-cause.html,"The new coronavirus disease has a name now: COVID-19. That took a while. The virus's genome was sequenced within two weeks or so of its appearance, but for many weeks more, we didn't know what to call it or the disease it causes. For a time, in some quarters, the disease went by Wuhan pneumonia, after the city in central China where the first human infections were detected. But guidelines from the World Health Organization, which christened COVID-19 recently, discourage naming diseases after locations or people, among other things, to avoid unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities. Indeed. On Jan. 29, an Australian tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch featured on its front page a red face mask stamped with Chinese Virus Pandamonium: The emphasis on panda was the paper's doing, so the misspelling it highlighted presumably was deliberate, too. A Chinese student in Melbourne protested in an op-ed in another paper, This virus is not Chinese.' Of course, the virus isn't Chinese, even if its origin eventually is traced back to a cave in China; nor is the disease that it causes. Epidemics, on the other hand, are often societal or political ” much like famines are usually man-made, even though droughts occur naturally. As far as the current outbreak goes, two cultural factors help explain how the natural occurrence of a single virus infecting a single mammal could have cascaded into a global health crisis. And now for the controversial aspect of this argument: Both of those factors are quintessentially, though not uniquely, Chinese. The first is China's long, long history of punishing the messenger. A doctor who had flagged on social media the risk of a possible viral outbreak was among several people summoned by the police in Wuhan in early January and warned not to spread rumors. He died recently after being infected with COVID-19. Similarly, the epidemic of SARS ” which is caused by another coronavirus ” that broke out in southern China in late 2002 was covered up by local authorities for more than a month, and the surgeon who first sounded the alarm was held in military detention for 45 days. In 2008, a scandal erupted over tainted baby formula, after major Chinese producers were found to have added melamine to milk powder. (Six infants died; 54,000 had to be hospitalized). Four years later the whistle-blower credited with first exposing the problem was stabbed to death under mysterious circumstances. These are recent examples, but that doesn't mean they should be pinned solely on the Chinese Communist Party: The practice of punishing whoever brings embarrassing truths has been the order of the day since at least the time of Confucius, in the sixth century B.C. The sage took a page from an even more ancient tract, The Classic of Poetry (also known as The Book of Songs), a collection of songs and poems dating to the 10th century B.C. or before, and adopted a rule from it: To Manifest the Way, First Keep Your Body Safe. (ζε“²δΏθΊ«) That may sound innocuous enough, until you consider the fate of one of Confucius's beloved students, Zi Lu (ε­θ·―), also known as Zhong You (δ»²η”±), after he ran afoul of the precept: For trying to rebuke a usurper in a power struggle between feudal lords, he was killed and his body was minced. (It is said that Confucius never ate ground meat again.) In the third century, the maxim took on some literary flair and a cynical didactic twist in an essay on fate by the philosopher Li Kang (ζεΊ·): The tree that grows taller than the forest will be truncated by gales (ζ¨η§€δΊζ—οΌιΆ¨εΏ…ε‚¬δΉ‹). This, in turn, eventually gave rise to the more familiar modern adage, The shot hits the bird that pokes its head out (ζ§ζ‰“ε‡Ίι ­ι³¥). Admittedly, China's rulers occasionally solicit honest views from their subjects ” but only of a certain kind or usually for a limited time. Mao Zedong, in his Hundred Flowers or Big Voices, Big Gripes (ε¤§ι³΄ε¤§ζ”Ύ) campaign of late 1956 and early 1957, called for the facts and critical opinions to be freely proffered. A few months later came the Anti-Rightist Movement (εε³ι‹ε‹•) ” during which hundreds of thousands of educated people who had spoken out were sent to jail, forced into exile or subjected to years of mistreatment, their careers and families destroyed. Punishing people who speak the truth has been a standard practice of China's ruling elite for more than two millenniums and is an established means of coercing stability. It is not an invention of modern China under the Communists ” although the party, true to form, has perfected the practice. And now, muzzling the messenger has helped spread the deadly COVID-19, which has infected some 75,000 people. A second cultural factor behind the epidemic are traditional Chinese beliefs about the powers of certain foods, which have encouraged some hazardous habits. There is, in particular, the aspect of Chinese eating culture known as jinbu, (ι€²θ£) meaning, roughly, to fill the void. Some of its practices are folklorish or esoteric, but even among Chinese people who don't follow them, the concept is pervasive. It is better to cure a disease with food than medicine, so starts the holistic theory. Illnesses result when the body is depleted of blood and energy ” though not the kind of blood and energy studied in biology and physics, but a mystic version. For men, it is most important to fill the energy void, which is related to virility and sexual prowess; for women, the stress is on replacing blood, which improves beauty and fertility. Rare plants and animals from the wild are thought to bring the best replenishment, especially when eaten fresh or raw. Winter is said to be the season when the body needs more jinbu foods. (Could that help explain why both SARS and the current epidemic broke out during that time of year?) Hard-core believers in jinbu seem to buy into this notion, too: Like-shapes eaten strengthen like-shapes (δ»¥ε½Άθ£ε½Ά), with the word shapes sometimes referring to human organs and their functions. Adherents count as favorites a long list of exotic foods ” whose methods of procurement or preparation can be outright cruel, with some simply too revolting to describe here. I've seen snakes and the penises of bulls or horses ” great for men, the theory goes ” on offer at restaurants in many cities in southern China. Bats, which are thought to be the original source of both the current coronavirus and the SARS virus, are said to be good for restoring eyesight ” especially the animals' granular feces, called sands of nocturnal shine (ε¤ζη ‚). Gallbladders and bile harvested from live bears are good for treating jaundice; tiger bone is for erections. More mundane yet no less popular is the palm civet (ζε­η‹Έ), a small, wild quadruped suspected of having passed on the SARS virus to humans. When stewed with snake meat, it is said to cure insomnia. Less wealthy people might turn to dog meat ” preferably a dog that has been chased around before being slaughtered, because some people believe that more jinbu benefits are reaped from eating an animal whose blood and energy ran high. Similarly, it is thought that animals killed just before serving are more jinbu potent, which is one reason the more exotic offerings in wet markets tend to be sold alive ” also making them more potent vectors for any virus they might carry. Eating exotic wildlife has long been endorsed by scholars and elevated to mystical heights, including in the medical treatise The Inner Bible of the Yellow Emperor (ι»ƒεΈε†…η¶“), written some 2,000 years ago and still revered by many health-conscious Chinese today. Beliefs surrounding the health benefits of certain wildlife foods ” which are discussed in newspaper columns and on numerous dedicated internet sites, as well as taught in China's medical schools ” permeate the culture. True, these practices are not legion across China. Nor are they uniquely Chinese: Many peoples in many other countries eat exotic foods, too. But what is notable about China is that these beliefs about the special powers of some foods have been accepted, are now a given, even among people who do not put them into practice. They have become firmly embedded in the Chinese collective consciousness. And so there are strong reasons to say that the current outbreak of COVID-19 has been aided by two fundamentally Chinese cultural practices. This may be discomfiting to hear; the notion might even strike some people as offensive. But it is necessary to investigate all the causes behind this deadly epidemic, whatever their nature ” because if we don't, we will only be inviting the next one.

Callum Hoare,2/20/2020,express,End of the world: Locust plague approaches Egypt sparking Bible apocalypse fears,https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/1244004/end-world-locust-plague-bible-apocalypse-egypt-book-exodus-jesus-christ-israel-spt," A plague of locusts has made its way through Africa along the Red Sea coast and towards Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The swarm of billions of crop-devouring grasshoppers arrived after a period of heavy rain in October 2018 and wreaked devastation on countries in the Horn of Africa, with experts predicting the outbreak to grow 400 times the current size by June 2020. Yesterday, they were spotted close to Eastern Equatoria on the South Sudanese border with Kenya and Ethiopia, suggesting they are heading northbound towards Egypt.  In the Plagues of Egypt “ a story depicted in the Book of Exodus “ God inflicts 10 disasters, or plagues, on the Egyptian people as the Pharaoh refuses to accept Moses' demands for the Israelites to be freed from their chains of slavery. Exodus 10:12-15 reads: ""And the Lord said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail'. ""So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the Lord made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. ""By morning the wind had brought the locusts; 14 they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers.   Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields Book of Exodus ""Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail “ everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt."" The story is hugely significant in a religious context but also in popular folklore. Locusts have come to be seen by many as a symbol of doom or even the coming of the end of the world. READ MORE: End of the world: Coronavirus panic and African locust plague spark Bible apocalypse fears  Save the Children's Country Director in South Sudan, Rama Hansraj, said today that he fears the locusts could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. He said: Our team in South Sudan has been watching the devastating progress of the desert locusts across the Horn in despair. We fear that the situation in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, which is already serious, will be magnified if the locusts reach South Sudan. Last year we had a prolonged, damaging drought, followed by floods, which displaced thousands of people and destroyed hundreds of homes, and the country is still reeling from years of conflict. A swarm of locusts could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. DON'T MISS:Antarctica: Scientists make breakthrough over dinosaur-extinction [VIDEO]NASA asteroid revelation: Space rock 'threatens' Earth “ researcher [ANALYSIS]Asteroid tsunami: Why scientist offered dire warning to US coast [COMMENT]   Biblical preachers have already claimed that the plague could be a sign of the end times, too. Melvin Sandelin said on his Christian Life YouTube channel it is just part of the process for the return of Jesus Christ. He also pointed out the recent tensions with Iran and the outbreak of the coronavirus were further examples that the apocalypse is near. Yesterday, claims even surfaced that Seventh Seal of the Book of Revelations had been broken after the swarm reached China. Paranormal investigator Ciaran Aughey, questioned on his YouTube channel: Is this the biblical end of times?

The reason the former bloc had fallen was not because of a need for reform or a rejection of communism, in his view, but rather it was the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 that led the Soviet Union to fracture. He said: The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl, even more than my launch of Perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later. On April 25, 1986, a reactor at the nuclear power plant near the city of Pripyat in Ukraine exploded, leading to a vast and deadly spread of radiation. However, despite being the worst nuclear accident in history, the rest of the world would not become aware immediately as the Soviet leadership tried desperately to cover up the humiliating event. Mr Gorbachev tried to persuade both people at home and around the world that the explosion was a minor event that requires no special measures to protect the population"". However, the Chernobyl disaster did not remain concealed for long, as the radiation reached a nuclear power plant in Sweden, where researchers were able to trace the deadly materials all the way back to the Ukraine.   The consequences of the cover-up were embarrassing for the Soviet leadership, but history does not appear to have dissuaded China President Xi Jinping from adopting a similar approach to the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The Communist Party in Beijing has faced growing questions over efforts to prevent news of the virus' spread getting out of the country. Doctors in Wuhan warned of the outbreak, but were silenced by the government. Li Wenliang was the Chinese doctor whose warnings were shared around the world last December, but Wuhan police summoned and admonished him for ""making false comments on the Internet"". READ MORE:Coronavirus latest: Disease could spread FASTER than SARS   Li returned to work, later contracting the virus from an infected patient and dying from the disease on February 7. Xi's attempts to conceal the growing crisis have failed, as international headlines are now covering developments amid increased scrutiny on China's leadership. Last week, after nearly two months of inaction, the Chinese President was seen on the streets of his nation's capital as state controlled media described his dedication to tackling the problem. Xi had been criticised for distancing himself from the crisis, and now Beijing academics are calling for an end to the one party system and freedom of speech.

"Clare Duffy, CNN Business",2/20/2020,cnn,Apple needs a 5G iPhone now more than ever,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/20/tech/apple-coronavirus-5g-iphone/index.html," Whatever high Apple executives were on in January after the company posted record earnings and strong iPhone sales during the holiday quarter has likely faded. The tech giant is having a rough month. The iPhone maker has been hit harder than expected by the coronavirus outbreak . The company told investors earlier this week that it no longer expects to meet revenue guidance it provided only last month for the current quarter, which ends in March. Travel restrictions, limited store hours and disruptions at factories in China are keeping Apple ( AAPL ) from selling and making as many devices as it had hoped. The situation raises the stakes for key product releases slated for later this year. In order to make up for the decline in performance caused by coronavirus, the company will need to drum up demand for new iPhones, which are still its biggest revenue driver. Apple has a big tool in its arsenal this year: A 5G-enabled iPhone that is widely expected to be released in September. Some analysts expect the 5G iPhone to trigger a ""super cycle"" of device upgrades. ""Every time there's a big step function, from 3G to 4G and 4G to 5G, that easily will be another big uptick in the driver of the iPhone units,"" said Keith Gangl, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. Read More But there are questions about whether ongoing disruptions caused by coronavirus could cause problems for ” or even delay ” the 5G iPhone release that many are counting on to provide a big boost to the company. Apple said Tuesday it would no longer meet the $63 billion to $67 billion sales projection it gave for the current quarter when it reported earnings last month. That guidance range was already wider than usual, which Apple hoped would account for the potential impacts of coronavirus. Apple revenue will be hit as coronavirus creates iPhone supply shortages, company warns Tuesday's announcement creates additional uncertainty because Apple didn't specify how far off its projections it would be, or how much of the miss is due to supply constraints versus a drop in demand, Gangl said. ""The virus itself is a moving target, so it's hard to speculate what it will mean for the suppliers and for demand. We need more data and more time,"" Gangl said. There are some indications that it's more of a supply issue. On Wednesday, Nikkei reported that Apple will likely miss its schedule for releasing a more affordable version of the iPhone S this spring,citing sources familiar with the matter. Around 15 million to 17 million units of the updated iPhone S were set for release in March, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN Business. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The less expensive iPhone S is another way for Apple to convince customers -- especially those reluctant to shell out for premium models -- to upgrade their phones. That could have helped boost the company's sales during the March quarter, especially ahead of the typically slow summer quarter. But Ives said the new phone's release will now likely be pushed into April. ""This doesn't significantly move the needle,"" Ives said. ""But it is another indication of just how dramatically the supply chain has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus tragedy."" Some analysts worry that the delay of the cheaper iPhone S could be a harbinger for the 5G model later this year, if coronavirus continues to weigh on Apple's supply chain. ""The impact of the constrained manufacturing environment in China on the production of the new iPhones expected to launch in September remains unclear at this point, but supply constraints are possible,"" Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White said in an investor note. White added that coronavirus-related manufacturing disruptions in China could also limit production of the equipment used to build 5G wireless networks, which are key to getting customers to adopt 5G devices. A delay in the release of the 5G iPhone would be a blow to Apple, especially after its main competitor, Samsung ( SSNLF ) , released a full line of 5G-enabled phones earlier this month. ""The stock is priced for a 5G upcycle,"" Gradient's Gangl said. ""It depends on how long it gets pushed. If it's weeks, it could be okay. If they miss the holiday season, that could be a problem."" Wedbush's Ives agreed, calling the 5G iPhone the ""heart and lungs of the super cycle thesis."" ""If those get delayed by a few weeks, a month, it would impact the quarterly trajectory but it's not something that would be overly concerning to investors,"" Ives said. ""If it gets delayed three to six months, that could be a problem."" The next update on where things stand will likely come when Apple reports earnings for the current quarter in April.",general

Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images The price of gold rose 0.7%  on Thursday to $1,619.05 an ounce”a level it hasn't touched since February 2013. Gold has rallied more than 20% in the past year. Global economic uncertainty, buying by central banks, and low interest rates have all pushed the price of the metal higher , which is viewed as a haven asset. The latest push has likely been the coronavirus outbreak . That has helped shares of gold miners, including Newmont Corp. and
        Barrick Gold . Both companies merged with rivals in 2019, moves that Barron's was bullish on at the start of last year.

The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF has returned 30% in the past 12 months, while the smaller-cap-focused VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF returned 28.7%. Canaccord Genuity analyst Martin Roberge has an Overweight rating on gold and gold miners. He notes that, despite the S&P 500 pushing to record highs, gold has risen above its levels from August. Its rise has also coincided with a strengthening dollar“another contradiction unless gold is on the rise as a safety bet. He also notes gold has historically performed well in low-interest-rate environments. The Toronto Stock Exchange Global Gold index (TTGD) topped its August 2019 high on Wednesday, and was nearing its July 2016 peak at about  279 Canadian dollars (US$210.51) on Thursday. Roberge argued that the 2016 peak could be the last resistance before gold breaks out into a second phase of its bull run. Historically when that happens, gold equities average 159% returns through the peak of that phase, based on his analysis. This means that once above the July 2016 peak, the TSX gold index should challenge its all-time high seen in September 2011, an 84% ramp from here, he wrote.

Some cited the Democratic presidential debates as a potential factor keeping markets in check, while ongoing concerns like the COVID-19 outbreak remained on the radar screen. As of 11 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 11 points to 29,359. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^SPX) rose 1 point to 3,387, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^COMP) was down a point at 9,817. The brokerage industry has been rife with consolidation recently, and another big strategic move brought investors' attention to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC). Meanwhile, earnings season brought a pleasant surprise to shareholders in Stamps.com (NASDAQ:STMP), as the beleaguered shipping specialist got a long-awaited boost. Shares of E*Trade Financial jumped 25% after Morgan Stanley announced it would acquire the discount broker. The acquisition will mark the latest combination between major players in the financial industry, reflecting the increased importance of wooing ordinary retail investors over institutional clients. Morgan Stanley said that it would pay $13 billion for E*Trade in the all-stock deal. Under its terms, E*Trade shareholders will receive 1.0432 shares of Morgan Stanley per share of E*Trade stock. As often happens with stock-based mergers, Morgan Stanley stock gave up ground, but losses were limited to about 3%. Many had predicted that E*Trade would eventually attract takeover interest. The high-profile merger of Schwab and TD Ameritrade created a colossus in the retail discount brokerage industry, leaving E*Trade at a significant competitive disadvantage. Finding a partner was the best way for the much smaller E*Trade to compete with a combined Schwab/TD Ameritrade, as well as other big players in the retail investing space. Meanwhile, for Morgan Stanley, the acquisition is in line with the strategic vision that many other institutionally focused financial institutions have taken in appealing to a broader audience. With Morgan Stanley's extensive wealth management business joining forces with E*Trade's broader client base, the combined company will become a new force to be reckoned with in the brokerage industry. Shares of Stamps.com posted even larger gains, picking up more than 60%. The mailing and postage specialist's fourth-quarter financial report raised hopes that the long-suffering company could have a viable path toward a full recovery. Last year's announcement that Stamps.com would no longer have exclusive rights to U.S. Postal Service postage online raised fears that the company's business model was irretrievably broken. Stamps.com's fourth-quarter numbers did reflect significant downward impacts from the USPS move, including a revenue drop of 5% and a decline of 43% in adjusted earnings per share. Yet Stamps.com's outlook for 2020 was much better than many had expected. The online shipping specialist forecast sales of between $570 million and $600 million, producing adjusted earnings of $4 to $5 per share. CEO Ken McBride detailed the ways that Stamps.com will work in partnership with the USPS, as well as United Parcel Service and other e-commerce players going forward. Shareholders liked what they saw, and if Stamps.com can make good on all the potential business in front of it, the stock could keep climbing back toward the much higher levels it reached in 2018.",business
"David Cyranoski,Nature magazine",2/20/2020,scientificamerican,Scientists Question China's Decision Not to Report Symptom-Free Coronavirus Cases,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-question-chinas-decision-not-to-report-symptom-free-coronavirus-cases/,"Researchers are concerned that China's official reports on the number of coronavirus infections have not been including people who have tested positive for the virus but who have no symptoms. They fear the practice is masking the epidemic's true scale. But public health experts say China is right to prioritize tracking sick patients who are spreading the disease. Since the early days of the outbreak, the country's National Health Commission has reported daily infection counts, which infectious-disease researchers outside China have been relying on to model the outbreak's spread and severity. Earlier this month, officials from Heilongjiang province in northeast China announced that 13 people who had tested positive for the virus with a lab test but who had no symptoms had been removed from the region's list of confirmed cases. Officials said that they were following the commission's guidelines for reporting infections, which state that such people should be classified as positive cases' rather than confirmed cases'. Only confirmed cases are noted in the commission's official daily reports. The situation in Heilongjiang has put a spotlight on China's reporting guidelines. These had already been getting attention after they were updated on 7 February to allow physicians to confirm cases using images from chest scans rather than waiting days for lab tests. The change in diagnostic criteria saw infections in Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic, jump by nearly 15,000 cases in a single day last week. Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, who helps to implement the guidelines, says that they have always required that positive cases not be counted as confirmed cases. Instead, those who test positive are isolated for 14 days and monitored by health authorities. If they develop symptoms in that period, they are classified as a confirmed case. Wu says that a positive test doesn't necessarily mean that a person is infected with the virus. Lab tests typically detect genetic material from the virus in throat or nasal swabs, but in some people the virus might not have entered cells and started replicating, he says. But it's not clear whether such carriers', who test positive for the virus but are not actually infected, exist. That is one of the big scientific questions, he says. But several infectious-disease researchers outside China who spoke toΒ NatureΒ disagree. A virus usually has to replicate inside a host to reach detectable levels, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. If the virus is in a person's nose but hasn't infected any cells, then I'm sceptical that virus in a nasal swab from this type of exposure would be detectable, she says. Omitting these cases from official counts gives the impression that the virus is more severe than it really is, says Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. This could mislead other countries that are trying to prepare for the most likely effects of an epidemic of the disease, known as COVID-19, in their population, says Mackay. Not counting asymptomatic cases also hampers efforts to model the virus to understand its extent and spread, says Michael Mina, an infectious-disease immunologist and epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. Epidemiologists try to piece together chains of transmission, and they might include people who are infected by have no symptoms, says Mina. He and other researchers suspect that many more people have been infected than the 74,000-odd cases that have been reported, and that most cases are probably asymptomatic and would be positive if tested. Tarik JaΕ΅areviΔ‡, spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, said that from a public health point of view, it makes sense for China to focus on recording numbers of patients who have symptoms because those people seem to be the ones transmitting the virus to others. Mina says that China is probably also prioritizing care for the sick, and maintaining quarantines, rather than measuring the epidemic's dynamics. From a clinical perspective, the exclusion of asymptomatic patients from case counts is justified, because if a person has no symptoms, they don't need medical treatment. If I put on my medical hat for a moment, I can understand the decision not to count these individuals, he says.

Samuel Tombs, the Chief UK Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, was more optimistic, saying that January's retail sales figures had confirmed that December's general election had released the handbrake on the political uncertainty that was holding back the British economy. However, Sterling continues to be restrained by concerns over post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the EU after the UK's Chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said he was not seeking alignment with the bloc. Stefaan De Rynck, Senior Advisor to the Chief EU Brexit Negotiator, also added that trade talks between the two could get rather difficult. As a result, the pound to euro has remained subdued with concerns rising that the UK could face a no-deal scenario later on this year. The euro clawed back some of its losses despite today's release of Germany's GfK Consumer Confidence Survey, which revealed a stagnation in consumer sentiment. GfK's consumer expert Rolf BΓΌrkl comments on the data: The consumer climate has been unable to continue the previous month's positive trend. The spread of the coronavirus has undoubtedly contributed to uncertainty among consumers. A decline or halt in production in companies in China triggered by the virus could affect production in Germany as well, or even cause it to come to a complete standstill. The single currency's gains, however, are likely to remain short-lived due to speculation surrounding next month's European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting. Looking ahead to tomorrow, we could see the pound to euro exchange rate edge higher if the UK's flash Markit Services PMI shows an uptick in February.

Most of that economic impact will likely be felt in the first quarter of this year, the report said, with a recovery firmly in place by the third quarter. Based on that slowdown, S&P Global estimates that the share of questionable loans could rise from 6.5% to 7.5% of all loans before the outbreak to a peak of about 10.5% to 11.5% in the aftermath of the epidemic. The rise in bad loans comes as Chinese bank regulators have been working to tighten accounting standards. S&P Global analysts said the coronavirus crisis will likely slow those reforms, as authorities focus instead on financial and social stability. ” Schoen Kuwait Airways suspended all flights to Iran starting on the advice of the Kuwaiti health ministry and civil aviation authority amid fears about a coronavirus outbreak in the country. Kuwait Airways is the second flagship carrier in the region to suspend flights to Iran after Iraq Airways stopped flights earlier in the day. Two Iranians who tested positive for the coronavirus have died of respiratory illness, and three others tested positive, the Iranian health ministry said. ” Reuters World health officials said that the new coronavirus has not yet spread widely around the world, but emphasized that the virus could break out globally at any time. ""The number of cases in the rest of the world is very small compared to what we have in China, but that may not stay the same for long,"" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at the organization's headquarters in Geneva on Thursday. ”Lovelace Ukraine's effort to quarantine more than 70 people evacuated from China over the new virus outbreak plunged into chaos Thursday as local residents opposing the move engaged in violent clashes with police. Several hundred residents of the village of Novi Sanzhary in Ukraine's central Poltava region blocked the road to a sanitarium intended to host the evacuees. Demonstrators put up road blocks, burned tires and clashed with riot police who moved to clear access. More than 10 people were detained, and Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov personally visited the site of the protests to try to calm the crowd down. Avakov urged the protesters ""not to fall for provocations and be understanding of the necessity for these temporary measures."" ” Associated Press Preliminary results from two clinical trials testing potential treatments for the COVID-19 coronavirus are expected in three weeks, the World Health Organization said Thursday. One trial combines HIV drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir, while the other is testing U.S.-based biotech Gilead Sciences' antiviral Remdesivir, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday at a news conference at the agency's headquarters. ” Lovelace Global air travel demand is set to decline for the first time since 2009 because of coronavirus, the International Air Transport Association said Thursday. Pauses in corporate travel and overall slumping demand due to warnings of the rapidly-spreading illness have prompted carriers to suspend service or drastically reduce China service. The outbreak will cost Chinese airlines $12.8 billion in revenue and nearly $29 billion for carriers in the Asia-Pacific region, IATA estimated. The trade group, which represents most of the world's airlines, had forecast demand growth in 2020 of 4.1%, which it's now revised to a contraction of 0.6%. ” Josephs The FBI has ordered $40,000 of hand sanitizer and face masks ""in case the coronavirus becomes a pandemic in the United States,"" according to the acquisition document. The FBI's ""pandemic preparedness"" supply order includes face masks from manufacturer 3M and disinfectants, including hand sanitizer, from PDI Healthcare, the document said. In its purchase order, the FBI said it needs to have those items on hand if the coronavirus, or COVID-19, spreads widely throughout the U.S. The masks and disinfectants ""are to be stored throughout the country for distribution in the event of a declared pandemic,"" according to the document, which was signed Friday and gave the companies a week to fulfill the order. ” Feuer Japan's government and auto industry are establishing a new task force to combat the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the country's automotive operations. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said the immediate priorities for the ""New Coronavirus Countermeasures Automobile Council"" will be information sharing and understanding of the situation as well as studying countermeasures. ""Automakers, component manufacturers, and the government work together to ensure rapid response to the information on the industry, with a view to ensuring that measures can be taken to prepare for the possible impact of the new coronavirus on the automotive supply chain in the future,"" the Japanese government said. ” Wayland Apple iPhone maker Foxconn said it is cautiously restarting production at its main plants in China and warned revenue will be hurt this year by the outbreak. The statement comes just days after Apple rescinded its March quarter sales guidance, saying factories in China have been slower to get back to work than first anticipated after Lunar New Year holidays were extended amid the outbreak. Foxconn, the world No. 1 contract manufacturer, also said its plants in countries such as Vietnam, India, and Mexico continue to operate at full capacity with expansion plans underway as it seeks to minimize the impact of the virus. ” Reuters Norwegian Cruise Line said it has canceled voyages in Asia through the third quarter and expects to take an earnings hit of 75 cents per share for the full year because of the outbreak. The news sent shares down by about 3% in morning trading. The cruise line said the virus had forced it to cancel, modify or redeploy 40 voyages across all three of its brands and compensate customers. The company said that 21 cancelled Asia voyages on its cruise ship, Norwegian Spirit, have been redeployed to the Eastern Mediterranean for summer 2020 with an ""extremely condensed booking window."" Any guest or crew who have traveled to China, Hong Kong or Macau in the past 30 days, regardless of nationality, are not allowed to board Norwegian's vessels. ” Miller WHO officials are holding a press conference at 10 am ET to update the public on the coronavirus outbreak. The United Nation's health agency declared the virus, named COVID-19, a global health emergency last month. On Thursday, China's National Health Commission reported an additional 114 deaths and 394 new confirmed cases, which is a drastic drop in daily additional cases. However, China revised its diagnostic guidelines to exclude ""clinically diagnosed"" cases from the count in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak ” thereby lowering the count. Watch the live press conference here. ” Feuer Procter & Gamble, the maker of everyday household goods like Pampers diapers and Gillette razors, is continuing to grapple with problems getting materials from suppliers and its good delivered to customers in China, its second-largest market outside the U.S. The company's Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said at a conference in Boca Raton, Florida that store traffic in China has fallen ""considerably."" Although some demand has shifted to online sales, there are hurdles to fulfilling those orders, like the number of delivery people, Moeller said. P&G also relies on 387 Chinese suppliers, who provide materials for more than 17,000 finished products sold globally. Although the consumer giant expects to be ""materially impacted"" by the outbreak in its second-largest market, Moeller reaffirmed the company's forecasted ranges for its revenue and earnings for fiscal 2020. ” Lucas The CDC has been working with the health-care sector to prepare for a possible pandemic outbreak in the United States. The coronavirus threat comes at an already busy time for most U.S. hospitals. Another serious respiratory illness, the seasonal flu, is at its peak, with more than 26 million cases and many hospitals stretched thin. A larger spread of the new virus across the U.S. could overwhelm emergency rooms and quickly cause supply shortages of some crucial medical supplies, according to half a dozen interviews with doctors, U.S. hospitals and health systems. ” Lovelace Shipping giant Maersk warned that the coronavirus outbreak would weigh on earnings this year, compounding the woes of a container shipping industry already hit by trade wars and an economic slowdown. The Danish company on Thursday reported a lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and forecast a weak start to the year because factories in China were closed for longer than usual after the Lunar New Year holiday. ""Weekly container vessel calls at key Chinese ports were significantly down compared to last year during the last weeks of January and the first weeks of February,"" the world's biggest container shipping firm said in a statement. It reiterated, however, a forecast for growth in global container demand of 1% to 3% this year, saying Chief Executive Soren Skou remained optimistic about a rebound in the second quarter. Global container demand grew 1.4% in 2019 and 3.8% the year before. ” Reuters Air France-KLM warned of a 150 million to 200 million euro ($162 million to $216 million) hit to earnings by April as it contends with the epidemic's ""brutal"" impact on the airline industry. The Franco-Dutch group's shares fell sharply after its full-year results and 2020 outlook, which was in the spotlight as markets watch for economic effects well beyond the Asian center of the outbreak. Like many global airlines, Air France-KLM has canceled flights to mainland China until the end of March, basing its impact estimate on the assumption that flights will then gradually resume. ""That's the hypothesis we're using for the moment, but we don't know how credible it is,"" Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said. ""Obviously if it lasts longer, the impact will be heavier."" ” Reuters Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics and the biggest assembler of Apple products, said Thursday it is cautiously restarting production at its main plants in China, Reuters reported, but it warned revenue will be hurt this year by the coronavirus epidemic. China's Hubei province has asked firms not to resume work before March 11 due to the outbreak, although those involved in epidemic prevention and control and public utilities are exempt. The suspension of work for many firms was due to end on Wednesday.

Dominic Chopping,2/20/2020,marketwatch,Maersk warns of coronavirus impact as earnings miss expectations,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/maersk-warns-of-coronavirus-impact-as-earnings-miss-expectations-2020-02-20?mod=article_inline,"Danish shipping giant A.P. Moeller-Maersk AS said Friday that it made weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and warned that it expects a weak start to the year with limited visibility for the rest of 2020 amid the coronavirus outbreak. Maersk MAERSK.A, -0.19% MAERSK.B, -0.19% swung to an unexpected net loss in the quarter of $72 million from a profit of $46 million in the year-earlier period. A FactSet analyst poll had expected a net profit of $343 million. It said that its financials are materially impacted by implementing the IFRS 16 accounting standard and 2019 figures aren't comparable with last year. Maersk, which is considered a barometer of global trade, saw revenue fall 5.6% to $9.67 billion, missing expectations of $9.94 billion, as its shipping unit lowered capacity to adjust to market conditions. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the quarter came in at $1.46 billion against expectations for $1.53 billion. For the full-year, Ebitda rose to $5.71 billion, meeting the company's own guidance of between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion. The company's main shipping unit saw revenue fall as volumes dropped 1.8% while freight rates slipped 0.4%. Maersk said it continued to cut its cost base at the unit while lower fuel prices also helped offset some of the weakness. Volumes were hit in both East-West and North-South routes, amid continued slower growth in the U.S. and front loading of orders in the same quarter last year ahead of anticipated tariffs, lower demand in Europe, continued weak demand in Latin America, and weakened market conditions in West and Central Asia and Oceania. Maersk said the outlook and guidance for 2020 is subject to significant uncertainties and impacted by the current outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has significantly lowered visibility on what to expect in 2020. As factories in China are closed for longer than usual in connection with the Chinese New Year and as a result of the COVID-19, we expect a weak start to the year, the company said. The organic volume growth in its main ocean unit is expected to be in line with or slightly lower than the estimated 2020 average market growth of 1% to 3%. Accumulated gross capex for 2020-2021 is still expected to be $3.0 billion-$4.0 billion. Maersk declared an unchanged full-year dividend of DKK150.",business
Ed Yong,2/20/2020,theatlantic,A Ton of Giant Viruses Are Living in Your Mouth,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/oh-look-ton-giant-viruses-inside-your-mouth/606763/,"Your mouth is currently teeming with giant viruses that, until very recently, no one knew existed. Unlike Ebola or the new coronavirus that's currently making headlines, these particular viruses don't cause disease in humans. They're part of a group known as phages, which infect and kill bacteria. But while many phages are well studied, these newly discovered giants are largely mysterious. Why are they 10 times bigger than other phages? How do they reproduce? And what are they up to inside our bodies? They're in our saliva, and in our gut, says Jill Banfield of the University of California, Berkeley, who led the team that discovered the new phages. Who knows what they're doing? From what Banfield and her team have been able to tell, though, these giants defy some fundamental ideas about how viruses usually work. And, even if it's not yet clear how, they are likely affecting us. Banfield's team found the huge phages by accident. She and her colleagues were studying the gut bacteria of Bangladeshi people who live near arsenic-contaminated groundwater, to see whether those microbes can detoxify arsenic. They can't. But among the bacterial DNA, the team also noticed the unexpectedly massive genomes of several new phages. An average phage carries about 52,000 letters worth of DNA, but these giants carried more than 540,000. And though the team first noticed them in Bangladeshi guts, they also found them in people from Tanzania, in pigs from Denmark, and in baboons from Kenya.",general

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed down 0.6% provisionally, with insurance stocks shedding 1.7% to lead losses while auto shares were among the only gainers, climbing 0.7%. European markets are bucking the trend seen from their Asian counterparts, where stocks advanced Thursday on hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could be slowing amid a decline in the number of new cases of the virus, and from extra stimulus measures from China. On Wall Street, market sentiment was broadly negative, with all the major indexes falling around 1%. As of February 20, China's National Health Commission reported an additional 114 deaths from the virus, and 394 new confirmed cases. That brings the total deaths in the mainland to 2,118 and the confirmed cases to 74,576 cases. The number of new cases was drastically lower than the 1,749 reported the day before. It came a day after Beijing altered its previous diagnosis protocol. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session as concerns over possible supply disruptions and a decline in demand were allayed with the sharp drop in new coronavirus cases. In corporate news, UBS has announced that ING Groep's Ralph Hamers will succeed outgoing CEO Sergio Ermotti in November, becoming the second major Swiss lender this month to replace its CEO. Shares of both banks were slightly higher by the close. On the data front, U.K. retail sales rebounded in January to rise 0.9% on the month, following a 0.5% fall in December, Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. Earnings are a key driver of individual share price action Thursday. Shares of Sweden's Elekta tumbled 7% after the medical equipment maker missed third-quarter profit expectations amid a sharp fall in U.S. orders. Air France KLM reported a fall in profits in 2019 and warned that the coronavirus could hit its operating profit by up to 200 million euros between February and April ($215.75 million). The Franco-Dutch carrier saw its shares slide over 3%. Telefonica stock fell almost 4% after swinging to a fourth-quarter net loss, while Swiss Re dropped more than 7% to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 after missing 2019 profit expectations. At the top of the European benchmark, Tomra systems surged 19% to a record high after strong fourth-quarter earnings, while Moneysupermarket also jumped nearly 19% on the back a return to profit growth and stronger 2019 revenue.",finance
